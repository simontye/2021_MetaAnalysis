Therefore, we integrated behavioral and direst cover type data to test hypotheses underlying the choice of two key cover types used by male Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) in northern Minnesota, USA. Forests of aspen (Populus spp.) are the presumptive highest quality cover type for Ruffed Grouse because this bird species achieves its highest breeding densities in this cover type. Yet, males select cover types of conifer even when nearby cover types of aspen remain vacant. We examined this conundrum - selection of inferior cover types when presumed better types are available - by randomly selecting 23 male Ruffed Grouse from among a contiguous population of territorial males and used automated video systems to monitor their breeding display behavior. We predicted that if conifer cover types were indeed inferior habitat for Ruffed Grouse, males that established territories in these cover types would either drum (auditory display) more frequently to attract mates or have fewer conspecific interactions, detected by observing visual display rates, than males which established territories in aspen cover types. We used drumming rates and visual display rates as two separate response variables, and used generalized linear models to evaluate each of these response variables as a function of several predictors in a priori models including cover type, male density on the study area, distance to the nearest neighbor, cover type of the nearest neighbor, and distance to the nearest neighbor in aspen cover. Information-theoretic model selection was used to rank these models with Akaike's Information Criterion adjusted for small sample sizes. The best predictor (top model) of drumming rates among our model set, was cover type, but our null model was competitive, which suggested uncertainty in our result. We were unable to explain visual display rates given our model set and predictor variables, because our intercept only [null] model was the top model, which suggested visual display behavior was not correlated with either cover type or the other factors we included in models. We conclude the reason grouse select display sites likely has more to do with suitable protective cover (i.e., predator avoidance) than with the general classification (aspen vs. conifer) of the cover type. Thus, the link between relative fitness and habitat selection of specific cover types is more likely to be revealed by studying the habitat requirements and survival probabilities of females visiting males which occupy these two prominent breeding display covers.","[Berkeley, Lorelle I.; Gutierrez, R.

This paper employs an individual-based population growth model to extrapolate the death rate function in a well-studied coral reef fish, the bridled goby Coryphopterus glaucofraenum, from the scale of 2 m x 2 m coral reef cells at which it was measured to the larger scale of an entire coral reef. Density dependence in the whole-reef function actually proves stronger than in the local function because high goby density occasionally arises in local patches with few refuges from predators, producing very high mortality there. This IBM-based approach extends the reach of scale transition theory by examining considerably more realistic models than standard analytical methods can presently handle. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Although frequently studied in the context of predator-prey interactions, refuges may also mediate interspecific competition between native and invasive taxa given the role of refuges as a valuable resource. Because interspecific interactions (e.g., competition and predation) can be modulated by temporal and biotic (e.g., trophic level) factors, we used a manipulative approach to investigate community-wide refuge-use patterns in the context of two important ecological factors: invasive species and seasonality. We surveyed refuge (artificial cover object) use of ants and vertebrates in a forest community for 2years, and we systematically suppressed an established invasive species (red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta) to examine its impact on community refuge use. Native Camponotus ants appeared to co-exist and share refuges with S. invicta, but we found evidence for a negative effect of S. invicta on vertebrate refuge use that was also influenced by season. Vertebrates were more abundant under refuges undergoing suppression of S. invicta, and they were less abundant under refuges during the fall (the season characterized by the highest occupancy of refuges by S. invicta). Thus, researchers must continue to examine the entire community and to incorporate the effects of season when assessing the impact of invasive species (e.g., at our site, a survey conducted only in the summer or only on native ants would have indicated a negligible effect of S. invicta on community refuge use).","[Stahlschmidt, Z.

Even though intensive aquaculture production of salmonids in lakes occurs in many locations around the world published studies on the survival and reproductive success of escaped cultured salmonids in freshwater ecosystems are not common. A recent expansion of aquaculture in Chile has led it to become the world's second largest producer of cultured salmonids. 2. We document the recent history of escaped and self-sustaining salmonid populations over a wide spatial scale and a long temporal scale in Chilean Patagonian lakes. Our hypotheses are that salmonid density in lakes will be higher where there is intensive aquaculture, due to greater numbers of potential escapees. Secondly, if non-native salmonids have adverse impacts on native fishes, increases in the abundance of non-native species should be associated with decreases in relative abundance of native species. Finally, if the first two hypotheses are correct we anticipate that diets of salmonids may show evidence of predation on native fishes, diet overlap with native species, and evidence of the influence of feed from aquaculture operations in the diets of salmonids and native fishes. 3. We sampled six lakes with gill nets from 1992 to 2001. Our results show that the relative abundance of free-living salmonids is closely related to the level of fish farming production. Salmonids are the top predators and in lakes with fish farming the main prey item is native fishes. The relative abundance of native fishes has decreased, most likely due to predation by salmonids. 4. Our study contributes to the understanding of the effects of non-native salmonids in oligotrophic lakes, and it provides a starting point to judge the establishment of new fish farming sites in lakes around the world.","[Arismendi, Ivan; Leon-Munoz, Jorge] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias Forest, Escuela Grad, Valdivia, Chile; [Soto, Doris] FAO United Nations, Inland Water Resources & Aquaculture Serv FIRI, Dept Fisheries, Rome, Italy; [Penaluna, Brooke] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Jara, Carlos] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Zool, Fac Ciencias, Valdivia, Chile; [Leal, Carlos] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Acuicultura, Lab Ecol Acuat, Puerto Montt, Chile","Arismendi, I (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias Forest, Escuela Grad, Casilla 567, Valdivia, Chile.",ivan.arismendi@postgrado.uach.cl,"Leon-Munoz, Jorge/K-8132-2014; Arismendi, Ivan/B-3144-2010","Leon-Munoz, Jorge/0000-0002-5625-6721; Arismendi, Ivan/0000-0002-8774-9350",Fondo Nacional de Dessarrollo Regional Government of Lakes District of Chile (FNDR); Chilean Fisheries Research Fund [FIP 2000-24]; Comision Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia of Chile (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); Millennium Nucleus Forest Ecosystem Services (FORECOS) [P04-065-F]; Ministerio de Planificacion of Chile,"We are grateful to Cristian Saldias, Marcelo Vargas, Marco Ruiz, JosE Sanzana, Vanessa Barrera and Jorge Gonzalez for their help with the field work.

A survey of L. americanum populations was conducted throughout Biscayne Bay, Florida, USA. Abundance of the species was highest in the northeastern portion of the Bay and decreased to zero in the southeastern portion. This pattern may be the result of hydrodynamic and salinity regimes that could prevent the recruitment and survival of larvae in the inner portions of the Bay. Abundance of a population of L. americanum at a permanent site within the Bay was monitored for a three-year period, during which gastropod density declined from 26 gastropods m(-2) to zero. The reasons for this population crash are not clear, but may have been caused by high rates of predation and/or intraspecific competition coupled with a lack of recruitment. Growth rates of L. americanum were higher under laboratory conditions (0.46 mm.week(-1)) than in the field (0.25 mm.week(-1)), suggesting that field populations may be food-limited. Growth rate of individuals was also negatively correlated vith size.","Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Ctr Marine & Environm Analyses, Miami, FL 33149 USA","Macia, S (corresponding author), Hofstra Univ, Marine Lab, POB 90, St Anns Bay, Jamaica.",huml@cwjamaica.com,,,,,,23,0,0,0,10,BAILEY-MATTHEWS SHELL MUSEUM,SANIBEL,"C/O DR JOSE H LEAL, ASSOCIATE/MANAGING EDITOR, 3075 SANIBEL-CAPTIVA RD, SANIBEL, FL 33957 USA",0028-1344,,,NAUTILUS,Nautilus,AUG 6,2001,115,2,,,,,62,67,,,,,6,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,466BM,WOS:000170624500005,,,,,2021-09-27,

The importance of recruitment into empty tests varied between B. glandula subpopulations: it was less important on the exposed shores of the Olympic Peninsula and was not found in calmer waters of Puget Sound and the Hood Canal. In the San Juan Archipelago, where B. glandula finds a refuge from predation in the higher intertidal, and at the height at which a maximum of reproductive output is to be expected, much of the subpopulation is derived from recruitment in empty tests. Preferential settlement in scarce empty tests resulted in crowded juveniles on a shore with low overall densities of juveniles.

In the early summer of 2006, we examined vertical gradients of intertidal elevation and horizontal gradients of exposure to wave action and winter ice scour. Recruits were considerably less abundant than adults at all sites, suggesting a high post-recruitment mortality. Although adult barnacles seemed less abundant in areas subjected to strong winter ice scour than in sheltered areas, such a trend lacked statistical support. Adult barnacles were more abundant at high elevations than at low elevations, possibly as a result of vertical differences in the intensity of competition and predation. Size structure was better developed at the high intertidal zone than at the low intertidal zone, with larger organisms occurring at high elevations. In general, it appears as though biotic interactions at the low intertidal zone may play a greater role than abiotic factors at the high intertidal zone in determining the population structure of S. balanoides, although field experimentation will be necessary to confirm this notion.","[Macpherson, Elizabeth A.; Scrosati, Ricardo] St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada","Scrosati, R (corresponding author), St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada.",rscrosat@stfx.ca,"Scrosati, Ricardo A/K-6172-2016","Scrosati, Ricardo A/0000-0002-3050-132X",,,,37,11,11,0,21,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0011-216X,1568-5403,,CRUSTACEANA,Crustaceana,,2008,81,6,,,,,725,736,,10.1163/156854008784513393,,,12,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,320AP,WOS:000257206400007,,,,,2021-09-27,

When making foraging decisions, individuals need to assess the benefits of foraging while accounting for the potential risks of being captured by a predator. However, whether and how different factors interact to shape these decisions is not yet well understood, especially in individual foragers. Here we present a standardized set of manipulative field experiments in the form of foraging assays in the tropical lizard Anolis cristatellus in Puerto Rico. We presented male lizards with foraging opportunities to test how the presence of conspecifics, predation-risk perception, the abundance of food, and interactions among these factors determines the outcome of foraging decisions. In Experiment 1, anoles foraged faster when food was scarce and other conspecifics were present near the feeding tray, while they took longer to feed when food was abundant and when no conspecifics were present. These results suggest that foraging decisions in anoles are the result of a complex process in which individuals assess predation risk by using information from conspecific individuals while taking into account food abundance. In Experiment 2, a simulated increase in predation risk (i.e., distance to the feeding tray) confirmed the relevance of risk perception by showing that the use of available perches is strongly correlated with the latency to feed. We found Puerto Rican crested anoles integrate instantaneous ecological information about food abundance, conspecific activity and predation risk, and adjust their foraging behavior accordingly.","[Drakeley, Maximilian] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Drakeley, Maximilian; Lapiedra, Oriol; Kolbe, Jason J.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","Kolbe, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",jjkolbe@uri.edu,,"Lapiedra, Oriol/0000-0003-0383-0061",University of Manchester Zochonis Travel Award; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1354897]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1354897] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This work was supported by a University of Manchester Zochonis Travel Award to MD and a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant (DEB-1354897) to JJK, which supported OL during the preparation of this manuscript.",,66,16,16,1,30,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,SEP 18,2015,10,9,,,,,,,e0138016,10.1371/journal.pone.0138016,,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CS0ZE,WOS:000361790200048,26384236,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-27,

Additions (thrice weekly) of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus were made to treatment enclosures for the duration of the 10-week experimental period. One-way ANOVA was used to discern treatment effects on the microinvertebrate community at the group level. Impacts of insecticide or inorganic nutrient addition on major groups of microinvertebrates (Cladocera, Cyclopoida and Calanoida Copepoda, Rotifera) were limited, with few significant density changes observed during the experiment. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to analyse the structure of the microinvertebrate community at the species level. Percent cover of enclosure bottom by submersed macrophytes and alkalinity were the only significant environmental variables; 10 environmental variables in the CCA accounted for 90 % of the variance in the microinvertebrate species data. Differential mortality of arthropod microinvertebrates resulted from chlorpyrifos addition; calanoid copepods were more tolerant than cladocerans and cyclopoid copepods. An increase in the proportional abundance of small planktonic rotifers was observed after insecticide treatment, probably due to decreased competition with cladocerans and reduced cyclopoid copepod predation.

However, the forces mediating these positive impacts remain mostly unclear. To identify how water availability impacts plant quality and multi-trophic interactions, we conducted manipulative field studies with two populations of the specialist herbivore Pieris rapae, and its host plant, Rorippa indica. We found that P. rapae larvae experienced higher survival on R. indica growing under low water availability compared with plants grown under high water availability. Higher survival of eggs and larvae was related to the reduced abundance of other herbivores and natural enemies. Water availability had differential impacts on other members of the herbivore community by altering plant quality. Low water availability decreased the quality of R. indica to most herbivores, as indicated by reduced abundance in the field and decreased relative growth rate in laboratory feeding assays. In contrast, P. rapae larval performance was not affected by sympatric R. indica grown under different water availability. These results indicate that local P. rapae populations possess physiological adaptations to overcome fluctuations in host quality. Our findings illustrate that reduced water availability is beneficial to a specialist herbivore but detrimental to most other herbivores. Our work highlights the complex effects of the arthropod communities associated with plants in determining the impacts of water availability on insect herbivores.","[Lin, Po-An; Felton, Gary W.] Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, State Coll, PA 16801 USA; [Liu, Chia-Ming] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ibaraki, Japan; [Ou, Jia-Ang] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Sun, Cheng-Han; Ho, Chuan-Kai] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chuang, Wen-Po] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agron, Taipei, Taiwan; [Kinoshita, Natsuko] Univ Tsukuba, Dept Agrobioresources Sci & Technol, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Ibaraki, Japan","Lin, PA (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, State Coll, PA 16801 USA.",pbl5066@psu.edu; cobras770920@hotmail.com; wou@zoology.ubc.ca; r06b44010@ntu.edu.tw; wenpo@ntu.edu.tw; ckho@ntu.edu.tw; kinoshita.natsuko.gf@u.tsukuba.ac.jp; gwf10@psu.edu,"Lin, PO-AN/AAL-1643-2021",,"International Agriculture and Development Graduate Program (College of Agricultural Sciences, Pennsylvania State University, INTAD competitive grant)","We thank the International Agriculture and Development Graduate Program (College of Agricultural Sciences, Pennsylvania State University, INTAD competitive grant) for providing monetary support and feedback on experimental design.

Thus, there is a need to preserve tidal marshes in the northeastern United States, but to do so requires an understanding of the habitat features that support robust populations. Previous studies have shown Saltmarsh Sparrow abundance increases with marsh size, but in similar bird species, area sensitivity is more directly linked to edge avoidance. Whether additional landscape features affect the abundance of Saltmarsh Sparrows is unknown. We explored how the height of objects on the horizon, an index of habitat openness, affected the abundance of Saltmarsh Sparrows. Our primary goal was to determine whether the angle to the highest point on the horizon (angle to maximum horizon) predicted abundance better than marsh area or distance to the marsh edge. We used N-mixture models to evaluate the combination of spatial factors that best predicted Saltmarsh Sparrow abundance while also accounting for survey-level variables that could influence detection probability. We found that the interaction between distance to edge and angle to maximum horizon best predicted abundance. Taller objects on the horizon were negatively correlated with bird abundance, and this effect was strongest within 50 m of the marsh edge. When we considered the predictive powers of patch area, distance to edge, and angle to maximum horizon individually, angle to maximum horizon was the best single predictor. We found the highest abundance of Saltmarsh Sparrows at point locations where the angle to maximum horizon was 0.0 degrees, and at angles greater than 12 degrees the predicted abundance fell below 1 bird per survey point. We propose that managers should prioritize marsh openness and experimentally test the effect of marsh edge manipulations when making conservation decisions for this rapidly declining species.","[Marshall, Hallie; Blomberg, Erik J.] Univ Maine, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Conservat Biol, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Watson, Valerie; Conway, Meaghan] Univ Maine, Ecol & Environm Sci Program, Orono, ME USA; [Cohen, Jonathan B.; Kocek, Alison R.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Correll, Maureen D.] Bird Conservancy Rockies, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Elphick, Chris S.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT USA; [Hodgman, Thomas P.] Maine Dept Inland Fisheries & Wildlife, Bangor, ME USA; [Kovach, Adrienne, I] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Shriver, W.

In California date gardens, this predator is found in low numbers that are insufficient for the economic suppression of Banks grass mites, and our research aims to understand why it fails to keep up with prey densities. The hypothesis that prey density and predator interference interactively determine the predation efficiency of G. flumenis was tested. In addition, the effect of arena size and prey and predator density manipulations on the emigration rate of the predator was investigated. Our results indicate that the per capita predation rate of G. flumenis decreases steeply with increasing predator density due to mutual interference. Analysis of emigration data considering the arena size and predator numbers showed that the emigration rate of G. flumenis was higher from small arenas, and increased with increasing predator numbers. When emigration data were analyzed using prey and predator densities as independent variables, only the effect of predator density was significant, suggesting that higher predator density increases the emigration rate of G. flumenis. These results contribute to our understanding of the predator-prey interactions, and help in designing strategies for more efficient augmentative releases of G. flumenis.","[Ganjisaffar, Fatemeh; Perring, Thomas M.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, 900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Nachman, Gosta] Univ Copenhagen, Sect Ecol & Evolut, Dept Biol, Univ Pk 15, D-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark","Ganjisaffar, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, 900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",fatemeh.ganjisaffar@email.ucr.edu; gnachman@bio.ku.dk; thomas.perring@ucr.edu,"Ganjisaffar, Fatemeh/I-6895-2016","Ganjisaffar, Fatemeh/0000-0003-1491-8122",California Date Commission; Robert and Peggy van den Bosch Memorial Scholarship,"We thank the many contributions of Albert Keck, Oscar Leal, Darcy Reed, and James Hepler.

Many taxa can be found in food webs that differ in trophic complexity, but it is unclear how trophic complexity affects the performance of particular taxa. In pond food webs, larvae of the salamander Ambystoma opacum occupy the intermediate predator trophic position in a partial intraguild predation (IGP) food web and can function as keystone predators. Larval A. opacum are also found in simpler food webs lacking either top predators or shared prey. 2. We conducted an experiment where a partial IGP food web was simplified, and we measured the growth and survival of larval A. opacum in each set of food webs. Partial IGP food webs that had either a low abundance or high abundance of total prey were also simplified by independently removing top predators and/or shared prey. 3. Removing top predators always increased A. opacum survival, but removal of shared prey had no effect on A. opacum survival, regardless of total prey abundance. 4. Surprisingly, food web simplification had no effect on the growth of A. opacum when present in food webs with a low abundance of prey but had important effects on A. opacum growth in food webs with a high abundance of prey. Simplifying a partial IGP food web with a high abundance of prey reduced A. opacum growth when either top predators or shared prey were removed from the food web and the loss of top predators and shared prey influenced A. opacum growth in a nonadditive fashion. 5. The non-additive response in A. opacum growth appears to be the result of supplemental prey availability augmenting the beneficial effects of top predators. Top predators had a beneficial effect on A. opacum populations by reducing the abundance of A. opacum present and thereby reducing the intensity of intraspecific competition. 6. Our study indicates that the effects of food web simplification on the performance of A. opacum are complex and depend on both how a partial IGP food web is simplified and how abundant prey are in the food web. These findings are important because they demonstrate how trophic complexity can create variation in the performance of intermediate predators that play important roles in temporary pond food webs.","[Davenport, Jon M.] E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; E Carolina Univ, N Carolina Ctr Biodivers, Greenville, NC 27858 USA","Davenport, JM (corresponding author), E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",jondavenport80@gmail.com,,"Chalcraft, David/0000-0002-2165-0948",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0716558],"We would like to thank K.

This paper reports a field factorial experiment on shell-size variation of N. biradiata as a response to two independent factors: intertidal gastropod density and shore height above sea level. Four rocky shores were selected on the Colombian Pacific coast, two in Gorgona Island and two in Utria Cove. The intertidal gastropods density was determined in each rocky shore using the transect-quadrant technique. Significant differences were observed in the gastropod densities between study sites: low density in the rocky shores of Utria Cove and high density in the rocky shores of Gorgona Island (P < 0.009). A factorial sampling was conducted to determine the effect of the density and height on the shore over shell-length, shell-height and shell-thickness. A two-way ANOVA and a least-squared regression was used to determine whether the shell-sizes differ between varying densities and shore heights. Intertidal gastropod density was found to be the dominant factor in determining basal shell length (ANOVA, P < 0.001) and shell height (ANOVA P < 0.05) changes. Thus, at low population densities the shells are larger and taller. The height on the shore did not influence shell-size of N. biradiata (ANOVA, P > 0.30).","Univ Valle, Dept Biol, Secc Biol Marina, Cali, Colombia; Univ Autonoma Occidente, Programa Admon Med Ambiente & Recursos Nat, Cali, Colombia; Univ Concepcion, Dept Oceanog, Concepcion, Chile","Giraldo, A (corresponding author), Univ Valle, Dept Biol, Secc Biol Marina, AA 25360, Cali, Colombia.",agiraldo@biologos.univalle.edu.co,"Giraldo, Alan/K-7794-2019","Giraldo, Alan/0000-0001-9182-888X",,,,43,3,4,0,6,"INST INVESTIGACIONES OCEANOLOGICAS, U A B C",BAJA CALIFORNIA,"APARTADO POSTAL 423, ENSENADA, BAJA CALIFORNIA 22800, MEXICO",0185-3880,,,CIENC MAR,Ceinc.

Field census data and laboratory experiments were used to determine how ovipositing females of the two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata (L.), assess whether an aphid population is suitable for exploitation. In the field, two-spot ladybirds usually laid eggs well before aphid populations peaked in abundance. In the laboratory they showed a marked reduction in their reproductive numerical response in the presence of larvae of their own species but not of other aphidophagous ladybirds. At the highest aphid density this was not a consequence of competition for food between larvae and ovipositing females. In the presence of conspecific larvae gravid females were very active and as a consequence more likely to leave an area, and when confined with other conspecific females or larvae laid fewer eggs and later than females kept on their own. The extent of the inhibition of egg laying is negatively correlated with the rate of encounter with larvae. Thus it is proposed that gravid females appear mainly to use the presence of conspecific larvae to assess the potential of an aphid colony for supporting the development of their offspring.","UNIV E ANGLIA,SCH BIOL SCI,NORWICH NR4 7TJ,NORFOLK,ENGLAND",,,"Hemptinne, Jean-Louis/C-5989-2009","Hemptinne, Jean-Louis/0000-0003-3875-2497",,,,36,139,148,0,20,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,1992,90,2,,,,,238,245,,10.1007/BF00317181,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HU052,WOS:A1992HU05200011,28313719,,,,2021-09-27,

Because pelagic larvae result in an essential decoupling of local reproduction from local larval recruitment, many marine populations should be considered demographically 'open'. Accordingly, factors affecting larval input to the benthos might be especially important in structuring both populations and communities, and even supercede the importance of post-settlement processes such as competition, predation and physical disturbance. Comprehensive studies on intertidal barnacles have provided an initial focus for field studies, but perhaps the greatest challenge facing marine ecologists Lies in extrapolating beyond single-species populations to assess the relative importance of pre- and post-settlement processes for whole assemblages or communities. Amongst rocky intertidal assemblages, larval supply processes do appear especially important in circumstances where recruitment levels are low: at higher recruitment levels, post-settlement processes are prominent. No comprehensive evaluation of the relative importance of pre- and post-settlement processes has been undertaken for soft sediment assemblages, but the prevailing consensus is that hydrodynamic factors, density dependent effects of food availability and post-settlement processes are of prime importance. For epifaunal 'fouling' assemblages, probably both pre- and post-settlement factors are very important, and illustrative data are presented to show that post-recruitment processes may mask even strong larval signals in later assemblage development. Short-term panel data showed that hard substratum epifaunal recruitment levels do not necessarily conform to simple measures of current velocity at a given site: application of a tidal flushing model did, however, assist in explaining the variation in larval recruitment rates in relation to water flux below an arbitrary critical velocity for larval settlement. An indirect means of assessing realized larval dispersal - and hence geographic scale of population 'openness' - is available from analyses of population genetic differentiation. Data are presented for two species of epifaunal molluscs with contrasting larval types. The planktotrophic species conformed to expectations, in showing genetic homogeneity of populations over a 1600 km range, and therefore in displaying large-scale larval dispersal. The pelagic lecithotrophic species, however, revealed population differentiation on very small scales (< 10 km), even in highly dispersive environments with strong tidal currents (up to 3.6 m s(-1)). The deduction is that contrary to actually facilitating dispersal, those pelagic lecithotrophic larvae are behaviourally constrained to minimize larval transport. The consequences of this to general deductions about 'openness' of epifaunal assemblages are discussed, in the knowledge that spatial domination there is attributable largely to three phyla which characteristically reproduce by means of short-term pelagic lecithotrophic larval stages.","Univ St Andrews, Sch Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Gatty Marine Lab, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland","Todd, CD (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Gatty Marine Lab, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland.",cdt@st-and.ac.uk,"Todd, Christopher/D-7528-2013","Todd, Christopher/0000-0003-3489-6004",,,,102,129,130,1,38,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,,1998,375-76,,,,,,1,21,,10.1023/A:1017007527490,,,21,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,137ZZ,WOS:000076948100002,,,,,2021-09-27,

Given their importance, shells are acquired and transferred between crabs through several modalities. We conducted observations and experiments at the Asinara Island (Sardinia, Italy) to investigate the efficacy of the different behavioral tactics adopted by the hermit crab Clibanarius erythropus to acquire shells, such as: (1) locomotion and activity at different tidal phases; (2) attendance at shell-supplying sites (simulated predation sites with five different odors: live and dead gastropods, live and dead crabs, predator); and (3) interactions with conspecifics in aggregations on simulated gastropod predation sites. In each tidal phase, locomotion was slow (0.7 cm min(-1)) and, as a consequence, the probability of encountering empty shells and conspecifics was low. Simulated gastropod predation sites quickly attracted a larger number of hermit crabs than the other sites tested. Aggregations seemed to function as shell exchange markets, as previously suggested for other species: the first attendant took the experimental shell and a chain of shell exchanges among conspecifics followed. Our results show that, in C erythropus, aggregation is the most efficient tactic for the acquisition of new shells, whereas in other species, such as Pagurus longicarpus, it is associated with exploitation ability due to the intense locomotion. The interspecific plasticity in hermit crabs' behavior is confirmed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A two-way factorial design was used, with two productivity levels crossed with the presence/absence of Colpidium striatum. The effects of productivity and predation on bacterial diversity were similar to those previously reported for plant diversity in systems characterized by high productivities, with increased productivity reducing diversity and predation increasing diversity. When Colpidium was present, changes in trophic level biomass and individual bacterial species abundance in response to increased productivity were largely consistent with the keystone predation model. Importantly, Colpidium predation also resulted in an increase in particulate organic matter decomposition, largely due to an increase in the abundance of one single bacterial species that appeared resistant to predation. These results suggest that changes in community structure as a result of trophic interactions and other factors may have profound consequences for important ecosystem functions. We suggest that future research should take an integrative approach and study causes and consequences of biodiversity simultaneously.","Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Jiang, L (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, 31 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",lin.jiang@biology.gatech.edu,"Jiang, Lin/K-5572-2019","Krumins, Jennifer/0000-0002-1231-2453",,,,70,9,9,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,2006,114,3,,,,,441,450,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14961.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,076WH,WOS:000239988300006,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, the effects of social stress on demographic density dependence remain largely overlooked in ecological theory. Here we combine behavioural experiments, physiology and population modelling to show in a top predator (pike Esox lucius) that social stress alone may be a primary driver of demographic density dependence. Doubling pike density in experimental ponds under controlled prey availability did not significantly change prey intake by pike (i.e. did not significantly change interference or exploitative competition), but induced a neuroendocrine stress response reflecting a size-dependent dominance hierarchy, depressed pike energetic status and lowered pike body growth rate by 23 per cent. Assuming fixed size-dependent survival and fecundity functions parameterized for the Windermere (UK) pike population, stress-induced smaller body size shifts age-specific survival rates and lowers age-specific fecundity, which in Leslie matrices projects into reduced population rate of increase (lambda) by 37-56%. Our models also predict that social stress flattens elasticity profiles of lambda to age-specific survival and fecundity, thus making population persistence more dependent on old individuals. Our results suggest that accounting for non-consumptive social stress from competitors and predators is necessary to accurately understand, predict and manage food-web dynamics.","[Edeline, Eric] Univ Paris 06, Ecole Normale Super, UMR CNRS 7618, Lab Biogeochim & Ecol Milieux Continentaux, F-75230 Paris 05, France; [Edeline, Eric; Haugen, Thrond O.; Stenseth, Nils Chr.; Vollestad, L.

Social information relates to the external features of surrounding peers, and little is known about its use by solitary species. Here, we investigated the use of social cues in a solitary marine predator by creating artificial aggregations of free-ranging sicklefin lemon sharks (Negaprion acutidens). Using a novel monitoring protocol, we analysed both dominance interactions and tolerance associations between sharks competing for food in relation with the number, the morphology and the behaviour of rivals. Sharks produced more agonistic displays and spent more time around the bait as competitors were more abundant. Moreover, the morphological attributes of competitors had very limited influence on the structure of shark social interactions. Instead, sharks appeared to establish tolerance relationships with competitors according to their individual behaviour. Furthermore, the more two sharks were observed together at a given study site, the fewer agonistic interactions they exchanged. We discuss these findings as evidence of the use of social cues in a non-gregarious predatory species and suggest directions for future research.","[Brena, Pierpaolo F.; Mourier, Johann; Planes, Serge; Clua, Eric E.] PSL Res Univ EPHE UPVD CNRS, USR CRIOBE 3278, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Mourier, Johann; Planes, Serge; Clua, Eric E.] PSL Res Univ, EPHE, Lab Excellence CORAIL, UPVD,CNRS,USR CRIOBE 3278, Moored, French Polynesi, France","Brena, PF (corresponding author), PSL Res Univ EPHE UPVD CNRS, USR CRIOBE 3278, F-66860 Perpignan, France.",p.brena@live.fr,"Clua, Eric/D-7820-2013; Mourier, Johann/B-4881-2012","Mourier, Johann/0000-0001-9019-1717; CLUA, Eric/0000-0001-7629-2685","Ministere de l'Ecologie, du Developpement Durable et de l'Energie (MEDDE) of France; Fonds Francais pour l'Environnment Mondial (FFEM); Delegation Regionale a la Recherche et a la Technologie (DRRT) of French Polynesia","This study benefited from the financial support of the Ministere de l'Ecologie, du Developpement Durable et de l'Energie (MEDDE) of France, the Fonds Francais pour l'Environnment Mondial (FFEM) and the Delegation Regionale a la Recherche et a la Technologie (DRRT) of French Polynesia.",,72,10,10,1,18,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

In addition, we summarized results from three experimental studies from northern Europe on their density associations. Based on anticipated changes in the relative intensity of positive and competitive interactions we predicted a unimodal density association between Parus and Fringilla: at low and intermediate densities the two groups are positively associated (positive interaction), whereas high densities promote interspecific competition. In central Europe where densities are high, densities were unimodally related to each other. In northern and southern Europe linear and positive associations appeared. Experimental studies provided consistent support for positive interspecific interactions in the north. The results suggest that species interactions may indeed vary in relation to the density of potential competitor and switch from positive to negative along environmental gradients.","Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland","Monkkonen, M (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, POB 3000, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland.",mikko.monkkonen@oulu.fi,"Thomson, Robert L/B-9637-2012; Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012; Monkkonen, Mikko/A-2821-2011","Thomson, Robert L/0000-0002-6958-1259; Monkkonen, Mikko/0000-0001-8897-3314",,,,47,19,19,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,FEB,2004,27,1,,,,,112,118,,10.1111/j.0906-7590.2004.03705.x,,,7,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,775DP,WOS:000189025700011,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

Sustainable alternatives to pesticides are sorely needed inFuscospora(beech) forests. We tested a new semiochemical evaluation protocol to assess the extent of high-density trap competition as an indicator of mass trapping, in an open landscape adjacent to a beech forest near Cass (Canterbury, New Zealand), for potential worker or drone removal. We tested the kairomone lure using a before-after control-impact design at a 1-ha scale with a grid of 25 bucket traps as a high-density trapping treatment (three replicates). The trial was affected by a major inundation event and catches declined steadily in both treatments for the month following, and treatment effects were not significantly different. Drone captures in sticky traps showed a dose response in catch to 1, 3 or 10 gynes (virgin queens). Sticky traps baited with three gynes in a 5 x 5 array over 1 ha (four replicates), caught a mean of 7.39 (+/- 0.88) drones per trap per day across the high density and control traps (n = 116), but there was no difference in the number of drones caught per central trap in the control and treatment plots (n = 4 per plot), demonstrating the limitations of our methods under extreme population pressure in such a mobile species. It is proposed that the gyne sex pheromone be identified and investigated for potential use in area-wide suppression, as it holds more promise as an attractant than the kairomones tested.","[Sullivan, T.

The species is still, however, threatened, and the human population and accompanying domestic livestock are increasing around Qinghai Lake. Here we provide up-to-date information on the distribution and population size of the species, evaluate its current conservation status and discuss the difficulties of protecting this gazelle species. We used both distance sampling and total counts to survey 16 sites where the species has been reported and found it at 13 of these, occupying a total area of c. 250 km(2). Population size estimated from distance sampling (1,635) and total counts (1,544) was similar. About 20% of the gazelles located were in newly discovered areas for the species. The results indicate an overall growth in the population of Przewalski's gazelle since 2003, although some subpopulations have declined or been extirpated. In spite of conservation efforts Przewalski's gazelle is still threatened by habitat degradation and loss, habitat fragmentation, fencing, intensified competition with domestic livestock and predation. Further growth of this gazelle population is constrained by limited habitat availability and human-gazelle conflict. We recommend that management and conservation strategies need to incorporate comprehensive knowledge of the gazelle, long-term monitoring, and captive breeding of injured and orphaned gazelles to form a potential pool of individuals for future reintroductions to the historical range of the species outside the Qinghai Lake basin.","[Li, Chunlin; Jiang, Zhigang; Ping, Xiaoge; Cai, Jing; You, Zhangqiang; Li, Chunwang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yonglin] Adm Qinghai Lake Natl Nat Reserve, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China","Jiang, ZG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jiangzg@ioz.ac.cn,"Jiang, Zhigang/E-4598-2014","Jiang, Zhigang/0000-0003-2154-8588",Administration of Qinghai Lake National Nature Reserve; Wildlife and Nature Reserve Management Bureau of Qinghai Province; MOSTMinistry of Science and Technology (MOST) Korea [2008BAC39B04]; State Forestry Administration; SSC/IUCN,"We appreciate the support of the Administration of Qinghai Lake National Nature Reserve and the Wildlife and Nature Reserve Management Bureau of Qinghai Province.

It was listed as endangered pursuant to the U.S. Endangered Species Conservation Act in 1970 and subsequently the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1973. Field research from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s has documented a rapid population decline. Despite many efforts, researchers have not captured the Morro Bay kangaroo rat since 1986, and the last captive individual died in 1993. We review the biology and conservation status of the Morro Bay kangaroo rat, including taxonomy and genetics, soil type and burrows, history of decline, primary causes of decline, breeding in the wild and in captivity, habitat restoration, and threats. In particular, there are two primary causes of decline. First, development (urban, agricultural, and industrial) has resulted in direct loss of habitat. Second, in the absence of fire, the early seral stages of coastal dune scrub (optimal habitat) have matured to later successional stages of vegetation, which are denser and with substantially fewer annual food plants, and which negatively impact the locomotion of kangaroo rats and change the diversity of the small mammal community with a likely increase in competition. In 2016 only pockets of habitat remain, with optimal habitat comprising an estimated 1% of the historical geographic range. Although researchers have not demonstrated predation by domestic cats, it is likely a major threat and we suspect it has contributed to the decline based upon a review of the literature. In 2011 we observed potential signs of the Morro Bay kangaroo rat at two historical areas, which suggests it may be persisting at extremely low densities in a few isolated colonies. In addition, we could not obtain permission to survey on four private properties with potential habitat. In consideration of the vast loss and fragmentation of its habitat, along with the continuing and pervasive threats, the Morro Bay kangaroo rat is clearly conservation-reliant.

Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the food preferences of ruffe and yellow perch and to compare their feeding rates on two types of substrate (sand and cobble). For comparison with natural communities, we sampled benthic macroinvertebrates from western Lake Michigan and compiled published data on invertebrate community structure from all of the Great Lakes. Ruffe and yellow perch both preferentially consumed soft-bodied taxa (e.g., chironomid midge larvae, mayflies, and non-cased caddisflies) and avoided hard-bodied taxa (e.g., cased caddisflies, snails, and clams) in laboratory studies. Prey preferences of fish in mixed-fish species treatments were more diverse than those in single-fish species treatments. Ruffe and yellow perch of similar sizes consumed approximately 5% of their body mass per 24 hours at 20 degrees C on sand, whereas their feeding rates were reduced by over 50% on cobble, where prey were likely able to escape predation by hiding. Results from our laboratory experiments, field survey, and review of published studies indicate that oligochaetes and chironomids, the two most numerous macroinvertebrate taxa in each of the Great Lakes, are vulnerable to ruffe predation. Less abundant taxa range from vulnerable (amphipods, flatworms, and caddisflies) to invulnerable (sphaeriid clams, gastropods, and zebra mussels). Our study suggests that (I) the composition of benthic macroinvertebrate fauna in each of the Great Lakes is suitable for ruffe, and (2) ruffe and yellow perch will likely prefer similar food resources where they co-occur.","Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; Loyola Univ, Dept Biol, Chicago, IL 60626 USA","Lamberti, GA (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",Lamberti.1@nd.edu,"Lodge, David Michael/AAX-1781-2021","Fullerton, Aimee/0000-0002-5581-3434",,,,30,30,32,0,20,INT ASSOC GREAT LAKES RES,ANN ARBOR,"2200 BONISTEEL BLVD, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109-2099 USA",0380-1330,,,J GREAT LAKES RES,J.

Durophagy, the consumption of hard-shelled prey, is thought to require special adaptations for crushing or digesting the hard shells to avoid the many potential costs of this prey type. But many animals lacking specializations nevertheless include hard-bodied prey in their diets. We describe several non-mutually exclusive adaptive mechanisms that could explain such a pattern, and point to optimal foraging and compensatory growth as potentially having widespread importance in explaining costly-prey consumption. We first conducted a literature survey to quantify the regularity with which non-specialized teleost fishes consume hard-shelled prey: stomach-content data from 325 teleost fish species spanning 82 families (57,233 stomach samples) demonstrated that non-specialized species comprise similar to 75% of the total species exhibiting durophagy, commonly consuming hard-shelled prey at low to moderate levels (similar to 10-40% as much as specialists). We then performed a diet survey to assess the frequency of molluscivory across the native latitudinal range of a small livebearing fish, Gambusia holbrooki, lacking durophagy specializations. Molluscivory was regionally widespread, spanning their entire native latitudinal range (>14 degrees latitude). Third, we tested for a higher frequency of molluscivory under conditions of higher intraspecific resource competition in Bahamian mosquitofish (Gambusia spp.). Examining over 5,300 individuals, we found that molluscivory was more common in populations with higher population density, suggesting that food limitation is important in eliciting molluscivory. Finally, we experimentally tested in G. holbrooki whether molluscivory reduces growth rate and whether compensatory growth follows a period of molluscivory. We found that consumption of hard-shelled gastropods results in significantly reduced growth rate, but compensatory growth following prior snail consumption can quickly mitigate growth costs. Our results suggest that the widespread phenomenon of costly-prey consumption may be partially explained by its relative benefits when few alternative prey options exist, combined with compensatory growth that alleviates temporary costs.","[Langerhans, Randall Brian; Goins, Taylor R.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, WM Keck Ctr Behav Biol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Stemp, Kenzi M.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Riesch, Rudiger] Royal Holloway Univ London, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Behav, Dept Biol Sci, Egham, Surrey, England; [Araujo, Marcio S.] Univ Estadual Paulista UNESP, Inst Biociencias, Rio Claro, Brazil; [Layman, Craig A.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Raleigh, NC USA; [Layman, Craig A.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Ctr Energy Environm & Sustainabil, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA","Langerhans, RB (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, WM Keck Ctr Behav Biol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",langerhans@ncsu.edu,,"Riesch, Rudiger/0000-0002-0223-1254",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0842364]; North Carolina State University,Funding was provided by the National Science Foundation (DEB-0842364) and North Carolina State University.,,91,1,1,4,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

For example, migratory water birds are believed to suffer from competition with resident fish populations for shared food resources. While observational evidence in support of this hypothesis is accumulating, replicated experiments addressing this issue at the proper spatial scale are lacking. Here, we report from a replicated whole-system experiment in which we stocked large (0.07 km(2)), shallow (<= 2.5 m deep), highly eutrophic ponds in the bird protection area Ismaninger Speichersee mit Fischteichen'' with different densities of carp and assessed the responses of water birds and their food resources during summer over several years. In all years, the biomasses of benthic macroinvertebrates, macroalgae, and macrophytes as well as the densities of herbivorous, carnivorous, and omnivorous water birds were reduced in carp ponds compared to fishshless ponds. The negative effects of carp on food resources and on the numbers of water birds feeding in carp ponds increased over the season (May-September) and were stronger at high than at low stocking densities of carp. Consequently, differences in resource densities between ponds with and without carp increased, and the ranking of ponds with respect to resource densities became more predictable over the season. These factors may have contributed to a seasonal improvement of the birds' abilities to track resource densities across ponds, as suggested by tight correlations of bird numbers on ponds with resource densities late, but not early, in the season.","Univ Munich, Dept Biol II, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Haas, K (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Dept Biol II, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.",karin_haas@web.de,"Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013; Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051",,,,58,62,68,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2007,88,11,,,,,2915,2925,,10.1890/06-1981.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,233CL,WOS:000251067900028,18051660,,,,2021-09-27,

We also explain the community composition of ecosystem by basic reproduction numbers. It is shown that the system is globally stable around the interior equilibrium point under certain parametric conditions. Moreover, the system is persistent under some feasible parametric conditions. Our analysis reveals that force of infection and predation rate are the key parameters on the dynamics of the system. Extensive numerical experiments with hypothetical set of parameters are carried out to substantiate our analytical findings. The oscillatory coexistence of the species which is very common in nature is observed for predator disease free system. The introduction of disease in the predator population enhances the extinction of predator population.

This has prompted research into the potential density enhancement of juvenile lobsters with 'casitas', large (1.1 m(2) surface area) but low-lying (3.8 cm entrance height) artificial shelters that exclude large predators. Moray eels (Muraenidae), however, fit into casitas and could therefore pose a threat to lobster enhancement. In a shelter-poor reef lagoon, we examined potential interactions between juvenile lobsters and the locally dominant morays Gymnothorax vicinus and G. moringa in the absence (four 1 ha control sites) and presence of casitas (five 1 ha 'casita sites', each with 10 casitas), before (6 surveys) and after (22 surveys) deployment. Morays and lobsters did not interact as predator-prey, as morays neither consumed nor intimidated co-occurring lobsters. Rather, the 2 taxa appeared to compete for limited shelter on the reef lagoon, as suggested by a significant increase in density and mean size of both taxa on casita sites after deployment. Casitas significantly increased cohabitation of morays and lobsters, yet they tended to co-occur less often than expected by chance, but this result likely reflects behavioral differences between the highly gregarious, more numerous lobsters and the typically solitary, cannibalistic morays. Our study exemplifies the influence of habitat complexity on the nature of interspecific interactions and shows that G. vicinus and G. moringa would not pose a threat to lobster enhancement with casitas.","[Lozano-Alvarez, E.; Briones-Fourzan, P.; Alvarez-Filip, L.; Negrete-Soto, F.; Barradas-Ortiz, C.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Unidad Acad Puerto Morelos, Cancun 77500, Quintana Roo, Mexico; [Weiss, H.

We investigated the role of Ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii) in regulating invertebrate numbers and leaf litter retention in a northern California forest. Our objective was to examine how salamander predation on invertebrates affects leaf litter retention and the amount available for soil-building and carbon capture at the litter-soil interface. We used field enclosures to quantify the effects of Ensatina on invertebrates and litter retention over two wet seasons, using moisture as a covariate. In the first year Ensatina reduced Coleoptera (beetles) and Diptera (flies) larvae >2 mm, adult Coleoptera, Collembola (springtails), and Formicidae (ants), and increased Oribatid mites, larvae <2 mm (Diptera and Coleoptera), Diplopoda (millipedes), and Aranaea (spiders) <2 mm by reducing their competitors and predators. A single Ensatina in a 1.5m(2) enclosure increased litter retention by 13.3% +/- 3.6% (mean +/- SE) compared to controls, facilitating the capture of 200 kg/ha of carbon. At a similar density range-wide this would equate to 72.3 metric tons/yr of carbon in one season potentially sequestered in forest soil rather than entering the atmosphere. In the second year invertebrate densities doubled in response to early rains such that while salamanders reduced the numbers of the same taxa, effect sizes were lower compared to year one, producing biological effects that failed to achieve statistical significance. However, three taxa did significantly increase in year two (Annelida [worms], Psocoptera [barklice], and Chelonethida [pseudoscorpions]). Litter retention in year two was greater on treatment plots by 5.6% +/- 4.6%; however, high variability across plots precluded statistical significance. Ensatina suppressed some invertebrate taxa, released others, increased leaf litter retention, and facilitated greater carbon capture in both years; however, the strength of the effects were modulated by the bottom-up effects of the timing and amount of precipitation in year two.","[Best, Michael L.] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Wildlife, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Welsh, Hartwell H., Jr.] USDA Forest Serv, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, Redwood Sci Lab, Arcata, CA 95521 USA","Best, ML (corresponding author), Humboldt State Univ, Dept Wildlife, Arcata, CA 95521 USA.",hwelsh@fs.fed.us,,,USDA Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Pacific Southwest Research Station; Reptile and Amphibian Conservancy,"This research was conducted in partial fulfillment of the Master's degree program in the Department of Wildlife at Humboldt State University by M.

Ungulate grazing is one such factor, and this study focussed on the effect of sheep (Ovis aries) grazing in a savanna ecosystem on small-mammal community structure. In a landscape-scale assessment, small-mammal community structure was compared at three different levels of grazing on a sheep farm in the Sub-Escarpment Savanna of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. In total, 97 small-mammal individuals across seven species were trapped. Of these individuals, 81.4% were trapped on the no-grazing control, whereas 15.5% and 3.1% were trapped on the medium- and high-grazing treatments, respectively. The results showed that the only significant differences in abundance, diversity, evenness, and richness of small mammals among grazing treatments were those mediated by the effect of grazing on grass height. It is proposed that the reduction in grass height associated with grazing is the primary mechanism by which sheep adversely affect small mammals in this ecosystem. This could be explained by the increased exposure of small mammals to predators after grazing of grass by sheep, and food competition between sheep and small mammals. The data also suggest that small mammals may persist in small and isolated patches of suitable habitat (long grass) within heavily grazed pastures subjected to rotational grazing. In the broader context of community ecology, this study sheds light on cryptic and dynamic interactions between two quite different grazing guilds. Experimental work of this kind may help to determine the role of introduced sheep in biodiversity loss of small mammals across the globe.","[Kuiper, T. R.; Parker, D.

Yet, what maintains species diversity in real ecological communities is still an open question. The non-random structures of ecological interaction networks have been recognized as one key ingredient impacting the maximum number of coexisting species within the ecological community. However most of the earlier theoretical studies have considered communities with only one interaction type (either antagonistic, competitive or mutualistic). Recently, it has been proposed that multiple interaction types might stabilize ecosystems and that, in this hybrid case, increasing complexity increases stability. Here we show that these results depend on ad hoc hypothesis that the authors used in their model and we highlight the need to disentangle the role of multiple interaction types and constant interaction effort allocation on community stability. Indeed, we find that mixing of mutualistic and predator-prey interaction types does not stabilize the community dynamics and we demonstrate that a positive correlation between complexity and stability is observed only if a constant effort allocation is imposed in the ecological interactions. Synthesis In recent years a sparkling research has been devoted to the search of new theoretical mechanisms to explain way ecosystems may persist despite their complexity. Here we show that, contrary to what recently suggested (Mougi et al. 2012), the mismatch between theoretical results and empirical evidences on the stability of ecological community is still there also for communities with both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions, and the 'complexity-stability' paradox is still alive. Indeed, we demonstrate that their results arise as an artifact of the peculiar rescaling of the interaction strengths they imposed. Our study suggests that further theoretical studies and experimental evidences are still needed to better understand the role of interaction strengths in real ecological communities.","[Suweis, Samir; Grilli, Jacopo; Maritan, Amos] Univ Padua, CNISM, Dipto Fis & Astron, IT-35131 Padua, Italy; [Suweis, Samir; Grilli, Jacopo; Maritan, Amos] INFN, IT-35131 Padua, Italy","Suweis, S (corresponding author), Univ Padua, CNISM, Dipto Fis & Astron, Via Marzolo 8, IT-35131 Padua, Italy.",suweis@pd.infn.it,"Grilli, Jacopo/J-1920-2012","Grilli, Jacopo/0000-0002-8235-5803; Suweis, Samir/0000-0002-1603-8375",Cariparo foundationFondazione Cariparo,"We acknowledge Cariparo foundation for financial support, S.

Moreover, consumers should benefit from exploiting the information embedded in environmental features that indicate resource abundance. In desert soils seed abundance associates strong and reliably with vegetation and litter cover at small spatial scales. However, other spatially correlated factors (substrate complexity, temperature, predation risk) may affect foraging costs, benefits and decisions by ground-feeding granivores. We used a sequence of three semi-controlled field experiments of binary spatial choice within a portable aviary to identify the main cause of foraging microhabitat selection by the most abundant postdispersal granivorous bird in the central Monte desert (Argentina). In the first experiment we placed the aviary at field to offer pairs of adjacent microhabitats of unmodified, naturally-contrasting substrates and environmental conditions to single, untrained rufous-collared sparrows Zonotrichia capensis. Birds selected covered microhabitats in winter and summer, ruling out substrate complexity or thermoregulation as main single causes of patch selection. The other two experiments dissociated seed abundance, tree cover and litter to reveal their effects on patch selection. The results indicate that 1) sparrows do not restrict microhabitat exploration relying on environmental indicators, 2) distance to tree cover influences the order of patch exploration, probably in association with apprehension or risk-assessment behavior, and 3) patch exploitation is determined by short-term local estimation of seed abundance. The integration of these with previous results obtained under variable degrees of realism and experimental control allows for a better explanation of the spatial component of postdispersal granivory and its consequences on plants. The unconstrained selective foraging strategy of these sparrows would allow them to detect sporadic or ephemeral rich patches with structural characteristics indicating low-quality', should promote the spatial homogenization of the palatable seed bank, and would favor indirect interactions between plants.","[Milesi, Fernando A.] Univ Buenos Aires, Desert Community Ecol Res Team Ecodes, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Marone, Luis] IADIZA Inst, Desert Community Ecol Res Team Ecodes, Mendoza, Argentina; [Marone, Luis] Univ Nacl Cuyo, Inst Ciencias Basicas, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina","Milesi, FA (corresponding author), CEAN, INIBIOMA UNCo CONICET, Ecodes, Ruta 61,Km 3,8371 Junin Andes, Neuquen, Argentina.",fermilesi@ege.fcen.uba.ar,,"Milesi, Fernando A./0000-0002-7281-1131","FONCyT, ArgentinaFONCyT [PICT 01-12199]; UBACyT, Argentina; CONICET, ArgentinaConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 2012 469]","Thanks to V.

Both systems, the meso-eutrophic (El Padre) and oligotrophic (Minicenote) were considered as monomictic lakes. The abundance, temporal distribution of species, richness and diversity were measured and discussed in relation to the influence of abiotic factors and the presence of a natural predator. These analyses indicated that these tropical systems were not homogenous for several of these measures at both spatial scales and during the annual cycle analyzed, despite their reduced temperature variation compared to temperate lakes. The results indicated that the dynamics in the zooplankton community were related to the environmental factors, the opportunistic species (with maximum densities related to resource maxima), and the exploitative competition between the dominant herbivorous species. Independently of the trophic condition, the abundance, richness, and diversity were lower during the mixing period. During the annual cycle studied in the meso-eutrophic system, the key environmental parameters related to plankton abundance were pH and temperature whereas in the oligotrophic system, oxygen concentration was important. In both lakes, richness and diversity were related to conductivity, although in the oligotrophic lake the relation was negative whereas in the meso-eutrophic lake it was positive. No relationship was found between the abundance of the studied predator (Chaoborus sp.) and the changes in the abundance, diversity and richness of zooplankton in the systems.","[Cervantes-Martinez, Adrian; Gutierrez-Aguirre, Martha A.] Univ Quintana Roo, Dept Ciencias & Humanidades, Cozumel 77642, Quintana Roo, Mexico","Cervantes-Martinez, A (corresponding author), Univ Quintana Roo, Dept Ciencias & Humanidades, Cozumel 77642, Quintana Roo, Mexico.",adcervantes@uqroo.edu.mx,,,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologiaConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); Universidad de Quintana Roo; Cuerpo Academico Vulnerabilidad y Biodiversidad de Sistemas Acuaticos Continentales y Costeros,"The authors would thank Manuel Elias-Gutierrez for his support in the field work.

As a method for reducing the nest predation on ground-nesting birds, we tested whether conditioned food aversion (CFA) can reduce red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) nest predation by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). With a before-after control-impact design we deployed 1329 artificial nests in two different habitats in Central Spain using thiram as an aversive. Artificial nests were monitored by camera traps to identify the red fox individuals during the predation events. 26 foxes were GPS-tagged to monitor their spatial movements and feeding behavior. Partridge density and productivity were monitored to assess the thiram treatment effect on partridge population. Thiram treatment decreased artificial nest predation by foxes in both study sites by 26.8-50.1%, but this was compensated by an increased predation by other predators, possibly enhanced by the availability of our artificial nests. 78% of identified foxes that ingested thiram-treated eggs, stopped nest predation after treatment. Foxes maintained stable territories during the whole study period. Partridge productivity was 132-677% higher in thiram-treatment areas than in control areas, and partridge density after treatment increased more in thiram-treated areas (193-292%) than in control areas (1.8-99%). Our study shows that CFA reduced ground nest predation by foxes, and had a positive effect on the partridge population despite the compensatory predation. This method could be used as a non-lethal tool for conservation of endangered ground-nesting bird species.","[Tobajas, Jorge; Descalzo, Esther; Mateo, Rafael; Ferreras, Pablo] CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC, Ronda Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain","Tobajas, J (corresponding author), CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC, Ronda Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain.",jtobajas47@gmail.com,"Mateo, Rafael/A-3117-2011; Mateo, Rafael/AAU-1480-2020; Ferreras, Pablo/A-6017-2009","Mateo, Rafael/0000-0003-1307-9152; Mateo, Rafael/0000-0003-1307-9152; Ferreras, Pablo/0000-0002-1116-6706; Descalzo, Esther/0000-0002-0809-4422; Tobajas, Jorge/0000-0002-8329-8265","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2013-40975-R, BES-2014-068987]","This study is a result of CGL2013-40975-R project, from I + D + I National Plan funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.

In particular, trait variation among colonizing individuals can produce intraspecific priority effects (IPEs), where early arrivers of a single species affect the establishment or growth of later conspecifics. While we have some evidence for the importance of IPEs, we lack a general understanding of factors affecting their presence or magnitude across a landscape. Specifically, IPEs should depend strongly on success of colonizers in the new habitat patch. This success hinges on interactions between colonizer traits and local selective pressures, but such context dependence remains unexplored experimentally. We addressed this gap by looking for the dynamical signature of IPEs in environments with and without a selective (parasite) pressure. We tested whether IPEs affected the population dynamics of a zooplankton host species (Daphnia dentifera) collected from two populations showing a tradeoff between growth rate and resistance to a fungal parasite (Metschnikowia bicuspidata). Differences in arrival order significantly altered population growth during a period of rapid resource depletion, driving large (up to 65%) differences in population abundance. Furthermore, the presence of IPEs was context dependent, as parasites reduced the impact of early arrivers on later arrivers. Such context-dependent IPEs, mediated by colonizer traits, colonization order, and selective pressures, may play an unanticipated role in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of natural metapopulations. This mechanism highlights the overall importance of intraspecific variation for understanding ecological patterns.","[Dibble, Christopher J.; Rudolf, Volker H.

Landscapes in nature can be viewed as a continuum of small total habitable area with high fragmentation to widely spreading habitats. The dispersal-mediated rescue effect predominates in the former landscapes, while classical density-dependent processes generally prevail in widely spread habitats. A similar principle should be applied to populations of organisms utilizing microhabitats in limited supply. 2. To test this hypothesis, we examined the population dynamics of a web spider, Neriene brongersmai, in 16 populations with varying degrees of microhabitat availability, and we explored whether: (i) high microhabitat availability improves survival rate during density-independent movement, while the resultant high density reduces survival rate in a densitydependent manner; and (ii) temporal population stability increases with microhabitat availability at the population level. Furthermore, we conducted two types of field experiments to verify whether high microhabitat availability actually reduces mortality associated with website movement. 3. Field observations revealed that demographic change in N. brongersmai populations was affected by three factors at different stages, namely the microhabitat limitation from the early to late juvenile stages, the density dependence from the late juvenile to adult stages and the food limitation from the adult to the next early juvenile stages. In addition, there was a tendency for a positive association between population stability and microhabitat availability at the population level. 4. A small-scale experiment, where the frequency of spider web relocation was equalized artificially, revealed that high microhabitat availability elevated the survival rate during a movement event between web-sites. The larger spatiotemporal scale experiment also revealed an improved spider survival rate following treatment with high microhabitat availability, even though spider density was kept at a relatively low level. 5. The population dynamics of N. brongersmai can be determined primarily by density-independent processes based on web-site fragmentation and density-dependent processes driven by interference competition. We conclude that depending on the amount of habitat resources, the relative importance of the two contrasting paradigms-equilibrium and non-equilibrium-appears to vary, even within a particular system.","[Takada, Mayura B.] Univ Tokyo, Sch Agr & Life Sci, Inst Sustainable Agroecosyst Serv, Tokyo 1880002, Japan; [Miyashita, Tadashi] Univ Tokyo, Sch Agr & Life Sci, Lab Biodivers Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Takada, MB (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Sch Agr & Life Sci, Inst Sustainable Agroecosyst Serv, Tokyo 1880002, Japan.",mayura@isas.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"TAKADA, Mayura/0000-0002-4016-550X",,,,70,5,6,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Effectiveness remains largely uninvestigated due to the complexity of its measurement. We measured the effectiveness of seed dispersers (Larus michahellis, Turdus merula, and Oryctolagus cuniculus) of the shrub Corema album (Empetraceae) using a simulation model of the recruitment process that was parameterized with field data of seed dispersal, predation, and seedling emergence and validated with independent data on seedling density. The model allows tracking the fate of seeds dispersed by each animal and estimating, for the first time, disperser effectiveness as seedlings per square meter contributed by each disperser. It also allows quantifying the relative importance of different recruitment processes in determining the quantity and spatial distribution of recruitment. Larus michahellis was the most effective disperser in two of the three habitats studied, contributing 3-125 times more than the other two species, whose lower effectiveness depended mostly on deposition patterns (T. merula) or deleterious effects on seedling emergence (O. cuniculus). The dependence of the plant on each disperser differed between habitats and was the greatest in sparse scrub, where recruitment depended almost exclusively on gulls (90%). Quantity and quality of dispersal were not correlated; quality was a better predictor of disperser effectiveness. Seedling emergence was the most crucial process in determining both the spatial pattern of recruitment among microhabitats (99.8% of variance explained) and the quantity of recruitment within microhabitats (43-83%). A sensitivity analysis showed that increasing seed dispersal improved the recruitment for all dispersers when there was no competition for fruits. However, with limited fruits, increased dispersal of lower quality dispersers reduced overall recruitment. Our results show important differences in effectiveness among dispersers and illustrate the different influences of the components of effectiveness, which varied depending not only on the disperser but also on the circumstances (e. g., type of habitat).","[Calvino-Cancela, Maria] Univ Vigo, Dept Ecol & Anim Biol, EUET Forestal, E-36005 Pontevedra, Spain; [Martin-Herrero, Julio] Univ Vigo, Dept Signal Theory & Commun, ETSET, E-36310 Vigo, Spain","Calvino-Cancela, M (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Dept Ecol & Anim Biol, EUET Forestal, Campus Univ, E-36005 Pontevedra, Spain.",maria@uvigo.es,"Martin-Herrero, Julio/D-3827-2009; Calvino-Cancela, Maria/A-8460-2014","Calvino-Cancela, Maria/0000-0002-7833-4671",Secretaria Xeral de I+D (Xunta de Galicia)Xunta de Galicia [PGIDT01MAM37101PR],"We thank E.

Galls were more abundant in shade than sun across sites. This finding is consistent with the Sink Competition Hypothesis, which predicts higher gall loads on plants with longer internodes (as those in shade) and hence less competition among sinks. Galled leaves were smaller and senesced more rapidly, and galled shoots grew less. In the sun, galled branches produced fewer flowers, but there was ultimately no relationship between gall load and seed production in the year sampled. Gall load was not correlated with seed predation in sun or shade, suggesting no indirect interactions between herbivores. This work suggests that gall insects negatively affect plant growth and reproduction, but manipulative experiments must be conducted to confirm this. Additionally, this study suggests that relationships between leaf gall load and plant fitness traits may not be clearly regulated by the availability of sunlight resources to the plant.","Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA","Leege, LM (corresponding author), Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, POB 8042, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA.",leege@GeorgiaSouthern.edu,,,,,,46,10,10,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,,,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,JUN,2006,184,2,,,,,203,212,,10.1007/s11258-005-9065-4,,,10,Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry,Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,059PY,WOS:000238745900002,,,,,2021-09-27,

Fish were collected above and below manmade instream barriers using multi-meshed gill net fleets, 12 mm mesh fyke nets and 1 mm mesh fyke nets. Sampling was undertaken twice in the winter and twice in the summer of 2009. Of the 2 764 fish caught, marine-spawned species contributed 42.3%. Freshwater mullet Myxus capensis and Cape moony Monodactylus falciformis were the dominant marine-spawned species at most sites and were capable of surmounting almost all instream barriers. The longitudinal distribution of these species did, however, vary by size class, with the largest individuals being recorded the furthest upstream. The longfin eel Anguilla mossambica was the only species sampled above all instream barriers, including the 4 m high Cleveland Weir. The giant mottled eel Anguilla marmorata was found in low numbers at sites closer to the estuary headwaters. Other marine-spawned species, including Liza tricuspidens and Mugil cephalus (Mugilidae), Argyrosomus japonicus (Sciaenidae), Lithognathus lithognathus and Rhabdosargus holubi (Sparidae), were sampled in low numbers from the site directly below the first instream barrier only, suggesting that this first barrier restricted the access of these species to upstream environments. Freshwater non-native fishes contributed 41.7% to the total catch by numbers. The potential impact of the non-native species as predators and competitors on marine-spawned species in the study area is discussed.","[Weyl, O. L.

We herein focused on plantmediated effects that could result from plant defence activation or quality alteration and compared the performance of an omnivore, the western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis, and a pure herbivore, the greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum, on cucumber plants previously infested with either species. Furthermore, we recorded their behavioural responses when given a choice among infested and clean plants. Whiteflies laid less eggs on plants previously exposed to thrips but more on whiteflyinfested plants. Thrips survival was negatively affected on whitefly-infested than on thrips-infested or clean plants. Notably, whiteflies developed significantly faster on plants infested with conspecifics. In accordance, whiteflies avoided thrips-infested plants and preferred whitefly-infested over clean plants. Thrips showed no preference for either infested or clean plants.

In the early-breeding marbled salamander, Ambystoma opacum timing of pond filling may determine whether interactions among larvae are competitive or predatory. The objectives of our studies were to determine how time of egg hatching affected size, larval period, and survival to metamorphosis in A. opacum, and if early hatching in A. opacum influenced the competitive and predator-prey relationships with smaller larvae of the mole salamander, Ambystoma talpoideum. Salamander larvae were reared from hatching through metamorphosis in large, outdoor enclosures located in a natural temporary pond in Aiken County, South Carolina, in two experiments. In study 1, we reared early- and late-hatching A. opacum larvae separately from hatching through metamorphosis. In study 2, we examined how early- versus late-hatching A. opacum affected a syntopic species, A. talpoideum. In general, early-hatching A. opacum were larger and older at metamorphosis, had greater survival, and left the pond earlier than late-hatching larvae. Ambystoma talpoideum reared in the presence of early-hatching A. opacum had lower survival than in controls, suggesting that A. apacum may predate upon A. talpoideum when they gain a growth advantage over later-hatching larvae. Our studies demonstrate that time of pond filling and phenology of breeding may influence population dynamics and alter the nature of relationships that develop among species.","USGS, Columbia Environm Res Ctr, Columbia, MO 65201 USA; Savannah River Ecol Lab, Aiken, SC 29802 USA; Univ Akron, Dept Biol, Akron, OH 44325 USA","Boone, MD (corresponding author), USGS, Columbia Environm Res Ctr, 4200 New Haven Rd, Columbia, MO 65201 USA.",,"Scott, David/V-7683-2019","Scott, David/0000-0003-2937-0593",,,,30,34,36,0,20,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS HERPETOLOGISTS,CHARLESTON,"UNIV CHARLESTON, GRICE MARINE LABORATORY, 205 FORT JOHNSON RD, CHARLESTON, SC 29412 USA",0045-8511,,,COPEIA,Copeia,MAY 21,2002,,2,,,,,511,517,,10.1643/0045-8511(2002)002[0511:EOHTFL]2.0.CO;2,,,7,Zoology,Zoology,555AU,WOS:000175771000029,,,,,2021-09-27,

Three teleost fish which feed on benthic molluscs, Lethrinus nebulosus, Diagramma pictum and Pseudocaranx dentex, were common in the vicinity of the cages. Surveys of feeding scars in the sand indicated similar use of cage control and open control plots and effective exclusion by cages. The densities of 10 common species of prey were variable between locations and among times. Only 2 species exhibited an effect attributable to feeding by fish, and this was at one location only. The effect size was small relative to the spatial and temporal variation in numbers. The power of the test was sufficient to detect effects of fish on most species, had they occurred. A number of the molluscs exhibited annual cycles in abundance, with summer peaks due to an influx of juveniles but almost total loss of this cohort in winter. There was no evidence that predation altered the size-structure of these populations. While predation by fish is clearly intense, it does not have significant effects on the demography of these molluscs. The results cast doubt on the generality of the claim that predation is an important structuring agent in tropical communities.","UNIV SYDNEY, SCH BIOL SCI, SYDNEY, NSW 2006, AUSTRALIA",,,"Jones, Geoffrey P./E-9306-2010; Sale, Peter/AAM-5414-2020","Jones, Geoffrey P./0000-0002-6244-1245; ",,,,55,14,14,0,12,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Cannibalistic specialization in H. retardatus appears to a lesser degree than in those species that have clearly dimorphic morphs. To examine the degree of cannibalistic specialization and intraspecific phenotypic variation, we investigated the allometric relationship between the head and body in the larvae of H. retardatus in a single pond. In addition, the effect of cannibalism on the determination of morphology was examined. A field survey revealed the existence of allometric dimorphism and the occurrence of large-headed large larvae. However, we did not observe a bimodal size distribution that indicates a split in the population. A laboratory experiment revealed that the development of such large-headed large larvae was inducible by actual cannibalism and/or additional tactile cues under high-density conditions. We deduce that the allometric dimorphism in the larvae of H. retardatus in the wild is caused by actual cannibalism. The cannibalistic phenotypic variation in H. retardatus would be characterized by allometric dimorphism without a bimodal size-frequency distribution.","Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Dept Systemat & Ecol, Lab Anim Ecol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan","Okada, Y (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Earth Sci, Lab Ecol & Genet, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan.",yasukazu@ees.hokudai.ac.jp,,,,,,27,0,0,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0394-9370,1828-7131,,ETHOL ECOL EVOL,Ethol.

Loss of sea ice habitat for ice-dependent species such as polar bears (Ursus maritimus) has been associated with declines in body condition, reproductive output, survival, and abundance. Monitoring habitat use can therefore provide insights into population responses to sea ice loss, especially for vulnerable demographic groups such as subadults. Here, we used resource selection functions to examine habitat selection patterns of subadult male and female (n = 21) and adult female (n = 37) polar bears in the Southern Beaufort Sea population from 2007 to 2011. We found that polar bears displayed broad similarities in seasonal habitat selection by using nearshore areas in winter/spring and ranging farther offshore into the multiyear ice in summer/autumn. However, there were differences in habitat use among age, sex, and reproductive classes. Adult females with cubs-of-the-year differed the most among classes and selected landfast ice in spring, allowing them to hunt for seal birth lairs while reducing risk of intra-specific predation. Adult females with older cubs and solitary adult females used active sea ice, which allowed them to hunt adult seals, while subadult females used a mix of active and landfast ice. Subadult males had similar selection for landfast ice as females with cubs-of-the-year, potentially as a mechanism to reduce intra-specific competition and/or kleptoparasitism. The Arctic faces continued warming and understanding variation in habitat use patterns can assist in identifying which bears are most vulnerable to loss of different sea ice habitats.","[Johnson, Amy C.; Derocher, Andrew E.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","Johnson, AC (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",acj1@ualberta.ca,"Derocher, Andrew/J-4469-2012","Derocher, Andrew/0000-0002-1104-7774; Johnson, Amy/0000-0002-3605-441X",Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums; Canadian Wildlife Federation; Environment and Climate Change Canada; Hauser Bears; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Polar Bears International; Polar Continental Shelf ProjectNatural Resources Canada; Quark Expeditions; United States Department of the Interior (Bureau of Ocean Energy Management); World Wildlife Fund Canada,"We would like to thank Jodie Pongracz and Charlene Nielsen for assistance with data extraction and Nicholas Pilfold for constructive comments on modeling.

Density variation of six species was studied during two consecutive breeding seasons. Vegetation structure in wooded streets was significantly less complex than in urban parks, supporting the view that wooded streets were less suitable for breeding birds. Five species (Coal Tit Parus ater, Spotless Starling Sturnus unicolor, Serin Serinus serinus, Black-billed Magpie Pica pica and Woodpigeon Columba palumbus) showed density-dependent habitat occupation of wooded streets, while the Common Blackbird Turdus merula did not. As park suitability decreased with rising densities, wooded streets became a profitable alternative in terms of foraging, breeding, or for moving between parks. However, the relationships varied both between and within species in different years. Such differences could have been caused by variable rates of human disturbance, renewal of resources and predation risks in wooded streets. More detailed studies are required to determine how birds perceive and regulate their population dynamics in fragments and associated corridors, particularly for species targeted for management.","Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim 1, E-28040 Madrid, Spain","Fernandez-Juricic, E (corresponding author), Care of Kacelnik A, Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",estebannfj@yahoo.com,,,,,,42,21,21,2,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0019-1019,1474-919X,,IBIS,Ibis,APR,2001,143,2,,,,,278,287,,10.1111/j.1474-919X.2001.tb04484.x,,,10,Ornithology,Zoology,412VL,WOS:000167575000010,,,,,2021-09-27,

The bioassay depends on assuming that natural selection has fitted the gerbils to assess the comparative values of feeding opportunities and competitive pressures, although these occur in different currencies. The gerbils perform quantitatively and consistently, smoothly adjusting their foraging effort to the combination of disparate opportunities and costs. Measuring their responses as behaviour allowed us to estimate the costs of competition in the currency of energy flow, that is, the rate at which we experimentally add seeds to subplots.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Abramsky, Z (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",zvika@bgumail.bgu.ac.il,"ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012",,,,,42,14,14,0,8,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,1937-3791,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

We characterised patterns of sheltering behaviour in the California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus (Randall)) on southern California rocky reefs and used manipulative experiments to examine how these behaviours affect the survival of subadult lobsters and shelter selection. Lobsters generally were gregarious and subadults were commonly found inhabiting shelters with adult lobsters. Tethering experiments with subadults indicated that communal denning increases the odds of survival only when adult lobsters are part of aggregations. This corresponded to results from a shelter choice experiment in the laboratory, where the presence of predators caused subadults to shelter more often with adult conspecifics rather than other subadults. Despite the gregarious nature of P. interruptus, solitary subadults were common at all sites. Although field experiments clearly indicated that solitary lobsters increased their odds of survival by inhabiting shelters scaled to body size, evidence that lobsters exhibit shelter scaling on natural reefs was mixed. Our results indicate that subadult P. interruptus exhibit similar behavioural strategies as other spiny lobsters to reduce predation risk, and they provide a more comprehensive examination of P. interruptus behaviour than previously available.","[Harrington, Amalia M.; Hovel, Kevin A.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Harrington, Amalia M.; Hovel, Kevin A.] San Diego State Univ, Coastal & Marine Inst, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA","Harrington, AM (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.; Harrington, AM (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Coastal & Marine Inst, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",amaliaharrington@gmail.com,,"Harrington, Amalia/0000-0002-5893-811X","California's MPA Monitoring Enterprise; California State University (CSU) Council on Ocean Affairs, Science and Technology (COAST) Graduate Student Award for Marine Science Research","This study was supported by funding from California's MPA Monitoring Enterprise (by a California Sea Grant) to KAH, and by a California State University (CSU) Council on Ocean Affairs, Science and Technology (COAST) Graduate Student Award for Marine Science Research to AMH.

The model predicts a negative relationship between seed mass and plant abundance among co-existing species in a community. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that rodent granivory affects the slope of this relationship, causing it to become less negative when granivore pressure is reduced because rodents selectively harvest large seeds. Location: Chihuahuan Desert, USA. Methods: We analysed long-term data from an annual plant community in southeast Arizona to characterize the relationship between seed mass and mean plant abundance in three types of plots thatmanipulated the rodent community. Some plots excluded all rodents, other selectively excluded only large-bodied kangaroo rats (Dipodomys), while control plots allowed access by all rodents. Results: We observed negative relationships between seed mass and plant abundance on 23 of the 24 experimental plots. The slopes of these relationships were significantly affected by the experimental treatments. Slopes were most negative for control plots and least negative for plots that excluded all rodents. Conclusion: Rodent granivore exclusion caused the slope of the relationship between seed mass and plant abundance to become less negative. These results illustrate how granivory can affect seed mass-plant abundance relationships, and may provide further insight into the co-existence of plants that vary in seed size.","[Chen, Ting C.; Valone, Thomas J.] St Louis Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63103 USA","Valone, TJ (corresponding author), St Louis Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63103 USA.",chentc@slu.edu; valone@slu.edu,,,College of Arts and Sciences at Saint Louis University,"We thank all those who helped collect the Portal plant data, especially Q.

In both experiments, catfish significantly reduced crayfish survival. Shelter significantly reduced catfish predation on the smaller, but not the larger, crayfish species. Comparisons between experiments showed that in tanks containing catfish, P. hayi had higher survival than O. chickasawae. In both experiments, the mean size of crayfish increased less in the presence than in the absence of catfish, and I argue that the effect is due largely to a reduction in crayfish growth. Channel catfish directly and indirectly influenced crayfish in experimental settings, with the degree of influence varying by crayfish species and presumably related to crayfish size. Thus, fish predation and shelter availability are likely important factors influencing densities of and macrohabitat use by these native crayfishes.","USDA, Forest Serv, So Res Stn, Oxford, MS 38655 USA","Adams, SB (corresponding author), USDA, Forest Serv, So Res Stn, 1000 Front St, Oxford, MS 38655 USA.",sadams01@fs.fed.us,"Adams, Susan B./C-3559-2008",,,,,24,12,13,0,15,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0003-0031,1938-4238,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

Studies assessing the role of invertebrate abundance and behavior as controls on food web structure are rare at the whole ecosystem scale. Here we use a comparative approach to investigate bottomup and topdown influences on whole anchialine pond ecosystems in coastal Hawaii. In these ponds, a single species of endemic atyid shrimp (Halocaridina rubra) is believed to structure epilithon communities. Many Hawaiian anchialine ponds and their endemic fauna, however, have been greatly altered by bottomup (increased nutrient enrichment) and topdown (introduced fish predators) disturbances from human development. We present the results of a survey of dissolved nutrient concentrations, epilithon biomass and composition, and H. rubra abundance and behavior in anchialine ponds with and without invasive predatory fish along a nutrient concentration gradient on the North Kona coast of Hawaii. We use linear models to assess 1) the effects of nutrient loading and fish introductions on pond food web structure and 2) the role of shrimp density and behavior in effecting that change. We find evidence for bottomup food web control, in that nutrients were associated with increased epilithon biomass, autotrophy and nutrient content as well as increased abundance and size of H. rubra. We also find evidence for topdown control, as ponds with invasive predatory fish had higher epilithon biomass, productivity, and nutrient content. Topdown effects were transmitted by both altered H. rubra abundance, which changed the biomass of epilithon, and H. rubra behavior, which changed the composition of the epilithon. Our study extends experimental findings on bottomup and topdown control to the whole ecosystem scale and finds evidence for qualitatively different effects of trait- and density-mediated change in topdown influences.","[Dalton, C.

The effects of algal cover on recruitment may be a key component in these patterns, as upright octocoral recruits may escape competition with algae by growing above the ubiquitous algal turfs. We used laboratory and field recruitment experiments to examine impacts of algal turf on recruitment of the common, upright, and zooxanthellate Caribbean octocoral Plexaura homomalla. Laboratory recruitment rate was significantly higher in lower turf cover treatments. The survival of recruits in the field was significantly reduced by increased turf cover; for every 1% increase in turf cover, polyps died 1.3% faster. In a model parameterized by the observed field survival, polyps exposed to 100% turf cover had a 2% survival rate over 51 days, while polyps exposed to no turf cover had a 32% survival rate over the same time. We found that high densities of turf algae can significantly inhibit recruitment of octocorals. Experimentally obtained octocoral survival rates were higher than those published for Caribbean octocorals. The factors that influence recruitment are critical in understanding the dynamics of octocorals on Caribbean reefs as continuing declines in scleractinian cover may lead to more octocoral-dominated communities.","[Wells, Christopher D.; Tonra, Kaitlyn J.; Lasker, Howard R.] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Geol, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA; [Martinez-Quintana, Angela; Lasker, Howard R.] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Environm & Sustainabil, Buffalo, NY USA; [Tonra, Kaitlyn J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Wells, CD (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Dept Geol, Buffalo, NY 14222 USA.",christopher.wells.23@gmail.com,,"Wells, Christopher D./0000-0002-5945-6171",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 17-56381],"This work was completed under permits from the Virgin Islands National Park (VIIS-2019-SCI-0011) and the Virgin Islands Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW19010) and was funded by the National Science Foundation (OCE 17-56381).

We conducted six field, growth chamber, and veranda experiments to investigate the effects of seed source, physical or chemical presence of co-occurring species, and litter presence on germination percentages of the Florida scrub endemic Liatris ohlingerae. This perennial herb produces many seeds but recruits few seedlings. Germination percentages were similar when seeds from scrub and roadside habitats were sown into their own and the contrasting habitat. We found no evidence of chemical inhibition from a co-occurring terrestrial lichen or from the allelopathic Florida rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides), the dominant shrub in the habitat preferred by L. ohlingerae. However, germination was higher in shallow than in deep litter, and was suppressed by litter from oaks and pines compared to litter from Florida rosemary. In one experiment, higher levels of post-sowing seed predation closer to Florida rosemary shrubs limited germination. Germination of intact G. ohlingerae seeds generally exceeded 60% under a range of field and lab conditions. High field germination percentages within a few weeks of sowing suggest that l.. ohlingerae does not maintain a sizeable persistent seed bank. Low seedling recruitment in this endangered plant is not likely caused by poor seed germination.","[Weekley, Carl W.; Menges, Eric S.] Archbold Biol Stn, Lake Placid, FL 33862 USA; [Tucker, Josephine] Overseas Dev Inst, London SE1 7JD, England; [Valligny, Stephanie] Phylon Biotech Inc, E Windsor, NJ 08520 USA","Weekley, CW (corresponding author), Archbold Biol Stn, POB 2057, Lake Placid, FL 33862 USA.",cweekley@archbold-station.org,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0233899]; Threatened and Endangered Plant Conservation Grants Program of the Florida Division of Plant Industry; Archbold Biological Station,"This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (DEB-0233899), Threatened and Endangered Plant Conservation Grants Program of the Florida Division of Plant Industry, and by Archbold Biological Station.

The strong effects of predators are often attributed to their high trophic position in the food web. However, most predators have to grow and move up the food chain before reaching their final trophic position, and during this developmental process their traits, interactions and abundances change. Here, we show that this process of 'moving up' the food chain during development strongly determines the ecological role of a predator. By experimentally manipulating the succession of developmental stages of a predatory salamander in a seasonal aquatic ecosystem, we found that the effects of this apex predator on the ecosystem typically declined with age and size. Furthermore, younger, smaller predator stages had long-lasting effects on community structure and ecosystem function that determined the effects of subsequent older, larger stages. Consequently, the legacy effects of early stages largely shaped the impact of the predator on the ecosystem, which could not simply be inferred from its final trophic position. Our results highlight that accounting for all life stages when managing natural populations is crucial to preserve the functioning of natural ecosystems, especially given that early life stages of species are often particularly vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic disturbances.","[Rudolf, Volker H.

Size variation within species by necessity implies that ecological interactions vary both in intensity and type over the life cycle of an individual. Physiologically structured population models (PSPMs) constitute a modelling approach especially designed to analyse these size-dependent interactions as they explicitly link individual level processes such as consumption and growth to population dynamics. We discuss two cases where PSPMs have been used to analyse the dynamics of size-structured populations. In the first case, a model of a size-structured consumer population feeding on a non-structured prey was successful in predicting both qualitative (mechanisms) and quantitative (individual growth. survival, cycle amplitude) aspects of the population dynamics of a planktivorous fish population. We conclude that single generation cycles as a result of intercohort competition is a general outcome of size-structured consumer-resource interactions. In the second case, involving both cohort competition and cannibalism, we show that PSPMs may predict double asymptotic growth trajectories with individuals ending up as giants. These growth trajectories. which have also been observed in field data, could not be predicted from individual level information, but are emergent properties of the population feedback on individual processes. In contrast to the size-structured consumer-resource model, the dynamics in this case cannot be reduced to simpler lumped stage-based models, but can only be analysed within the domain of PSPMs. Parameter values used in PSPMs adhere to the individual level and are derived independently from the system at focus, whereas model predictions involve both population level processes and individual level processes under conditions of population feedback. This leads to an increased ability to test model predictions but also to a larger set of variables that is predicted at both the individual and population level. The results turn out to be relatively robust to specific model assumptions and thus render a higher degree of generality than purely individual-based models. At the same time. PSPMs offer a much higher degree of realism, precision and testing ability than lumped stage-based or non-structured models. The results of our analyses so far suggest that also in more complex species configurations only a limited set of mechanisms determines the dynamics of PSPMs. We therefore conclude that there is a high potential for developing an individual-based, size-dependent community theory using PSPMs.","Univ Amsterdam, Populat Biol Sect, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands; Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden","De Roos, AM (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Populat Biol Sect, Kruislaan 320, NL-1098 SM Amsterdam, Netherlands.",aroos@science.uva.nl,"De Roos, Andre M./A-1590-2008; Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012","De Roos, Andre M./0000-0002-6944-2048; ",,,,93,94,97,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2001,94,1,,,,,51,71,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.11313.x,,,21,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,463NE,WOS:000170481600006,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, the general importance of such predator-prey interactions is not yet established. The impact of bird predation on macro-arthropods living in canopies of birch (Betula pendula) and oak (Quercus robur) was studied at six sites in four city parks in Goteborg, southwestern Sweden. In a 17-week field experiment we manipulated the bird-predation pressure on arthropods on birch and oak branches. Passerine numbers differed significantly between birch sites but not between oak sites. Bird predation significantly reduced the abundance on both birch and oak branches of seven out of nine arthropod taxa examined: Araneae, Opiliones, Dermaptera, Psocoptera, Heteroptera (oak only), Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera (birch only). For birch, arthropods were of larger average body size on experimental than on control branches at two sites. At the third site, however, arthropods were larger on control branches. For oak, arthropods were significantly larger on experimental than on control branches at two sites. At the remaining site, in the same park as the deviating birch site, there was no difference between size distributions. Thus, in one of the parks, experimental effects on size distributions at birch and oak sites contradicted the results from the other parks. Site effects on arthropod abundance were found for three insect taxa on birch and one insect taxon on oak. There were significant interactions between experimental treatment and site for Dermaptera on birch and for Araneae on oak. Although one of the parks (the central one) differed from the others in certain aspects, the results suggest that overall, bird predation was not seriously affected by the urban environment. We conclude that bird predation on arthropods is an important link in canopy food webs of temperate-zone forests.","Univ Gothenburg, Dept Zool, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Conservat Biol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden","Gunnarsson, B (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Zool, Box 463, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",Bengt.Gunnarsson@miljo.gu.se,,,,,,36,24,25,0,15,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Changes in capture frequency and the feeding pattern observed in young roach (Rutilus rutilus) feeding alone and in a group of three on a high density prey (Daphnia), in the presence and in the absence of predator odor, were used to determine which of these two alternate explanations is more likely. Earlier studies revealed that a foraging roach captures Daphnia prey in uninterrupted sequences of captures occurring every 1-3 s. Such multiple captures are separated by intermissions of 10-20 s, with their duration being likely to determine the overall capture rate. An experiment was performed to examine whether feeding in a group of three permits higher capture rates (hypothesis 1), and whether the intermittent foraging pattern is due to the need to invest more time for vigilance when foraging alone (hypothesis 2). Video recordings were made of many series of subsequent prey captures by roach feeding on high Daphnia densities, alone or in a group, and in the presence or absence of predator odor. Analysis of these data revealed that the mean duration of intermissions between bursts of feeding activity was significantly greater in the presence of predator odor, which resulted in a significant decrease in the capture rate. Furthermore, when the roach were feeding in a group, these intermissions were reduced to a greater extent in the presence of predator odor than in its absence, implying that the intermission intervals represent an investment for vigilance as an effective antipredation defense that permits increased food intake regardless of whether or not it is enhanced by the resource or the interference competition.","[Bartosiewicz, Maciej; Gliwicz, Z.

In a field experiment, the same number of mussels was relayed on four different areas within plots of the same size, resulting in four treatments with different mussel densities. Density, individual weight and spatial structure of mussels were followed per treatment. The uniformly placed mussels on different areas redistributed into new patches, but mussels did not spread out over a larger area. Initial mussel density affected redistribution and mussel survival. At high densities mussels redistributed into a uniform matrix or in a few larger patches, that showed larger losses than at low densities, where mussels redistributed into a high number of patches. Growth rate and condition index of the mussels did not differ between treatments and no relation was found between treatment and number of foraging shore crabs, which was the major predator of mussels in this experiment. We hypothesise that the relation between initial mussel density and mussel loss after relaying is associated with redistribution, with less competition for space when mussels are positioned at the edge of a mussel patch. The very high mussel losses that we observed in the experiment within four weeks after relaying were the major factor in biomass development. Mussel bed formation concerns mussel growers and managers involved in natural mussel bed restoration. Initial mussel survival determines the success of these activities. The present study shows the effects of mussel relaying on spatial redistribution for the first time under field conditions, and underlines the importance of edge effects in understanding mussel loss in redistribution.

Australia's savannas typically are burnt every 1-3 years. Although there are concerns about the effect of frequent fire on recruitment of Australian savanna species, there is a lack of information. This research aimed to determine whether seed or microsite availability limits seedling recruitment of the overstorey tree Eucalyptus miniata and the midstorey shrub Acacia oncinocarpa, whether seed or microsite availability is affected by frequent fire, and the consequent effect on seedling recruitment. 2. Quadrats were established in unburnt areas. Experimental manipulations were addition of seed and/or disturbance of the soil surface to increase the number of microsites suitable for germination. In a second experiment, seed was added to quadrats established in three fire regimes after the annual burning event (unburnt, burnt early in the dry season, burnt late in the dry season). 3. In unburnt areas, seedling regeneration was limited by both seed supply and microsite availability. Both burning regimes reduced seedling emergence, possibly because the reduced canopy cover caused unfavourable microclimate, the increased grass and forb ground cover increased competition for resources, and there was increased loss of seed to seed harvesters. 4. The results indicate that sexual regeneration of these common species is disadvantaged by current burning practices because both seed supply and the number of microsites are reduced. Thus, long-term changes in savanna floristic structure seem likely unless fire managers aim to increase the fire-free intervals. The relative abundance of species able to reproduce vegetatively may increase under frequent fire regimes. Such a change may take a long time to detect given the fire-resistant and long-lived nature of overstorey species, and the capacity for vegetative regeneration in many savanna species. The impacts of fire on limiting seedling regeneration will require savanna managers to consider fire-free intervals of several years for effective recruitment of dominant woody species.","No Terr Univ, Fac Sci Informat Technol & Educ, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia","Setterfield, SA (corresponding author), No Terr Univ, Fac Sci Informat Technol & Educ, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia.",Samantha.Setterfield@ntu.edu.au,"Setterfield, Samantha/E-1720-2011","Setterfield, Samantha/0000-0002-7470-4997",,,,64,76,78,0,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Group size, human disturbance, environment factors, body size of a prey and a predator, season, traits of species and numbers of others factors were thought to have significant impacts on vigilance. Here, in this study we considered only three of them: group size, disturbance, and predation vulnerability and their impact on the vigilance of the Demoiselle crane (Antropoides Virgo). Our results showed that group size, human disturbance, and predation vulnerability significantly affect Demoiselle crane's vigilance. With increasing of group size, the percentage of scanning time by one individual at least in the group increased, while the proportion of vigilant individuals in the group decreased. The group size effect was supported by our study of vigilance in Demoiselle crane and the cranes gained vigilance benefits from increasing their group size. And when the cranes in strong human disturbance area closer to the road, they devoted significantly more time to their vigilance. The significant relationship between crane vigilance and group size might be explained by the high population density and big intraspecific competitions for resources.","[Xu, Feng; Yang, Weikang; Ma, Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, CAS Key Lab Biogeog & Bioresource Arid Land, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Xu, Feng; Yang, Weikang; Ma, Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Mori Wildlife Monitoring & Expt Stn, Mori 831900, Peoples R China; [Xu, Feng; Yang, Weikang; Ma, Ming] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Blank, David A.] CAS Res Ctr Ecol & Environm Cent Asia, Bishkek 720001, Kyrgyzstan","Xu, F; Yang, WK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, CAS Key Lab Biogeog & Bioresource Arid Land, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.; Xu, F; Yang, WK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Mori Wildlife Monitoring & Expt Stn, Mori 831900, Peoples R China.; Xu, F; Yang, WK (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",xufeng@ms.xjb.ac.cn; yangwk@ms.xjb.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31401986, 31572292]; China Biodiversity Observation Networks (Sino BON)","We are grateful to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31401986 and 31572292), and China Biodiversity Observation Networks (Sino BON) for financing this research.

Plants are frequently attacked by consumers that reduce seed numbers. However, our ability to predict whether seed loss results in parallel changes in future recruitment or plant abundance remains poor. Progress in this area requires simultaneously understanding: (1) how spatial variation in environmental conditions influence recruitment and other demographic rates, and (2) how the magnitude of seed loss varies spatially and relative to seed limitation. 2. We experimentally assessed how postdispersal seed predation by deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) influenced recruitment of the native perennial forb, Gaillardia aristata, in western Montana (USA) grasslands. To explore whether seed limitation and the population-level consequences of seed predation varied predictably based on environmental conditions, we added seeds to plots where mice had access or were excluded at sites occurring over a strong gradient of soil characteristics and plant community productivity. We also quantified whether components of Gaillardia demography varied in ways that may compensate for or exacerbate the population-level effects of seed predation across this environmental gradient. 3. Across two replicate years, recruitment was highest at low productivity/soil nutrient sites and decreased towards the opposite end of the gradient. Postdispersal seed predation strongly reduced Gaillardia recruitment in both years, and the impacts of seed predation on recruitment were greater at sites with lower productivity and fewer soil nutrients and decreased towards the opposite end of the gradient. Growth and fecundity varied among populations in ways that could buffer Gaillardia populations from stronger effects of seed predation, whereas survival varied among populations in a way that may intensify these effects. 4. Synthesis. Together, these results show that postdispersal seed predation can importantly limit plant recruitment and that the magnitude of these effects were predicted by variation in underlying environmental conditions that influence recruitment and other key demographic rates.","[Hegstad, Ryan J.; Maron, John L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Hegstad, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",rjhegstad@gmail.com,,"Hegstad, Ryan/0000-0002-4308-3550",Drollinger-Dial Foundation; Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO); NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1553518],"Drollinger-Dial Foundation; Division of Environmental Biology; NSF, Grant/Award Number: 1553518",,67,2,2,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

We examined how contamination of a coniferous forest soil floor by lead (from an abandoned shooting range area) may alter trophic interactions and decomposition processes. We constructed laboratory microcosms containing microbial-based food webs with various trophic structures: microbes alone; microbes with microbivorous-detritivorous enchytraeid worms (Cognettia sphagnetorum, a potential keystone species of boreal forest soil); and microbes, worms, and predatory mites (Lysigamasus spp.) together. The direct toxic effect of lead and the effectiveness of the predators in preying upon the worms were studied in separate experiments. Polluted humic soil (acid-extractable lead concentration was 2,720 +/- 349 mg/kg of dry soil [mean +/- standard error]) was toxic to enchytraeids, and predators effectively reduced worm populations. Positive density-dependent effects of worms on microbes and a trophic cascade from predatory mites to microbes, observed in the unpolluted humus, were not observed in the polluted humus, indicating pollution-induced interaction modification among organisms. Concomitantly, lead pollution altered the process of nutrient mineralization in the humic soil. However, causality and relative importance of direct toxicity and indirect effects of lead on the dynamics of the decomposer food web could not be pointed out. Examination of our results indicates that traditional food web models are incapable of predicting mechanisms that alter dynamics of pollution-stressed belowground food webs.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, FIN-15140 Lahti, Finland","Salminen, J (corresponding author), Lahti Polytech, Fac Technol, Stalberginkatu 10, FIN-1510 Lahti, Finland.",janne.salminen@lpt.fi,,,,,,47,14,14,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0730-7268,1552-8618,,ENVIRON TOXICOL CHEM,Environ.

In natural settings, we also examined occurrence and microhabitat use of two other native fishes, speckled dace, Rhinichthys osculus, and bluehead sucker, Catostomus discobolus. Native species co-occurred, as did rainbow trout and bluehead sucker. However, occurrences of Little Colorado spinedace and speckled dace were not significantly correlated with occurrence of rainbow trout. Total lengths of all three native species were significantly smaller at allopatric sites than at sites sympatric with rainbow trout. Microhabitat characteristics at sites with rainbow trout did not differ from those where the other three species were found, but did differ among the native species. In laboratory experiments with Little Colorado spinedace and rainbow trout, rainbow trout used the lower depth zone most, and spinedace increased use of the lower depth zone upon addition of rainbow trout. In addition, species tended to co-occur in zones, but used cover independently of one-another, suggesting a low level of agonistic interactions. However, after addition of a high density of rainbow trout, spinedace tended to use cover less than before. We suggest that the species can coexist at low rainbow trout densities. Potential negative effects of rainbow trout on Little Colorado spinedace likely increase with increasing densities of rainbow trout, and rainbow trout likely affect smaller size classes of Little Colorado spinedace more than larger ones.","Arizona Game & Fish Dept, Phoenix, AZ 85023 USA","Robinson, AT (corresponding author), Arizona Game & Fish Dept, 2221 W Greenway Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85023 USA.",,,,,,,30,4,4,0,10,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Many weapons are also retained outside of reproductive periods for secondary reasons, but the importance of these secondary functions is poorly understood. Here we leveraged a unique opportunity from the predator-prey system in northern Yellowstone National Park, WY, USA to evaluate whether predation by a widespread, coursing predator (wolves) has influenced a specific weapon trait (antler retention time) in their primary cervid prey (elk). Male elk face a trade-off: individuals casting antlers early begin regrowth before other males, resulting in relatively larger antlers the following year, and thus greater reproductive success, as indicated by research with red deer. We show, however, that male elk that cast their antlers early are preferentially hunted and killed by wolves, despite early casters being in better nutritional condition than antlered individuals. Our results run counter to classic expectations of coursing predators preferring poorer-conditioned individuals, and in so doing, reveal an important secondary function for an exaggerated sexually selected weapon-predatory deterrence. We suggest this secondary function played a key evolutionary role in elk; uniquely among North American cervids, they retain their antlers long after they fulfil their primary role in reproduction.","[Metz, Matthew C.; Hebblewhite, Mark] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Metz, Matthew C.; Stahler, Daniel R.; Smith, Douglas W.] Yellowstone Ctr Resources, Yellowstone Wolf Project, Yellowstone Natl Pk, WY 82190 USA; [Emlen, Douglas J.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [MacNulty, Daniel R.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [MacNulty, Daniel R.] Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Metz, MC (corresponding author), Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.; Metz, MC (corresponding author), Yellowstone Ctr Resources, Yellowstone Wolf Project, Yellowstone Natl Pk, WY 82190 USA.",matthew.metz@umontana.edu,"hebblewhite, mark/G-6164-2013","Hebblewhite, Mark/0000-0001-5382-1361; Metz, Matthew/0000-0002-7037-9891","Yellowstone Forever (Tapeats Fund); National Science Foundation (NSF) Long Term Research in Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0613730, DEB-1245373, DEB-1556248]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OEI-0919781]; University of Montana; Montana Institute on Ecosystems through NSF Established Program","We thank all Yellowstone Wolf Project field technicians and Gallatin Flying Services for data collection, and E.

Consequently, corrective measures such as increasing rabbit populations by restocking have been carried out to help the recovery of predator populations. In order to determine the general applicability of rabbit restocking for predator conservation, we performed three experimental restockings and evaluated their success in relation to season, habitat quality and the number of animals introduced. Rabbits were released either in large or small numbers in all four seasons of the year, and in habitat types defined as 'poor' or 'rich' according to the food availability for rabbits. For each restocking we evaluated rabbit survival, degree of residency and expected population increase. As a rule, the highest restocking success occurred whenever smaller number of rabbits were released in the richest quality habitat. Restocking during the breeding season was less successful than in other seasons. Problems concerning intraspecific competition, reproductive failure and diseases are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Specimens of three small elasmobranch species (smooth dogfish Mustelus canis, clearnose skate Raja eglanteria, and bullnose ray Myliobatis freminvillii) were collected in August 2007 and 2008 from a study area of similar to 150 km(2), extending 22 km south from Ocean City, Maryland, USA (38A degrees 19' N) and offshore from 5- to 20-m depth. Stomach contents indicated that fish were part of the diets of smooth dogfish and clearnose skate at a level comparable with sympatric piscivorous teleosts. However, stable isotope data suggest that piscivory is likely an opportunistic foraging behavior in this habitat. Studied elasmobranchs were secondary-tertiary consumers with diets composed primarily of decapod crustaceans, fish, and mollusks. There was significant overlap in diet composition, spatial distribution, and diel stomach fullness patterns between clearnose skate, southern kingfish Menticirrhus americanus (teleost) and, to a lesser extent, smooth dogfish. Despite this evidence for piscivory, their relatively low densities suggest that predation by these elasmobranchs is unlikely to affect teleost populations in shallow coastal ocean habitats. If shared prey were to become scarce, then competitive interactions are possible.","[Woodland, Ryan Jordan; Secor, David H.] Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Solomons, MD 20688 USA; [Wedge, Madeline E.] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Woodland, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, 1 Williams St,POB 38, Solomons, MD 20688 USA.",woodland@cbl.umces.edu; secor@cbl.umces.edu; mew0027@auburn.edu,"Woodland, Ryan J/D-5344-2017; Secor, D H/D-4367-2012","Woodland, Ryan J/0000-0002-3309-3413; Secor, D H/0000-0001-6007-4827",NOAA/NMFS/CMER/Rutgers UniversityNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Maryland Sea Grant [NA10OAR4170072],"The authors thank Rebecca Wingate, Kari Fenske, Lisa Guy, and the crew of the R/V Seawolf for help during field collection and Richard Doucett at Colorado Plateau Stable Isotope Laboratory for aid in stable isotope sample analysis.

We follow the adaptive dynamics (AD) approach, which provides a deterministic approximation of the evolutionary dynamics of stationary coexisting populations in terms of an ODE system, the so-called AD canonical equation. AD also provides explicit conditions to test whether a stable evolutionary equilibrium of the canonical equation is a branching point-resident and mutant morphs coexist and further differentiate, thus increasing biodiversity-or not. We analyze a standard parameterized family of prey-predator communities, described by the most standard ecological model, and propose an iterative procedure to obtain the branching portrait, explaining the dependence of branching scenarios on two (demographic, environmental, or control) parameters. Among a number of interesting results, in line with field studies and known ecological principles, we find that prey branching is induced by the predation pressure, and is favored when prey intraspecific competition is highly sensitive to the resident-mutant phenotypic mismatch, while predator branching is not possible when prey and predators are present in an equal number of morphs. This results in alternate prey-predator branching sequences with possible phases of prey unilateral branching. The guidelines for deriving a general method for analyzing the evolution of biodiversity are also discussed. The indications that can be obtained typically have a qualitative nature, but can be of help for the long-term conservation and management of biodiversity.","[Landi, Pietro; Dercole, Fabio; Rinaldi, Sergio] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron Informaz & Bioingn, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Rinaldi, Sergio] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Evolut & Ecol Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria","Landi, P (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron Informaz & Bioingn, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",landi@elet.polimi.it; dercole@elet.polimi.it; rinaldi@elet.polimi.it,"Landi, Pietro/P-7371-2018","Landi, Pietro/0000-0002-6373-2992; Dercole, Fabio/0000-0001-9256-0651","Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della RicercaMinistry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) [RBFR08TIA4]","This work was supported by Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca, under project FIRB Futuro in Ricerca Modeling and Analysis of Innovation and Competition Processes, contract RBFR08TIA4.",,56,24,25,1,19,SIAM PUBLICATIONS,PHILADELPHIA,"3600 UNIV CITY SCIENCE CENTER, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19104-2688 USA",0036-1399,1095-712X,,SIAM J APPL MATH,SIAM J.

It was examined in territorial juvenile sea trout Salmo trutta in a small stream. The fry formed groups of two to six fish with adjacent territories and a social hierarchy within each group. It was hypothesized that: (i) as group size increased, the mean number of prey eaten per fish within a group decreased and the variability in prey consumption between fish increased; (ii) prey consumption by individual fish decreased with increasing distance from the food source; (iii) group size increased as the mean water velocity immediately upstream from a group, and hence potential drifting food, increased. Five groups of fry were fed on small shrimps released upstream from each group at a rate of one every 15 s over a 10 min period, this procedure being repeated over 5 days to provide five replicates per group. Experiments were performed three times in 1967, 1969 and 1974 to provide information on 45 groups of fry. The first and third hypotheses were supported, but the second was only partially supported. In 1967 and 1969, territory size and shrimp consumption by individual fry decreased with increasing distance from the food source. This also occurred in 1974, except during a critical period for survival when fry density was exceptionally high with large numbers of sea trout lacking territories. This resulted in sea trout fry with the largest territories eating fewer shrimps than those with medium-sized territories because they spent more time defending their territories against sea trout lacking territories. This study is the first to demonstrate shadow competition in a vertebrate species, but has also shown that territorial defence may modify the consequences of shadow competition when densities are high and there is strong competition for the acquisition of a territory.

In winter, Atlantic silversides, Menidia menidia, occupied the entire water column while other planktivores were rare or absent from the estuary, and they consumed large prey such as mysid shrimps and fish larvae. An immigration of bay anchovies, Anchoa mitchilli, in the spring resulted in a redistribution of species with Atlantic silversides shifting to the surface waters and bay anchovies dominating the lower half of the water column. Both fishes consumed mostly copepods in the springs, but each favored a different species. There was little similarity in the large prey items consumed by the two fishes. Striped anchovies, Anchoa hepsetus, arrived in mid-summer and were most abundant at the surface while bay anchovies continued to dominate the bottom waters. Atlantic silversides were rare in all summer collections. The diets of the two anchovies were similar, but vertical separation during the period of maximum zooplankton abundance probably minimized competition. Rough silversides, Membras martinica, which were obligate surface dwellers, shared the upper water column with striped anchovies, but the two species had very different diets during their period of co-occurrence. Although seasonal changes in fish diets reflected shifts in zoo-plankton composition and all fishes consumed a variety of prey types, preferences for some prey taxa and total avoidance of others were indicated. Electivity indices indicated an especially strong selection for fiddler crab megalopae by all fishes in the summer and fall. All fishes, except rough silversides, which fed almost exclusively on copepods and crab zoeae, consumed large prey items when they were available. Fine scale partitioning of the food resources was apparent in the selection of different copepod and insect species by the fishes. Spatial and temporal separation in the distribution and/or dietary preferences of the zooplanktivores fishes probably reduces the potential for resource competition. Given the high abundances and selectivity of the planktivores, significant impacts on some zooplankton populations probably result.","GOUCHER COLL,TOWSON,MD 21204","ALLEN, DM (corresponding author), UNIV S CAROLINA,BARUCH MARINE FIELD LAB,POB 1630,GEORGETOWN,SC 29442, USA.",,,,,,,51,35,37,0,23,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Hatchery-produced salmon currently outnumber wild salmon in some regions around the Pacific Rim, raising concerns about their ecological impacts on wild salmon. We convened five regional sessions at an international conference to identify and discuss issues related to ecological interactions between wild and hatchery salmon. Session participants were charged with identifying key interaction types by salmon life stage. Each group was asked to summarize key research needs and identify management actions that might be needed to reduce risks from hatchery programs. Some common themes emerged in all the sessions, including the importance of predation and competition interactions in freshwater environments during juvenile life stages and breeding interactions among adults. Much less is understood about interactions in estuarine and marine ecosystems, even though these environments may be critical in determining recruitment success. Some groups identified a need for field experiments to test hypotheses related to ecological interactions and the need to understand and, where possible, control hatchery straying. Some groups also discussed the importance of carrying capacity in different environments and how hatchery programs may be contributing to density-dependent effects. There is a lack of focused studies on ecological interactions between wild and hatchery salmon in the Western Pacific. The authors of this paper hope to encourage new research efforts to better understand ecological interactions to help inform management efforts aimed at reducing hatchery risks to wild salmon.","[Rand, Peter S.; Lincoln, Rich] Wild Salmon Ctr, State Salmon Program, Portland, OR USA; [Berejikian, Barry A.] NOAA NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Manchester, WA USA; [Bidlack, Allison] Ecotrust Copper River Program, Cordova, AK USA; [Bottom, Dan; Weitkamp, Laurie A.] NOAA NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Newport, OR USA; [Gardner, Julie] Dovetail Consulting, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Kaeriyama, Masahide] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Fisheries Sci, Hakodate, Hokkaido, Japan; [Nagata, Mitsuhiro] Hokkaido Salmon & Freshwater Fisheries Res Inst, Eniwa, Japan; [Pearsons, Todd N.] Grant Cty Publ Util Dist, Ephrata, WA USA; [Schmidt, Michael] Long Live Kings, Seattle, WA USA; [Smoker, William W.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Sch Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Juneau, AK USA; [Zhivotovsky, Lev A.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Gen Genet, Moscow V71, Russia","Rand, PS (corresponding author), Wild Salmon Ctr, State Salmon Program, Portland, OR USA.",prand@wildsalmoncenter.org,"Zhivotovsky, Lev A/A-1351-2012; Kaeriyama, Masahide/A-8500-2012",,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24121008] Funding Source: KAKEN",,,20,19,20,2,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

To date, such studies have been limited. To help fill this gap, we conducted reciprocal transplant experiments with two pupfish species, Cyprinodon atrorus and C. bifasciatus, to assess the importance of environmental factors in their hybridization dynamics. Results from our experiments show that C. atrorus survives well when environmental variability is low or high, whereas C. bifasciatus only survives well when environmental variability is low. This corroborates the hypothesis that C. atrorus is euryplastic and C. bifasciatus stenoplastic, and also provides evidence that differential environmental tolerance may be important in regulating the distribution of genetic variation in hybrid zones between these species. However, these differences do not explain why C. atrorus is absent from C. bifasciatus habitats. This absence is likely determined at least in part by other exogenous selection factors, such as disproportionate predator susceptibility and/or inferior competitive ability of C. atrorus.

Our results are also compared with experimental assemblages modified by water and dry abiotic abrasion. These provide a baseline to understand the nature of the agents causing modifications to archaeological vertebrae from the Middle Holocene Argentinian sites of El Americano II and Barrio Las Dunas and the Magdalenian site of Santa Catalina (Basque Country, Spain). The experimental frame of reference allowed us to identify dry compression on Barrio Las Dunas and Santa Catalina assemblages and wet compression on El Americano II and Santa Catalina sites, improving our interpretation of the formation of those archaeological deposits and their fish assemblages.

For instance, amphibian populations living far from agriculture (a proxy for agrochemical exposure) exhibit low pesticide tolerance, but they can be induced to possess high tolerance following a sublethal pesticide exposure. In contrast, amphibian populations close to agriculture exhibit high, constitutive tolerance to pesticides. A recent study has demonstrated that induced pesticide tolerance appears to have arisen from plastic responses to predator cues. As a result, we might expect that selection for constitutive pesticide tolerance in populations near agriculture (i.e., genetic assimilation) will lead to the evolution of constitutive responses to natural stressors. Using 15 wood frog (Rana sylvatica) populations from across an agricultural gradient, we conducted an outdoor mesocosm experiment to examine morphological (mass, body length, and tail depth) and behavioral responses (number of tadpoles observed and overall activity) of tadpoles exposed to three stressor environments (no-stressor, competitors, or predator cues). We discovered widespread differences in tadpole traits among populations and stressor environments, but no population-by-environment interaction. Subsequent linear models revealed that population distance to agriculture (DTA) was occasionally correlated with tadpole traits in a given environment and with magnitudes of plasticity, but none of the correlations were significant after Bonferroni adjustment. The magnitudes of predator and competitor plasticity were never correlated with the magnitude of pesticide-induced plasticity that we documented in a companion study. These results suggest that while predator-induced plasticity appears to have laid the foundation for the evolution of pesticide-induced plasticity and its subsequent genetic assimilation, inspection of population-level differences in plastic responses show that the evolution of pesticide-induced plasticity has not had a reciprocal effect on the evolved plastic responses to natural stressors.","[Jones, Devin K.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Jones, Devin K.; Mattes, Brian M.; Relyea, Rick A.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Darrin Fresh Water Inst, Dept Biol Sci, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Hua, Jessica] SUNY Binghamton, Biol Sci Dept, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Cothran, Rickey D.] Southwestern Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Weatherford, OK 73096 USA; [Hoverman, Jason T.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Jones, DK (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.; Jones, DK (corresponding author), Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Darrin Fresh Water Inst, Dept Biol Sci, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",devin.k.jones@gmail.com,"Hoverman, Jason T/D-1756-2013","Hoverman, Jason T/0000-0002-4002-2728",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 11-19430]; Arthur and Barbara Pape Endowment; G.

Here we tested whether North American red squirrels () adjust their behavior in response to local population density and whether they use rates of territorial vocalizations in their local neighborhood to assess density. We examined these relationships using 18 years of live trapping and 20 years of behavioral data that were collected across natural variation in local population density. To disentangle the effects of population density on behavior from those due to changes in per capita food abundance or changes in the frequency of antagonistic interactions with neighbors, we also experimentally manipulated population density with long-term food supplementation as well as perceived population density with long-term playbacks of territorial vocalizations. The frequency with which squirrels emitted territorial vocalizations was positively associated with local population density. In contrast, antagonistic physical interactions observed between squirrels and territorial intrusions were rare and the frequency of intrusions was weakly and negatively, not positively, associated with population density. Squirrels experiencing naturally and experimentally high density conditions spent less time in the nest and feeding but more time being vigilant. Similar density-dependent changes in behavior were observed in response to our manipulations of perceived population density, indicating that vocalization rates and not physical interactions or food abundance were the mechanism by which squirrels assessed and responded behaviorally to changes in local density.","[Dantzer, Ben; McAdam, Andrew G.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Boutin, Stan] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Humphries, Murray M.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [McAdam, Andrew G.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Dantzer, B (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",bendantzer@gmail.com,"Boutin, Stan A/A-2619-2014; McAdam, Andrew G/G-1802-2010; Dantzer, Ben/E-9779-2011","Boutin, Stan A/0000-0001-6317-038X; McAdam, Andrew G/0000-0001-7323-2572; Dantzer, Ben/0000-0002-3058-265X","Animal Behavior Society, American Society of Mammalogists; Arctic Institute of North America; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF)","We thank Adam Goble for supplying the squirrel vocalization recordings and Rudy Boonstra for providing comments on a previous version of this manuscript.

The patterns and causes of algal zonation in small, steeply sided, mid-intertidal pools (potholes) were investigated on the Oregon coast. From top to bottom, pools were characterized by a foliose algal zone (pool edges), a crustose coralline algal zone (pool sides), and a bare zone (pool bottoms). These zonation patterns were extremely persistent. Erect fleshy algae fluctuated seasonally, with peaks in abundance during the summer. Seasonal variation was consistent between years, not only among all pools but also in individual pools. The relative importances of physical disturbance and biotic interactions in determining tidepool community structure were evaluated along a gradient of physical harshness. The pools studied here offered the opportunity to experimentally manipulate physical disturbance which is often difficult, rarely done, and essential to our understanding of community organization. Using a factorial experimental design, cobbles, limpets and coralline algae, a major space occupier in tidepools, were manipulated. Identically designed experiments were performed at both wave-exposed and wave-protected sites using identical replicate pools chiseled out of rock benches. Scouring by cobbles generally reduced the abundance of organisms in pools, limited them to higher areas in pools, or both. The effects of cobbles were especially apparent on pool bottoms or on the depth distribution of algae, suggesting that there was a strong vertical gradient of scouring where cobbles were present. This scouring gradient was confirmed in natural pools by measuring scouring rates with painted plates, and scouring evidently led to the zonation patterns observed in natural pools. Herbivores had no effect on algal distributions within tidepools, but evidently influenced the relative abundance of fleshy algae at different wave exposures. Abundant herbivorous snails at protected sites may have resulted in a high proportion of herbivore-resistant coralline algae and more bare space, while at exposed sites, herbivorous snails were scarce and fleshy algae were more abundant. Removal of all corallines resulted in an increase in the abundance of fleshy crustose algae at both sites, suggesting that corallines pre-empt space from fleshy crusts. Competition among fronds of erect algal groups was evaluated by reciprocally removing the fronds of erect fleshy and erect coralline algae. After the removal of erect fleshy or erect coralline algal fronds, only slight changes were observed over IS months, suggesting that competition between algal fronds is unimportant in determining algal distribution and abundance. For these intertidal potholes, aIgal distributions within pools are largely determined by the physical process of scouring, but herbivores may cause between site variations in pool communities.","OREGON STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA",,,,,,,,40,28,29,2,65,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,1879-1697,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Wildlife, which can dually shape the tree recruitment process by simultaneously functioning as natural enemies and seed dispersers, are undergoing widespread changes in population and behaviour due to the detrimental effects of expanding global road networks. However, the impact of these changes on recruitment dynamics through the alteration of seed dispersal processes remains understudied. Here, we assessed how roads affect animal-mediated recruitment dynamics from the seed to adult stages of trees using a ubiquitous vertebrate-seed model: rodents and acorns. To quantify the degree to which proximity to a road alters seed dispersal and regulates subsequent recruitment dynamics, we conducted seed dispersal and predation experiments, and investigated the natural recruitment of a dominant tree species (Quercus aliena) from September 2009 to July 2012 in a subtropical forest of central China. Roads caused a decreased seed dispersal distance and increasing larder hoarding, demonstrating a weakened contribution of rodents to seed dispersal services. These patterns were stronger in the masting year than in the non-masting year. Correspondingly, seedlings, saplings and adult trees had higher densities near roads than far from roads. Near roads, recruit transition rates (i.e. seedling-to-sapling and sapling-to-juvenile) were low, and the influential strength of conspecific adult density was weakened over these recruit transitions, indicating that space limitation and lottery competition, not conspecific negative density-dependent effects, approximately determined the near-road recruitment process. Furthermore, most adults near roads were young, and their ages matched the road ages. Synthesis. Roads diminished animal-mediated seed dispersal services and disrupted subsequent recruitment dynamics in Quercus aliena populations, thus weakening the key process promoting diversity in forest ecosystems. Given that these animal-regulated roles in recruitment dynamics are widespread stabilizing forces for tree coexistence, our findings suggest that the ubiquity of roads and their continued expansion will contribute to the increase in forests dominated by a relatively low number of species. Consequently, the growing expansion of road networks will ultimately cause profound changes in community composition and structure across diverse forests worldwide.","[Chen, Wenwen; Zhong, Jie; Xie, Zongqiang; Zhou, Youbing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wenwen; Sun, Shucun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Jie; Tang, Zhanhui] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Carson, Walter P.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Zhou, YB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhouyb@ibcas.ac.cn,,"Sun, Shucun/0000-0003-0748-8048",,,,46,7,7,8,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Distinct differences in the basic features of population dynamics were detected between the two rice cropping seasons: (1) In the wet season, BPH populations multiplied rapidly in the period from initial to peak generation, reaching quite often the destructive level despite the low density of initial immigrants. However, in the dry season, the population growth rate and the peak population density were much lower than those in the wet season. The abundance of natural enemies such as arthropod predators played a major role in determining such a difference in seasonal population development. (2) The density at the peak generation or the occurrence of outbreaks in each field was predictable in the wet season with fairly high accuracy on the basis of the density at the initial or previous seasonal generations. In the dry season, however, the rate of population growth and the peak population density widely varied among the fields depending on the water status in each field. (3) Density-dependent processes to regulate the population density were detected in both cropping seasons. In the wet season, the regulatory processes were only detected in such high densities as cause the considerable deterioration of host plants, which suggested that the processes were largely attributable to intra-specific competition. In the dry season, however, the regulatory processes operated at a much lower density in the earlier stages of the crops. The results of an analysis of adult longevity or residence period suggested that the density-dependent dispersal of macropterous adults played an important role in stabilizing the population fluctuation among the fields in the early dry season.","KYOTO UNIV,FAC AGR,ENTOMOL LAB,KYOTO 606,JAPAN; MINIST AGR,DIRECTORATE FOOD CROP PROTECT,JAKARTA,INDONESIA",,,"Kusmayadi, Andri/ABA-4192-2020",,,,,29,10,11,0,6,SOC POPULATION ECOLOGY,KYOTO,"SHIMOTACHIURI OGAWA-HIGASHI KAMIKYO-KU, KYOTO 602, JAPAN",0034-5466,,,RES POPUL ECOL,Res.

We investigated why surf-zone fishes, which are introduced to the island ponds during periodic wash-over events, are unable to persist for extended periods. We simulated over-wash events by collecting fishes from the shallow surf-zone and introducing them into 0.56 m(2) field enclosures. During summer months. surf-zone fishes typically died within 24 h. Levels of dissolved oxygen and temperature frequently exceeded the tolerance limits of the surf-zone fishes (demonstrated in a series of laboratory experiments), suggesting that these variables were responsible for fish mortality. In non-summer months, when dissolved oxygen and temperature stresses were ameliorated, surf-zone fishes could survive for months in the ponds. We conducted field-enclosure experiments at 3 fish densities in order to evaluate the survival and condition of a common surf-zone fish, Membras martinica (the rough silverside): (1) 8 M. martinica (14 fish m(-2)), (2) 16 M, martinica (28 fish m(-2)), and (3) 8 M. martinica + 8 Fundulus heteroclitus (28 fish m(-2)). After approximately 1 mo during the spring, fall and winter, survival and condition of fishes in Treatments 2 and 3 were significantly reduced, suggesting that biological interactions were an important cause of surf-zone fish mortality. A temporal environmental stress gradient may result in seasonally varying importance of abiotic and biotic structuring factors.","Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA","Layman, CA (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, 210 Nagle Hall, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",cal1634@unix.tamu.edu,,,,,,103,24,24,0,14,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

I explored the influence of variable input (''supply'') on subsequent densities of juveniles and adults in open local populations of two temperate reef fishes, the bluebanded goby (Lythrypnus dalli) and the blackeye goby (Coryphopterus nicholsii). Variable recruitment was simulated by stocking a natural range of densities of young fishes on replicate patch reefs. Density and mortality of the stocked cohorts were followed over time, until the fishes reached maturity. Over the first day of the experiments, mortality of both species was significantly density-dependent; however, there was still a very strong relationship between density on day 1 and density on day 0 (i.e., simulated recruitment was still an excellent predictor of population density). At this point in the study, the main effects of density-dependent mortality were to reduce mean densities and variation about the mean. Over the;period from the start of the experiments until the time when maturity was reached by each species (about 1 and 3 months for Lythrypnus and Coryphopterus, respectively), mortality was strongly density-dependent. Such strong density-dependent mortality virtually eliminated any linear relationship between adult density and ''recruit'' density. However, for both species, the relationship between these two variables was well fit by an asymptotic curve, with the asymptotic density of adults equal to c. 3/m(2) for Coryphopterus, and c. 10/m(2) for Lythrypnus. Natural recruitment (via settlement of larvae) to the reefs over the period of the study (9 months) was above the asymptotic densities of adults for the two species, even though the study did not encompass the periods of peak annual recruitment of either species. This suggests that adult populations of these two gobies may often be limited, and regulated, by post-settlement processes, rather than by input of settlers. Other studies have shown that mortality of the two species is density-independent, or only weakly density-dependent, on reefs from which predators have been excluded. Hence, it appears that predators cause density-dependent mortality in these fishes.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT BIOL SCI, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA",,,,,,,,60,61,61,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1997,112,1,,,,,64,74,,10.1007/s004420050284,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XW916,WOS:A1997XW91600010,28307377,,,,2021-09-27,

Despite the importance of large predators in terrestrial trophic webs, little is still known about how fire affects carnivorans (the mammalian order Carnivora). To evaluate the responses of the carnivoran community to fire, we studied three recently burnt forest areas in the western Mediterranean basin. Line transects were used to quantify evidence of carnivorans (mainly feces) and to measure environmental variables and resources (small mammal abundance, fleshy fruit availability, and plant cover). Throughout the study, we found 212 carnivoran field signs, 93% of them produced by red fox and stone marten. Immediately after fire, carnivoran occurrence was more frequent close to the perimeter of the burnt area, where fire severity was low, and in places with greater small mammal abundance. Small mammal abundance and plant cover had the greatest effect on the frequency of occurrence of red fox in the burnt area surroundings, and this increased with time-since-fire in the burnt area. Furthermore, the presence of red fox did not affect stone marten occurrence. Stone martens were found around the burnt area perimeter, probably because of their preference for high plant cover, and they were not significantly affected by small mammal abundance. The scat frequency of occurrence of both species was not significantly related to fleshy fruit availability. Accordingly, rodents and carnivorans were more abundant where the habitat was more complex. Our results show that the responses of some carnivorans to fire are influenced, directly and indirectly, by habitat structure and resource availability.","[Puig-Girones, Roger; Pons, Pere] Univ Girona, Dept Ciencies Ambientals, Girona 17003, Catalonia, Spain","Puig-Girones, R (corresponding author), Univ Girona, Dept Ciencies Ambientals, Girona 17003, Catalonia, Spain.",roger.puig.girones@gmail.com; pere.pons@udg.edu,"Puig-Girones, Roger/R-4943-2016; Pons, Pere/B-9472-2008","Puig-Girones, Roger/0000-0002-4692-8192; Pons, Pere/0000-0002-2196-5544",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2014-54094-R],This study was funded by project CGL2014-54094-R from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.,,68,1,1,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,AUG,2020,11,8,,,,,,,855,10.3390/f11080855,,,15,Forestry,Forestry,NK9MT,WOS:000567053400001,,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-27,

Yet, in the past decade, some new and occasionally counterintuitive effects of prey quality on food web dynamics emerged from both experiments and mathematical modeling. The underpinning of this work is the theory of ecological stoichiometry that is centered on the fact that each organism is a mixture of multiple chemical elements such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). The ratios of these elements can vary within and among species, providing simple ways to represent prey quality as its C:N or C:P ratios. When these ratios modeled to vary, as they frequently do in nature, seemingly paradoxical results can arise such as the extinction of a predator that has an abundant and accessible prey. Here, for the first time, we show analytically that the reduction in prey quality can give rise to chaotic oscillations. In particular, when competing predators differ in their sensitivity to prey quality then all species can coexist via chaotic fluctuations. The chaos generating mechanism is based on the existence of a junction-fold point on the nullcline surfaces of the species. Conditions on parameters are found for such a point, and the singular perturbation method and the kneading sequence analysis are used to demonstrate the existence of a period-doubling cascade to chaos as a result of the point.","Univ Nebraska, Dept Math, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA","Deng, B (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Math, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",bdeng@math.unl.edu; iloladze@math.unl.edu,"Loladze, Irakli/B-5638-2009","Loladze, Irakli/0000-0001-7615-7803",,,,27,15,15,0,17,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"CIRCULATION & FULFILLMENT DIV, 2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1 N O 1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",1054-1500,1089-7682,,CHAOS,Chaos,SEP,2007,17,3,,,,,,,33108,10.1063/1.2752491,,,14,"Mathematics, Applied; Physics, Mathematical",Mathematics; Physics,215CY,WOS:000249787100008,17902990,,,,2021-09-27,

Most of the evidence suggested that Dinocras cephalotes did not choose between Baetis rhodani and Rhithrogena semicolorata as, under identical circumstances: (i) the survival of both prey types was the same; (ii) the predator's overall searching behaviour was similar in the presence of either mayfly, although B. rhodani was pursued more, especially on complex substrates; (iii) the number of attacks on both prey types was the same; and (iv) the intake of dry weight prey biomass over 24 h remained the same, irrespective of prey species. 3. The predation efficiency (no. of prey captured/no. of encounters) of D. cephalotes decreased with increasing substrate complexity-but only with R. semicolorata as prey, and also when more than one stonefly was present-but only when B. rhodani was the prey. Predator efficiency was greater at low densities of R. semicolorata but highest at a medium density of B. rhodani. 4. Increase in the body weight of D. cephalotes was greater when nymphs were fed a monospecific diet of R. semicolorata compared with one of B. rhodani. This was despite the findings that: (i) nymphs of B. rhodani contained 31.3% more protein (per mg dry body weight) than nymphs of R. semicolorata, whereas the latter contained 81.0% more chitin; and (ii) nymphs of R. semicolorata took 2.7 times as long to consume and almost twice as long to pass through the predator's gut. The longer gut passage time may have allowed a greater assimilation efficiency which may have led to the observed better growth. 5. Dinocras cephalotes is thought to feed opportunistically, with a certain daily food biomass intake as its primary need rather than any specific prey preference. Foraging decisions, or opportunities, affect the fitness of individual nymphs and this may be reflected in the wide size range of contemporary nymphs found in field populations. Variation in foraging efficiency by predators and evasion success by prey, across substrate types, is thought to contribute to the well-known microdistribution patterns of species observed in lotic communities.","UNIV WALES,SCH BIOL SCI,BANGOR LL57 2UW,GWYNEDD,WALES",,,,,,,,24,21,21,0,10,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

We conducted a field experiment with a suspected trophic cascade. Could an entomopathogenic nematode protect bush lupine by killing root-feeding ghost moth caterpillars? The experiment measured survival of lupine seedlings as a function of density of hatchling ghost moth caterpillars in rhizospheres with or without the entomopathogenic nematode. We modeled lupine survival with a hierarchical family of one-hit dose response models to interpret the results of the experiment. We obtained maximum likelihood estimates of parameters and selected the best-fitting model using the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC). The best model fit the data closely, and SIC model selection was consistent with classical likelihood ratio test results of models nested in the one-hit family. A parallel analysis performed upon a logistic family of models yielded results of poorer fit but largely consistent with results of the one-hit analysis. Finally, we compared our model-centered approach with the conventional methods-centered approach of logistic regression in statistical packages. While these packages give correct calculations, the implications of hypothesis tests are ecologically obscure in the absence of the explicit representation of models and their hierarchical relationships. For understanding ecological data, building an explicit statistical model of the process and testing parameters can be more: informative than accepting the implicit model and testing variables in canned statistical packages. The ecological implications were that seedling survival decreased exponentially with increasing densities of root-feeding caterpillars, and the entomopathogenic nematode virtually canceled the negative effect: of this herbivore upon seedling survival. However, the significance to the broader community of this trophic cascade remains to be demonstrated. This cascade is a module or vignette within the greater food web, and additional interactions affect its influence: intraguild predation by nematode predators, apparent competition from other herbivores of lupine (each with its own natural enemies), and even more complicated interactions through competing plant species all come into play. As well, genetic variation of both the lupine and ghost moth caterpillars affects these interactions. Evidence does not support the inference that protection from ghost moth caterpillars by the entomopathogenic nematode is key to the green world of bush lupine.","Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA; Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; Univ Idaho, Div Stat, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Strong, DR (corresponding author), Bodega Marine Lab, Box 247, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA.",,,,,,,56,72,74,2,33,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,1999,80,8,,,,,2750,2761,,10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2750:MSFAST]2.0.CO;2,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,264VR,WOS:000084204100024,,,,,2021-09-27,

In this study, we conducted habitat choice experiments to determine how water temperature influences habitat preference for three common species of coral reef damselfish (Pomacentridae) that differ in their levels of habitat specialisation. The lemon damselfish Pomacentrus moluccensis, a habitat specialist, consistently selected complex coral habitat across all temperature treatments (selected based on local average seasonal temperatures naturally experienced insitu: ambient winter 22 degrees C; ambient summer 28 degrees C; and elevated 31 degrees C). Unexpectedly, the neon damselfish Pomacentrus coelestis and scissortail sergeant Abudefduf sexfasciatus, both of which have more generalist habitat associations, developed strong habitat preferences (for complex coral and boulder habitat, respectively) at the elevated temperature treatment (31 degrees C) compared to no single preferred habitat at 22 degrees C or 28 degrees C. The observed shifts in habitat preference with temperature suggest that we may be currently underestimating the vulnerability of some habitat generalists to climate change and highlight that the ongoing loss of complex live coral through coral bleaching could further exacerbate resource overlap and species competition in ways not currently considered in climate change models.","[Matis, Paloma A.; Donelson, Jennifer M.; Fox, Rebecca J.; Booth, David J.] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Broadway, NSW, Australia; [Donelson, Jennifer M.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Bush, Stephen] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Math & Phys Sci, Broadway, NSW, Australia","Matis, PA (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Broadway, NSW, Australia.",paloma.matis@uts.edu.au,"; Donelson, Jennifer/M-5531-2018","Booth, David/0000-0002-8256-1412; Donelson, Jennifer/0000-0002-0039-5300; Matis, Paloma/0000-0003-3675-3576","NSW Environmental Trust [2011/RD/0051]; Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney; Australian Government Research Training Program ScholarshipAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science","NSW Environmental Trust, Grant/Award Number: 2011/RD/0051; The Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney and an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship (P.A.M)",,111,11,11,3,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

Nonnative predators are of particular interest because they represent novel threats to native prey species that are not adapted to their presence. Prey species with limited distributions or population sizes may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of nonnative predators. In the Laramie River, four nonnative predators-Brown Trout Salmo trutta, Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis, and Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu are present along with a state-imperiled population of Hornyhead Chub Nocomis biguttatus. The abundance of Hornyhead Chub has declined with increasing abundance of nonnative predators, with the probability of occurrence of Hornyhead Chub dropping drastically when Smallmouth Bass were present. All four nonnative species preyed on native cyprinids, but Smallmouth Bass relied most heavily on fish as a prey item. Isotopic niche overlap occurred between Hornyhead Chub and all of the nonnative predator species. Our results demonstrate that nonnative predators have the potential to negatively affect the abundance and distribution of Hornyhead Chub through the mechanisms of predation and competition, and predator identity is important in determining the extent of effects. Smallmouth Bass are a greater concern than nonnative salmonids because of their more piscivorous behavior, and their recent upstream expansion may be limiting the downstream distribution of Hornyhead Chub in the Laramie River.","[Hickerson, Brian T.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Wyoming Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Maitland, Bryan M.] Univ Wyoming, Program Ecol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Maitland, Bryan M.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Walters, Annika W.] Univ Wyoming, US Geol Survey, Wyoming Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Hickerson, BT (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Wyoming Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",bhicker1@uwyo.edu,,"Walters, Annika/0000-0002-8638-6682",Wyoming Game and Fish Department,"We thank Steve Gale and Bobby Compton for their invaluable assistance in the field and expert advice in project planning.

In the present study we assessed the impact of fish predation in a mussel farm sited in the Ria de Ares-Betanzos (Galicia, NW Spain). To assess fish impact on recruitment, we have quantified mussel recruitment densities with or without excluding fish predation. The experiment was carried out using four different collector rope designs that could contribute to decrease the fish predation impact on the amount of musse seed collected for cultivation. The unprotected long-line (fish exposed treatment) showed lower recruitment densities than the protected one (fish exclusion treatment) for every collector design tested (between 38 and 58%; ANOVA, p < 0.001) with the exception of non-filamentous loop complement ropes (NF-L), which showed similar density values (9104 +/- 316 and 7855 +/- 375indiv/m in the protected and unprotected long-line, respectively; Tukey p>0.05). In addition, in the protected long-line recruitment densities were homogeneous between collector designs (8820 +/- 635 indiv/m: ANOVA p > 0 05) whereas in the unprotected one statistically significant differences between collectors were observed, These results pointed out the influence of fish predation in the amount of mussel seed collected and its different effect between collector designs. The homogeneous density recorded in the protected long-line between collector designs would suggest the presence of another regulation factor of population size when fish predation is excluded. This regulation factor could be the intra-specific competition derived by space ani food limitations of the studied area. With regard to the collector design, differences in recruitment density in the unprotected long-line would suggest different degree of protection from predators depending 1 in collector texture and lacing complexity which could enhance the strength of seed attachment and create space refuges from fish.

This leads to the prediction that these traits should show stronger condition dependence and larger genetic variance than other traits subject to weaker or stabilizing selection. While empirical evidence of condition dependence in postcopulatory traits is increasing, the comparison between sexually selected and control' traits is often based on untested assumption concerning the different strength of selection acting on these traits. Furthermore, information on selection in the past is essential, as both condition dependence and genetic variance of a trait are likely to be influenced by the pattern of selection acting historically on it. Using the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a livebearing fish with high levels of multiple paternity, we performed three independent experiments on three ejaculate quality traits, sperm number, velocity, and size, which have been previously shown to be subject to strong, intermediate, and weak directional postcopulatory selection, respectively. First, we conducted an inbreeding experiment to determine the pattern of selection in the past. Second, we used a diet restriction experiment to estimate their level of condition dependence. Third, we used a half-sib/full-sib mating design to estimate the coefficients of additive genetic variance (CVA) underlying these traits. Additionally, using a simulated predator evasion test, we showed that both inbreeding and diet restriction significantly reduced condition. According to predictions, sperm number showed higher inbreeding depression, stronger condition dependence, and larger CVA than sperm velocity and sperm size. The lack of significant genetic correlation between sperm number and velocity suggests that the former may respond to selection independently one from other ejaculate quality traits. Finally, the association between sperm number and condition suggests that this trait may mediate the genetic benefits of polyandry which have been shown in this species.","[Gasparini, Clelia; Devigili, Alessandro; Dosselli, Ryan; Pilastro, Andrea] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, I-35131 Padua, Italy","Pilastro, A (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Via U Bassi 58-B, I-35131 Padua, Italy.",andrea.pilastro@unipd.it,"Dosselli, Ryan/A-7230-2012; Gasparini, Clelia/F-2159-2011","Dosselli, Ryan/0000-0001-6524-5138; Devigili, Alessandro/0000-0001-8104-5195; Pilastro, Andrea/0000-0001-9803-6308","University of Padova [CPDT058772, CPDR089052/08]; MIURMinistry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) [2008Z8ACTN]; Fondazione CARIPARO (Progetto di Eccellenza)Fondazione Cariparo [217/08]","This research was funded by the University of Padova (Grant Nos.

Here we describe the feeding and dispersal behavior of Paratemnoides nidificator, a Neotropical pseudoscorpion presenting non-territorial permanent-sociality. Field and laboratory observations (100 hours and 200 sessions over four years) and manipulative experiments revealed that P. nidificator is a generalist predator that lives in rough bark of trees, in groups of 2 to 175 individuals (42.62 +/- 28.27; N=35 colonies; solitary individuals were never found), including reproductive adults and nymphs. Individuals in groups cooperatively capture prey four times larger than solitary individuals. Adult hunters share food with siblings. Reproduction in natural conditions occurs during the hot/wet season, when food availability is high. Prey diversity and abundance seem to be the main factor limiting reproduction in this species. Phoresy (attachment to a transporter animal) is the basic mode of dispersion in P. nidificator. Grouped individuals use large animals as vectors for dispersal, and once established they use the vector as the first food item of the new colony. However, they can also disperse by colony fission, newly documented herein for this taxon. The elaborate, cooperative behavior in P. nidificator is unique among pseudoscorpions and represents an excellent model for studies on the evolution of sociality in invertebrates.","Univ Fed Uberlandia, PGECRN, Inst Biol, Lab Ecol Comportamental & Interacoes, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil","Del-Claro, K (corresponding author), Univ Fed Uberlandia, PGECRN, Inst Biol, Lab Ecol Comportamental & Interacoes, CP 593, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil.",delclaro@ufu.br,"Del-Claro, K/C-5570-2013; Tizo-Pedroso, Everton/A-7999-2012; Del-Claro, Kleber/N-3700-2019","Del-Claro, K/0000-0001-8886-9568; Tizo-Pedroso, Everton/0000-0001-7064-2103; ",,,,44,27,35,0,19,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",0020-1812,1420-9098,,INSECT SOC,Insect.

In which case, the attack distance, the distance over which one animal attacks another in an attempt to steal food, determines to a large extent the competitor density range over which interference significantly affects the intake rate of foraging animals. We develop a simple model of kleptoparasitism containing three parameters: attack distance, the density of foraging animals and a single dimensionless parameter alpha which summarizes the non-geometrical aspects of the interference process. Dominant and subdominant animals are not considered separately. The model predicts that the average intake rate will decrease exponentially with animal density and that a measure of the strength of interference depends on attack distance squared. The simple model is compared with a much more detailed individual-based foraging model from the literature. Simulated average intake rates are indeed well approximated by an exponential decrease with competitor density. Also the measure of interference behaves in the way expected from the simple model. By explaining the shape of the relationship between intake rate and animal density, the simple model provides insight into the behaviour of the detailed behavioural model. Insight into the role of geometry is important in the interpretation of field results and in the further development of detailed foraging models. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Only in the last two decades has the species become naturalized and invasive in some parts of its new range, notably in semi-arid savannas. Research is being undertaken to predict its potential for further invasion in South Africa. We studied production, dispersal and predation of seeds, seed banks, and seedling establishment in relation to land uses at three sites, namely ungrazed savanna once used as a military training ground; a savanna grazed by native game; and an ungrazed mine dump. We found that seed production and seed rain density of S. molle varied greatly between study sites, but was high at all sites (384 864-1 233 690 seeds per tree per year; 3877-9477 seeds per square metre per year). We found seeds dispersed to distances of up to 320 m from female trees, and most seeds were deposited within 50 m of putative source trees. Annual seed rain density below canopies of Acacia tortillis, the dominant native tree at all sites, was significantly lower in grazed savanna. The quality of seed rain was much reduced by endophagous predators. Seed survival in the soil was low, with no survival recorded beyond 1 year. Propagule pressure to drive the rate of recruitment: densities of seedlings and sapling densities were higher in ungrazed savanna and the ungrazed mine dump than in grazed savanna, as reflected by large numbers of young individuals, but adult : seedling ratios did not differ between savanna sites. Frequent and abundant seed production, together with effective dispersal of viable S. molle seed by birds to suitable establishment sites below trees of other species to overcome predation effects, facilitates invasion. Disturbance enhances invasion, probably by reducing competition from native plants.","[Richardson, David M.] Univ Stellenbosch, Ctr Invas Biol, Dept Bot & Zool, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Iponga, Donald M.; Milton, Suzanne J.] Univ Stellenbosch, Ctr Invas Biol, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","Richardson, DM (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Ctr Invas Biol, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag 11, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",rich@sun.ac.za,"Richardson, David M/A-1495-2008","Richardson, David M/0000-0001-9574-8297; Milton, Suzanne Jane/0000-0003-4390-6040",DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion BiologyDepartment of Science & Technology (India),We acknowledge financial support from the DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology and Dr W.R.J.

Medium-sized ungulates, in particular chital Axis axis, was the main food of both predators, but leopards consumed significantly larger proportions of domestic animals, small mammals, and birds than tigers. Tiger sign were never found outside the park, while leopard sign occurred both inside and outside, and were significantly closer to the park border than tiger sign. Significantly higher prey densities at locations of tiger sign than that of leopards were mainly due to a preference of the latter species for the park border areas. Our results imply that interference competition--and not competition for food--was a limiting factor for the leopard population, whose distribution was restricted to the margins of the tiger territories. We suggest that the composition of the prey base is a key factor in understanding the different results and interpretations reported in studies on tiger/leopard coexistence. There are two potential mechanisms that link interference competition and prey: (1) low abundance of large ungulate prey decreases foraging efficiency of tigers, leading to increased energetic stress and aggression towards leopards; and (2) increased diet overlap due to scarcity of large prey leads to increased encounter rates and increased levels of interference competition.","[Odden, Morten; Wegge, Per] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, N-1432 As, Norway","Odden, M (corresponding author), Hedmark Univ Coll, Campus Evenstad, N-2418 Elverum, Norway.",morten.odden@hihm.no; per.wegge@umb.no,,,Royal Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD); Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"This study was funded by the Royal Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) as part of a collaborative research program between the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation/Nepal and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences.

In aquatic environments, most taxa use chemical cues to assess predation risk and other key ecological factors. A number of laboratory studies suggest that anthropogenic pollutants can disrupt chemoreception, even when at low, non-toxic concentrations, but there are few tests of whether real-world variation in water quality affects chemoreception. Here we investigate whether chemosensory perception of predators by the gray treefrog, Hyla versicolor, depends on water quality. We evaluated the anti-predator response of anuran tadpoles housed in water collected from three sites that represent strong contrasts in the concentration and types of dissolved solids: de-chlorinated tap water, water from an impaired stream, and treated wastewater effluent. Behavioral assays were conducted in laboratory aquaria. Chemical cues associated with predation were generated by feeding tadpoles to dragonfly predators held in containers, and then transferring aliquots of water from dragonfly containers to experimental aquaria. Tadpoles housed in tap water responded to predator cues with an activity reduction of 49%. Tadpoles housed in stream water and wastewater effluent responded to predator cues by reducing activity by 29% and 24% respectively. The results of factorial ANOVA support the hypothesis that the response to predator cues depended on water type. These results show that alteration of the chemical environment can mediate chemical perception of predators in aquatic ecosystems. Because most aquatic species rely on chemoreception to gather information on the location of food and predators, any impairment of sensory perception likely has important ecological consequences.","[Troyer, Rachael R.; Turner, Andrew M.] Clar Univ, Dept Biol, Clarion, PA 16214 USA","Turner, AM (corresponding author), Clar Univ, Dept Biol, Clarion, PA 16214 USA.",aturner@clarion.edu,,,US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0444939],"This work was funded by the US National Science Foundation, DEB-0444939.

Growth was strongly negatively density-dependent for both juveniles and subadults. We then used sediment of low organic content (loss on ignition 3.7 %) to test whether the density-dependence of growth was due to a direct crowding effect at high density, or mainly due to food limitation. Using an intermediate amphipod density (2800 ind. m(-2)) expected to give clear growth depression, we added baker's yeast as supplementary food at 6 levels corresponding to an input of 0 (control) to 147 g C m(-2) over an 8 wk period. The 3 highest yeast additions resulted in black, reduced sediment and elevated amphipod mortality in some replicates, but where the sediment did not become reduced, food additions enhanced growth significantly, demonstrating that growth depression at high density was primarily due to food limitation and not to crowding as such.","Univ Stockholm, Dept Syst Ecol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Stockholm, Asko Lab, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Elmgren, R (corresponding author), Univ Stockholm, Dept Syst Ecol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",ragnar_e@system.ecology.su.se,"Elmgren, Ragnar/A-1854-2013",,,,,54,18,18,0,5,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Although parasites are ubiquitous in these habitats and known agents of community structure, their impact on zonation is rarely considered. Here, using observational and experimental data, we show that parasitism of the cockle Austrovenus stutchburyi by echinostome trematodes has both direct and indirect effects on the zonation of four other animals associated with cockles on a New Zealand tidal flat. The trematodes encyst in the foot of cockles, leaving heavily infected cockles unable to bury and lying exposed on the sediment surface. Whereas cockle density peaks in the mid intertidal zone, both infection intensity by trematodes and density of surfaced cockles increase linearly towards the shore; this influences the vertical zonation of animals attaching to or feeding on cockles. First, the relative abundance of the whelk Cominella glandiformis increase exponentially shoreward, as does its rate of predation on cockles; the effect of the parasite on the cockles' burying ability has thus shifted the peak abundance of whelk predators towards the upper tidal level, away from peak cockle densities. Second, the density of the anemone Anthopleura aureoradiata, corrected for the availability of its cockle substrate, peaks in the lower intertidal zone, although a transplantation experiment revealed that anemones can survive higher up the shore if attached to buried cockles. Anemones on exposed cockles are susceptible to desiccation, and thus again the parasite-induced surfacing of cockles at higher tidal levels plays a role by decreasing substrate availability for anemones. Third, densities of the limpet Notoacmea helmsi increase rapidly toward higher tidal levels, where limpets graze the surfaces of empty cockle shells or live surfaced cockles. The availability of both substrates used by limpets is influenced either directly (surfaced cockles) or indirectly (empty shells, via whelk predation) by parasitism. Fourth, the fish Notolabrus celidotus feeds on cockles by cropping their foot. Although the lower intertidal is submerged for longer and cockle densities peak in the mid intertidal, the frequency of foot-cropping by fish peaks in the upper tidal levels, where parasitism maintains a high density of surfaced cockles. Our results are the first demonstration that parasitism of a key species can influence the zonation of non-host organisms, a phenomenon likely to occur in other systems.","Univ Aarhus, Inst Biol Sci, Dept Marine Ecol, DK-8200 Aarhus, Denmark; Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand","Mouritsen, KN (corresponding author), Univ Aarhus, Inst Biol Sci, Dept Marine Ecol, Finlandsgade 14, DK-8200 Aarhus, Denmark.",kim.mouritsen@biology.au.dk,"Poulin, Robert/C-3117-2008; Mouritsen, Kim N/K-6569-2013; Mouritsen, Kim N/N-3934-2014","Poulin, Robert/0000-0003-1390-1206; Mouritsen, Kim N/0000-0003-3564-8328; ",,,,37,22,22,0,38,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

The exposed sandy beach is an example of a physically rigorous environment where biological interactions have long been considered insignificant. We examined the interaction between the infaunal clam, Donax variabilis, and the hydroid, Lovenella gracilis, on exposed sandy beaches in North Carolina. Epibiotic occupation of Donax by hydroids has been repeatedly observed on ocean beaches but rarely investigated. By providing a stable substrate for attachment, the clam facilitates the persistence of the hydroid in the intertidal beach; however, benefits or costs experienced by the host as a result of this association are unknown. By exposing clams with and without hydroid colonies to multiple types of clam predators, we tested the effectiveness of the hydroid, which possesses stinging nematocysts, in defending its host. The hydroid defended the clam against one common predator, the Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus). Against speckled crabs (Arenaeus cribrarius) and ghost crabs (Ocypode quadrata), however, the hydroid offered no protection for its host and instead facilitated predation. The epibiotic hydroid, which projects above the surface of the sand, allowed the crabs to more readily detect clams below the surface. In the field, we evaluated the effect of the hydroid on the tidally synchronized migrations and bur-rowing speed of the clam. The hydroid, which can form large colonies on the posterior end of the clam, had no effect on Donax burrowing speed, but did reduce the speed of transport of clams by wave swash. Depending on relative predation pressure, the occupation of D. variabilis by L. gracilis can alternately be characterized as beneficial or detrimental to the host.","Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA","Manning, LM (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, 3431 Arendell St, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA.",,,,,,,61,19,22,1,12,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,FEB,2003,134,3,,,,,415,422,,10.1007/s00442-002-1134-y,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,657BG,WOS:000181645100016,12647150,,,,2021-09-27,

In a continuous cultivation system aiming at the planktonic calanoid Acartia tonsa an intruding harpacticoid frequently appears. We experimentally evaluate how the interaction from the semi-benthic Tisbe holothuriae is affecting our cultures and ask whether the two copepod-species are expected to pose competitive exclusion or co-exist long-term. This is pursued by establishing similar to 40days mono- and mixed copepod cultures reared in a stationary setup (S) theoretically advantageous for T.holothuriae and a rotating setup (R) with organisms kept in suspension by use of a plankton wheel, theoretically advantageous for A.tonsa. The carrying capacities of A.tonsa in either mono- or mixed cultures are not affected whether the copepods are subject to S or R treatment. Only exception is the S-setup containing mixed culture were A.tonsa obtains a significantly lower carrying capacity compared with A.tonsa alone in R-setup. The mono- and mixed cultures of T.holothuriae are, however, highly negatively affected by the R setup compared with S setup. A long-term solution to limit the presence of T.holothuriae is to apply turbulence level in a classical stagnant tank setup to an extend that suppress T.holothuriae and simultaneously allow algae in suspension as food for A.tonsa, make their eggs sediment as well as minimize risk of benthic-predation on eggs.","[Hansen, Benni W.; Boesen, Emil; Brodnicke, Ole B.; Corfixen, Natasja L.; Jepsen, Per M.; Larsen, Stephanie M.; Laessoe, Casper D.; Munch, Pernille S.; Nielsen, Peder K.

The prevalence of models lacking any trait dynamics has led to methods of identifying and measuring indirect effects that are not valid when phenotypically or evolutionarily plastic traits affect interspecific interactions. When traits are dynamic, the number of links in a dynamic model can no longer be used to distinguish direct and indirect effects, and classifying interactions by a single sign denoting effect on equilibrium density becomes problematic. The presence of trait dynamics also changes the interpretation of manipulative experiments that have been used to measure indirect effects. Because both traits and population densities can transmit indirect effects, a given ordered series of species will often transmit several indirect effects, which may have opposite signs. Because some traits can change very rapidly, dynamic equations describing population growth rates may often include the densities of species that interact indirectly with the given species. Some of the conceptual problems in comparing magnitudes of direct and indirect effects are illustrated by simple models of a three-species food chain. Different methods of measuring effect magnitudes can give different conditions for when direct effects are larger than indirect effects. Other terminology related to indirect effects, including interaction modification and higher-order interaction, is critically discussed. Given the present paucity of information about trait dynamics, it may be premature to attempt to compare magnitudes of direct and indirect effects.",,"ABRAMS, PA (corresponding author), UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV, 1987 UPPER BUFORD CIRCLE, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA.",,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008; Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X; ",,,,64,349,361,4,117,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Savanna ecosystems are defined largely by tree-grass mixtures, and tree establishment is a key driver of community structure and ecosystem function in these systems. The factors controlling savanna tree establishment are understudied, but likely involve some combination of seed, microsite and predator/fire limitation. In African savannas, suppression and killing of adult trees by large mammals like elephants (Loxodonta africana Blumenbach, 1797) and giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis Linnaeus, 1758) can maintain tree-grass co-dominance, although the impacts of even these conspicuous herbivores on tree establishment also are poorly understood. 2. We combined seed addition and predator exclusion experiments with a large-scale, long-term field manipulation of large herbivores to investigate the relative importance of seeds, microsites and predators in limiting establishment of a monodominant tree (Acacia drepanolobium Sjostedt) in a Kenyan savanna. 3. Both wild and domestic (i.e. cattle; Bos taurus Linnaeus, 1758) large herbivores facilitated tree establishment by suppressing abundances of rodents, the most important seed and seedling predators. However, this indirect, positive effect of wild herbivores was negated by wild herbivores' suppression of seed production. Cattle did not have this direct, negative impact; rather, they further assisted tree establishment by reducing cover of understorey grasses. Thus, the impacts of both groups of large herbivores on tree establishment were largely routed through other taxa, with a negligible net effect of wild herbivores and a positive net effect of cattle on tree establishment. 4. The distinction between the (positive) net effect of cattle and (neutral) net effect of wild herbivores is due to the inclusion of browsers and mixed feeders within the assemblage of wild herbivores. Browsing by wild herbivores limited seed production, which reduced tree recruitment; grazing by cattle was more pronounced than that by wild herbivores, and thus promoted germination and subsequent establishment of small trees. 5. Our study is the first to link seed fates to tree establishment in savanna ecosystems in experimentally-manipulated herbivore communities. Further, our results highlight how large herbivores can modify a suite of independent factors - seed production, competition with understorey species, and seed and seedling predation - to collectively drive tree establishment.","[Goheen, Jacob R.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Goheen, Jacob R.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Goheen, Jacob R.; Palmer, Todd M.; Riginos, Corinna; Young, Truman P.] Mpala Res Ctr, Nanyuki, Kenya; [Palmer, Todd M.] Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Keesing, Felicia] Bard Coll, Dept Biol, Annandale on Hudson, NY 12504 USA; [Riginos, Corinna] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Young, Truman P.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Goheen, JR (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",goheen@zoology.ubc.ca,,"Young, Truman/0000-0002-7326-3894; Palmer, Todd/0000-0001-5710-9750","American Society of Mammalogists; Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency STAR Program (JRG)United States Environmental Protection Agency; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0444741, DEB CAREER 0196177, BSR-97-07477, 03-16402, 08-16453]; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service","We thank Abdikadir Ali Hassan, Simon Lima and Jack Silange for phenomenal assistance in the field.

This is an ideal place for studying resource limitations because it avoids various complicating factors that are difficult to quantify but might affect animal densities, such as predation, interspecific competition, and past catastrophes. The relative group density was high in the coastal forest (0-400 m), while it did not differ among the higher zones (400-800, 800-1200 and 1200-1886 m). To examine this variation, three habitat variables were analyzed: total basal area of food trees per unit area, seasonal variations in fruit abundance, and total annual fleshy fruit production. All of these variables indicate that fruit and seeds are most available in the coastal forest. Thus, altitudinal variations in the density of Japanese macaques on Yakushima are determined by the total annual food abundance.","Kyoto Univ, Dept Zool, Grad Sch Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; Ryukoku Univ, Kyoto 6120021, Japan; Tonoji Terada, Inuyama, Aichi 4840094, Japan; Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, Hikone 5228533, Japan; Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr No Biosphere, Takaoka, Tomakomai 0530035, Japan; Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Gakuen, Sanda 6691337, Japan","Hanya, G (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Aichi 4848506, Japan.",hanya@pri.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Agetsuma, Naoki/A-4329-2012","Agetsuma, Naoki/0000-0003-4093-5276",,,,45,39,40,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

This study investigated phenotypic plasticity in growth, development, body size, and diapause in the yellow dung fly, Scathophaga stercoraria. Full-sib families were allowed to develop under predator-free field conditions. The time before the onset of winter was varied and each brood was split into three environments differing in the amount of dung a set number of larvae had as a resource. When resources were abundant and competition was minimal, individuals of both sexes grew to larger body sizes, took longer time to mature, and were able to increase their growth rates to attain large body sizes despite shorter effective development periods later in the season. In contrast, limited larval resources and strong competition constrained individuals to mature earlier at a smaller adult size, and growth rates could not be increased but were at least maintained. This outcome is predicted by only two life-history optimality models, which treat mortality due to long development periods and mortality due to fast growth as independent. Elevated preadult mortality indicated physiological costs of fast growth independent of predation. When larval resources were limited, mortality increased with heritable variation in development time for males, and toward the end of the season mortality increased as larval resources became more abundant because this induced longer development periods. Sexual and fecundity selection favoring large body size in this species is thus opposed by larval viability selection favoring slower growth in general and shorter development periods when time and resources are limited; this overall combination of selective pressures is presumably shaping the reaction norms obtained here. Flexible growth rates are facilitated by low genetic correlations between development time and body size, a possible consequence of selection for plasticity. Heritable variation was evident in all traits investigated, as well as in phenotypic plasticity of these traits (genotype x interactions). This is possibly maintained by unpredictable spatiotemporal variation in dung abundance, competition, and hence selection.","Univ Zurich Irchel, Museum Zool, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Blanckenhorn, WU (corresponding author), Univ Zurich Irchel, Museum Zool, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",wolfman@zoolmus.unizh.ch,,,,,,105,169,170,1,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,OCT,1998,52,5,,,,,1394,1407,,10.2307/2411309,,,14,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,137RZ,WOS:000076931100016,28565396,Bronze,,,2021-09-27,

Such information can also be useful to estimate natural mortality (M) for fish stock assessments and to evaluate the potential for competition between cetaceans and fisheries. In the present paper we provide estimates and confidence limits, taking into account sampling error, for consumption of fish by the four most common cetaceans along the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, while highlighting the uncertainties and biases inherent in the information presently available on energy requirements, diet and population size. We estimated that common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) consume around 6800(95% CI, 4871-9476) tons of sardine (Sardina pilchardus), 8800(6195-12,647) tons of gadids, 1100(721-1662) tons of hake (Merluccius merluccius) and 1900 (1222-2752) tons of scads (Trachurus sp.) annually. For striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), prey consumed were 900(196-2661) tons of sardine, 6200(3448-11,129) tons of gadids, 200 (11-504) tons of hake and 1600 (0-5318) tons of scads. Estimated amounts taken by harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are much lower, reflecting their low abundance in the area. Cetacean predation on sardine represents 2-8% of the current M value, indicating that cetaceans probably have little influence on sardine population dynamics. For the southern hake stock, estimated average removal by cetaceans often exceeds M. While this may indicate that both M and the consumption estimates for hake require revision it also suggests that cetaceans could have a more significant impact on hake populations. Different approaches to estimation of energy requirements of cetaceans can result in figures that differ by at least a factor of 2. The lack of good estimates of field metabolic rate for most species probably represents the most serious barrier to reliably quantifying the role of cetaceans in the ecosystem. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we explore the hypothesis that the sexual reproductive success of the invasive trees Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle and Robinia pseudoacacia L. is higher than that of the native Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl., all three species coexisting within the riparian forests of Central Spain. We compared different stages of the early life cycle, namely seed rain, seed infestation by insects, seed removal by local fauna, seed germination under optimal conditions and seedling abundance between the two invasive trees and the native, in order to assess their sexual reproductive success. The exotic species did not differ from the native reference (all three species displaying high seed rain and undergoing seed losses up to 50% due to seed removal by the local fauna). Even if the exotic R. pseudoacacia showed a high percentage of empty and insect-parasited seeds along with a low seedling emergence and the exotic A. altissima was the species with more viable seeds and of higher germinability, no differences were found regarding these variables when comparing them with the native F. angustifolia. Unsuitable conditions might have hampered either seedling emergence and survival, as seedling abundance in the field was lower than expected in all species - especially in R. pseudoacacia-. Our results rather suggest that the sexual reproductive success was not higher in the exotic trees than in the native reference, but studies focusing on long-term recruitment would help to shed light on this issue.","[Cabra-Rivas, Isabel; Castro-Diez, Pilar] Univ Alcala De Henares, Fac Biol Ciencias Ambientales & Quim, Dept Ciencias Vida, Unidad Docente Ecol, N-2,Km 33-6,POB 20, Madrid 28805, Spain","Cabra-Rivas, I (corresponding author), Univ Alcala De Henares, Fac Biol Ciencias Ambientales & Quim, Dept Ciencias Vida, Unidad Docente Ecol, N-2,Km 33-6,POB 20, Madrid 28805, Spain.",isabel.cabra@uah.es,"Castro-Diez, Pilar/L-4716-2014","Castro-Diez, Pilar/0000-0002-4841-5198","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2010-16388/BOS, CGL2015-65346-R]; Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La ManchaJunta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha [POII10-0179-4700]; Comunidad de MadridComunidad de Madrid [S-2013/MAE-2719, REMEDINAL3-CM MAE-2719]; Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport (FPU fellowship) [AP2010-1513]; Alcala University; Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y Deporte of Spain (FPU fellowship)German Research Foundation (DFG) [AP2010-1513]","This study was supported by the project CGL2010-16388/BOS and CGL2015-65346-R of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, POII10-0179-4700 of the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha and REMEDINAL network S-2013/MAE-2719 of the Comunidad de Madrid.

Caribbean parrotfishes prey upon multiple coral species but have particularly high rates of predation onOrbicella annularis, a major framework building coral and an endangered species. While some researchers have suggested that parrotfishes may have significant long-term impacts on heavily targeted species such asO. annularis, the patterns of coral recovery from parrotfish predation scars remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we tracked the fate of parrotfish bite scars onO. annulariscolonies across two Caribbean islands for up to 2 months. We evaluated differences in coral healing between islands in response to a number of variables including the initial scar surface area, scar abundance per coral colony, colony surface area, and water depth. We used these data to develop a predictive model ofO. annularistissue loss from recent parrotfish bite scars. We then applied this model to surveys of the distribution of bite scars at a point in time to estimate long-term tissue loss ofO. annulariscolonies from a standing stock of bite scars. Our findings suggest that the initial scar surface area is one of the most important predictors of coral tissue loss. The data also indicate that there are thresholds in patterns of coral tissue regeneration: we observed that small scars (<= 1.25 cm(2)) often fully heal, while larger scars (>= 8.2 cm(2)) had minimal tissue regeneration. The vast majority of observed scars (similar to 87%) were 1.25 cm(2)or less, and our model predicted thatO. annulariscolonies would regenerate nearly all the corresponding scar area. In contrast, while scars greater than or equal to 8.2 cm(2)were infrequent (similar to 6% of all observed scars), our model predicted that these larger scars would account for over 96% of the total tissue loss for grazed colonies. Overall, our results suggest that the immediate negative impacts of parrotfish predation on coral tissue loss appear to be driven primarily by a few exceptionally large bite scars. While further work is needed to understand the long-term impacts of corallivory and quantify the net impacts of parrotfish herbivory and corallivory on Caribbean coral reefs, this study is an important step in addressing factors that impact the recovery of a heavily targeted and ecologically important Caribbean coral from parrotfish predation.","[Rempel, Hannah S.; Ruttenberg, Benjamin, I] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Biol Sci Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Bodwin, Kelly N.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Stat Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Ruttenberg, Benjamin, I] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Ctr Coastal Marine Sci, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA","Rempel, HS (corresponding author), Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Biol Sci Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",hannah.rempel@gmail.com,"Rempel, Hannah Sima/AAU-2391-2021; Ruttenberg, Benjamin/D-2556-2012","Rempel, Hannah Sima/0000-0002-9464-6982; Bodwin, Kelly/0000-0003-3041-1786; Ruttenberg, Benjamin/0000-0001-7874-1915","NOAA Coral Reef Conservation ProgramNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA16NOS4820050]; California State University Council on Ocean Affairs, Science & Technology (CSU COAST); Dr. Earl H.

We used a multi-tissue stable isotope approach to investigate the trophic ecology of common reef predators in the central Great Barrier Reef of Australia. Our study revealed significant trophic separation among reef predators, especially when considering isotopic data from muscle, a slower turnover tissue. Based on muscle data, the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas, a large wide-ranging coastal species, occupied a higher trophic position and had a larger isotopic niche breadth (19.1 parts per thousand(2)) relative to smaller predators, including resident sharks (4.5 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand(2)) and large-bodied teleosts (4.4 +/- 1.8 parts per thousand(2)). Spanish mackerel Scomberomorus commerson and bull sharks had the largest unique total areas of isotopic niche space (expressed as a percentage) that did not overlap with any other species, 95% and 69.4 %, respectively, which means they had lower isotopic overlap. In general, faster turnover tissues such as whole blood and plasma showed higher isotopic overlap and smaller niche breadth for all reef predators. These results suggest that bull sharks use similar prey resources to large and small resident predators, at least during short periods. Our findings highlight the importance of investigating dietary changes in faster-turnover tissues of reef predators, particularly large wide-ranging species, which may have key roles in coral reef food webs through direct predation and competition.","[Espinoza, Mario; Tobin, Andrew J.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Espinoza, Mario; Tobin, Andrew J.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Espinoza, Mario] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Espinoza, Mario] Univ Costa Rica, Ctr Invest Ciencias Mar & Limnol, San Jose 206011501, Costa Rica; [Espinoza, Mario] Univ Costa Rica, Escuela Biol, San Jose 206011501, Costa Rica; [Matley, Jordan; Fisk, Aaron T.] Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9B 304, Canada; [Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia","Espinoza, M (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.; Espinoza, M (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.; Espinoza, M (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.; Espinoza, M (corresponding author), Univ Costa Rica, Ctr Invest Ciencias Mar & Limnol, San Jose 206011501, Costa Rica.; Espinoza, M (corresponding author), Univ Costa Rica, Escuela Biol, San Jose 206011501, Costa Rica.",mario.espinoza_m@ucr.ac.cr,"Espinoza, Mario/AAV-3460-2020","Espinoza, Mario/0000-0002-8355-2411","Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program (Tropical Ecosystems Hub)Australian Government [6.1]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [FT100101004]; Canada Research Chair programCanada Research Chairs; PADI Foundation; Australian Endeavour ScholarshipAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science; AIMS@JCU Scholarship","This research was conducted under research permits from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (G10/33754.1 and G10/33758.1) and Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries permit number 144482.

While there is some evidence that disturbed communities may resist trampling because of species shifts, we lack an understanding of how previous disturbance interacts with trampling in monospecific stands. Furthermore, recent studies emphasized experimental trampling additions with assumed ecological realism. We monitored barnacle cover in unmanipulated and experimentally disturbed plots at 2 sites separated by only 300 m and with disparate levels of human visitation. During the summer, barnacle cover increased by 6 and 15% at the less-visited site but decreased by 5 and 4% at the heavily visited site (unmanipulated and disturbed plots, respectively). Interestingly, the influence of site on barnacle cover was greater in disturbed than in unmanipulated plots. New recruits represented a greater proportion of the barnacles at the heavily visited site. Neither plot slope nor predator abundance differed between these sites. To isolate the influence of trampling on barnacles, we monitored barnacle cover in caged, human exclusion plots and in uncaged controls at both sites. Summer barnacle cover increased in all treatments except in uncaged plots at the heavily visited site. During 9 paired surveys coinciding with the exclusion experiment, as many as 70 humans (km(-1) shoreline h(-1)) entered the intertidal zone of the heavily visited site but no one did so at the less-visited site. Given that (1) visitation was the dominant factor explaining differences in barnacle cover between the 2 sites, and (2) caging enhanced barnacle cover only at the heavily visited site, we conclude that previous disturbance mediated the effects of human trampling on barnacle populations, with more disturbed plots displaying greater trampling vulnerability.","[Long, Jeremy D.; Dolecal, R.

In this experiment, interactions among ants (Formica montana Wheeler; Hymenoptera: Formicidae), aphids (Myzus persicae [Sulzer]; Hemiptera: Aphididae), lepidopteran eggs (Pieris rapae [L.]; Lepidoptera: Pieridae), and lady beetles (Coleomegilla maculata DeGeer; Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) were examined on canola (Brassica napus L.; Brassicales: Brassicaceae) to determine whether aphids mediate interactions between ants and eggs and if aphid-tending ants will protect these species from predation by the lady beetles. The first trial examined how ant attendance affected aphid and egg survival over 72 h when these herbivores were present on their own or in combination. The second trial examined these same interactions when a lady beetle was included in the system. Ants consumed significantly more aphids when this prey was offered alone than when eggs were offered alongside. When lady beetles were present, ants did not consume aphids. Ants and lady beetles consumed nearly all of the eggs regardless of whether aphids were present or not. When a lady beetle was absent, ant attendance increased significantly, but only when eggs and aphids were present in the system together. Ants visited the aphids less frequently when a lady beetle was present in the system, possibly due to increased competition. This trend was consistent over time in all treatments. All of this suggests that ants can be an important source of pest management of other herbivores (and even of the aphids that they are attending) but that these interactions are mediated by whether an additional predator is present within the system.","[Layman, Marissa L.; Lundgren, Jonathan G.] ARS, USDA, North Cent Agr Res Lab, 2923 Medary Ave, Brookings, SD 57006 USA; [Layman, Marissa L.] S Dakota State Univ, Biol Microbiol Dept, Brookings, SD 57007 USA","Lundgren, JG (corresponding author), ARS, USDA, North Cent Agr Res Lab, 2923 Medary Ave, Brookings, SD 57006 USA.",jgl.entomology@gmail.com,,,,,,63,1,1,1,11,GEORGIA ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC INC,TIFTON,"PO BOX 748 DEPT ENTOMOLOGY COASTAL PLAIN EXPT STATION, TIFTON, GA 31793-0748 USA",0749-8004,,,J ENTOMOL SCI,J.

The phase-spatial pattern of label indicated that most species, notably fish and shrimps, were territorial with a radius of movement rarely exceeding 1 m; while chironomids and other microfauna are virtually stationary. From the distribution of labelled individuals within the litter bank and the gradual buildup of label it seems the fish feed within the same small area over periods of several weeks. The appearance of label in the shrimps was more erratic. The P-32 appeared to be firmly retained within the living cells throughout the experiment and passed via the foodchains previously established by analysis of gut contents.

Aedes albopictus (Skuse), Aedes japonicus (Theobald), and Culex pipiens L. are invasive mosquitoes in North America, and their larvae are prey for the native mosquito predator, Toxorhynchites rutilus (Coquillett). Ae. albopictus and Ae. japonicus are recent invaders, whereas Cx. pipiens has been in the United States for >100 yr. In the presence of predation-risk cues from Tx. rutilus larvae, Cx. pipiens larvae increased the time spent resting at the surface (least risky behavior) more than the other prey species. Ae. japonicus larvae increased resting at the surface of the containers more than Ae. albopictus larvae in the presence of predation-risk cues. Cx. pipiens larvae spent more time motionless at the surface even in the absence of predation-risk cues when compared with the other species, indicating that Cx. pipiens larvae are the least vulnerable prey. As compared with the other prey species, Ae. albopictus larvae exhibited more high-risk behaviors both in the presence and absence of predation-risk cues, indicating that they are the most vulnerable prey. Ae. albopictus is the superior competitor; however, predation by Tx. rutilus larvae may prevent competitive exclusion by Ae. albopictus and promote coexistence among the three prey species.","[Kesavaraju, Banugopan; Khan, Daanish F.; Gaugler, Randy] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Vector Biol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Kesavaraju, B (corresponding author), Salt Lake City Mosquito Abatement Dist, 2020 N Redwood Rd, Salt Lake City, UT 84116 USA.",banu@slcmad.org,"Gaugler, Randy/K-3898-2013",,New Jersey Agricultural and Experimental Station [D-08-08193-04-11],We thank Linda McCuiston for providing Ae. japonicus egg papers and help with colony maintenance; Heather Evans and Emilie Cameron for help with the experiment; Ary Farajollahi and Kavitha Damal for providing comments to improve the manuscript; and Mercer County Mosquito Control for help with Tx. rutilus colony.

Here, a set of subarctic lakes along a diversifying gradient of coregonids was used as the natural setting to explore correlations between gill raker numbers and planktivory as well as the impact of coregonid radiation on zooplankton communities. Results from 19 populations covering most of the total gill raker number gradient of the genus Coregonus, confirm that the number of gill rakers has a central role in determining the foraging ability towards zooplankton prey. Both at the individual and population levels, gill raker number was correlated with pelagic niche use and the size of utilized zooplankton prey. Furthermore, the average body size and the abundance and diversity of the zooplankton community decreased with the increasing diversity of coregonids. We argue that zooplankton feeding leads to an eco-evolutionary feedback loop that may further shape the gill raker morphology since natural selection intensifies under resource competition for depleted prey communities. Eco-evolutionary interactions may thus have a central role creating and maintaining the divergence of coregonid morphs in postglacial lakes.","[Kahilainen, Kimmo K.] Univ Helsinki, Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn, Kilpisjarvi 99490, Finland; [Kahilainen, Kimmo K.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Siwertsson, Anna; Gjelland, Karl O.; Knudsen, Rune; Bohn, Thomas; Amundsen, Per-Arne] Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Bohn, Thomas] GenOk Ctr Biosafety, N-9294 Tromso, Norway","Kahilainen, KK (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn, Kasivarrentie 14622, Kilpisjarvi 99490, Finland.",kimmo.kahilainen@helsinki.fi,"Gjelland, Karl/I-7023-2012","Gjelland, Karl/0000-0003-4036-4207; Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; Bohn, Thomas/0000-0002-3851-9313; Amundsen, Per-Arne/0000-0002-2203-8216","Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; Municipality of Inari; Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish Cultural Foundation; Ella and Georg Ehrnrooth Foundation; Otto A.

To test this hypothesis, two field experiments were conducted using Allium vineale. The first experiment involved both sexual and asexual propagules (seed- and bulbil-derived progeny, respectively) that were surrounded by either no neighbors, related neighbors, or unrelated neighbors at a distance of 2 cm. After 2 yr, target plants without neighbors had the largest dry bulb weights, which indicates that competition had occurred in the other treatments. Contrary to my prediction, plants had higher survival rates when surrounded by more closely related neighbors. In the second experiment, target plants were surrounded by identical asexually produced bulbils or by bulbils from unrelated individuals, at two densities and with five specific genotype combinations replicated in three blocks. Three of the genotype combinations showed no effect of any of the neighbor treatments. For the other two genotype combinations, target plants at high densities surrounded by genetically identical neighbors outperformed plants surrounded by unrelated neighbors. This result was again contrary to predictions and indicated that positive frequency-dependent selection may occur among siblings. This may be one mechanism favoring asexual reproduction in Allium vineale.","DUKE UNIV, DEPT BOT, DURHAM, NC 27706 USA",,,,,,,,65,30,32,1,10,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Generally, coral reefs shelter more invertebrate prey but also harbor more predators compared to vegetated areas. To avoid predation, many juvenile fish may select lower-risk vegetated areas rather than coral reefs. Very little information is known about habitat selection by juvenile fish if coral reefs have similar predation rates as vegetated areas. In this study, we quantified the density, diet, survival rate, and food availability of four reef fish species (Lethrinus harak, L. obsoletus, Lutjanus gibbus, and Parupeneus indicus) as well as predator and competitor density within a low-predation lagoon containing bare sand, coral reefs, and seagrass beds. The results showed that the two lethrinids used seagrass beds as primary habitats as small juveniles. Large juveniles of L. obsoletus (5 cm total length after dietary shift) and most juvenile L. gibbus preferred coral reefs. P. indicus were dietary generalists in most habitats. Overall, these instances of ontogenetic habitat selection may be related to variations in diet in each species. We also found that predation rates were extremely low (<30 %) in both coral and seagrass habitats and that coral reefs sheltered higher invertebrate prey densities (80 ind m(-2)) than did seagrass beds (30 ind m(-2)) and bare sand (<10 ind m(-2)). We hypothesized that competition is a factor potentially affecting habitat selection by juvenile reef fish, as more competitor fish inhabited coral reefs. Fish optimize the advantages of particular habitats for growth and for avoiding competition by selecting ideal habitats under conditions of low predation.","[Lee, Chen-Lu; Lin, Hsing-Juh] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Lee, Chen-Lu; Lin, Hsing-Juh] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Res Ctr Global Change Biol, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Lin, Hsing-Juh] Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 115, Taiwan","Lin, HJ (corresponding author), Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taichung 402, Taiwan.",hjlin@dragon.nchu.edu.tw,,"Lin, Hsing-Juh/0000-0001-8322-7195","Kenting National Park Headquarters; National Science Council of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC101-2625-M-005-004]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U1405234]","We thank Yi-Li Chuang and Chen-Yun Lee for field assistance and Laurie Battle for proofreading the manuscript.

Timber harvesting has led to a significant increase in moose (Alces americanus) densities and has triggered numerical and functional predator responses. Moose are now frequently observed at higher altitudes in preferential caribou habitat. Despite extensive range overlap between these two species across Canada, few studies have precisely assessed the potential role of exploitative competition. We assessed the potential overlap between their diets during summer, a key period for energy and nutrient acquisition in cervids. We collected faeces from both species along an altitudinal gradient (200m-1250m asl) and used plant chloroplast barcoding sequence trnL to reconstruct diet at the species level. Plant species composition differed between caribou and moose samples, with cervid species explaining 40% of the variation in dissimilarity. We noted slight variations in dissimilarity between species between months and along an altitudinal gradient. Some species that are almost exclusively eaten by moose (speckled alder, wild redcurrant) or by caribou (common juniper, common horsetail) contributed the most to the dissimilarity between diets. The potential for food competition appears relatively low, even at increased moose densities, possibly as a result of past competition. This separation in food niche could also be explained by an imperfect segregation of species since the proportion of time spent in different strata of altitude is unequal. High moose densities thus appear to be more harmful to caribou due to shared predators, but a low level of competition for a few food items could contribute to the decline of this endangered population if some caribou are nutritionally stressed.

FC and FS abilities to survive were determined by field sampling and experimental treatments of laboratory stream models. The effects of interspecific competition, antagonism, and predation on FC and FS survivals were determined using recirculating models that contained either untreated drain water and sediment, cycloheximide-treated drain sediment, or autoclaved drain water and sediment seeded with drain isolates of FC and FS. Storm drain sediment FC and FS counts were stable at 10(5)/100 ml during dry weather (4-6 days), with little or no bacterial supplementation from the water (10(1)-10(2)/100 ml). Untreated (control) model FC and FS populations stabilized at 10(3)/100 ml for 7-9 days. In cycloheximide-treated models, FS and FC survived at 10(4) and 10(5)/100 ml, respectively. In autoclaved-seeded models, FS and FC initial counts of 10(4)/100 ml increased to and stabilized at 10(7)-10(9)/100 ml. Separate storm drain sediments serve as reservoirs of high concentrations of FC and FS during warm, dry weather periods. FC exhibited some ability to multiply in drain sediment. Native microfloral competition/antagonism (including bacterial predation) and protozoan predation are major biotic factors influencing FC and FS survivals. During warm, dry weather periods, abiotic factors were generally stable and had minimal affects on FC and FS survivals.","UNIV MICHIGAN,SCH PUBL HLTH,DEPT ENVIRONM & IND HLTH,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109",,,,,,,,62,67,69,1,12,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB",0043-1354,,,WATER RES,Water Res.,SEP,1991,25,9,,,,,1089,1098,,10.1016/0043-1354(91)90202-2,,,10,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,GF854,WOS:A1991GF85400008,,Green Published,,,2021-09-27,

Indeed, this has been demonstrated in many theoretical studies on predator-prey dynamics. In virtually all of these studies, the stabilization role is demonstrated as a weakening of the paradox of enrichment. With predator interference, stable limit cycles that appear as a result of environmental enrichment occur for higher values of the environmental carrying capacity of prey, and even a complete absence of the limit cycles can happen. Here we study predator-prey dynamics using the Rosenzweig-MacArthur-like model in which the Holling type II functional response has been replaced by a predator-dependent family which generalizes many of the commonly used descriptions of predator interference. By means of a bifurcation analysis we show that sufficiently strong predator interference may bring about another stabilizing mechanism. In particular, hysteresis combined with (dis)appearance of stable limit cycles imply abrupt increases in both the prey and predator densities and enhanced persistence and resilience of the predator-prey system. We encourage refitting the previously collected data on predator consumption rates as well as for conducting further predation experiments to see what functional response from the explored family is the most appropriate.","[Pribylova, Lenka] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Math & Stat, Sect Appl Math, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic; [Berec, Ludek] Biol Ctr ASCR, Inst Entomol, Dept Biosystemat & Ecol, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Berec, Ludek] Univ South Bohemia, Inst Math & Biomath, Fac Sci, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic","Pribylova, L (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Math & Stat, Sect Appl Math, Kotlarska 2, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic.",pribylova@math.muni.cz,"Pribylova, Lenka/Q-9683-2019; Berec, Ludek/G-7253-2014; Pribylova, Lenka/AAD-7363-2019","Pribylova, Lenka/0000-0002-9027-4333; Berec, Ludek/0000-0002-2419-3324; ",project Univerzitni vyuka matematiky v menicim se svete [CZ.1.07/2.2.00/15.0203];  [RVO:60077344],LP acknowledges support from the project CZ.1.07/2.2.00/15.0203 Univerzitni vyuka matematiky v menicim se svete.

We tested this idea with an epidemiological experiment in which we simulated variable levels of size-selective predation on zooplankton hosts and monitored the persistence of host and parasite populations. In the absence of simulated predation, the virulent protozoan Caullerya mesnili frequently drove its host Daphnia galeata to extinction. Uninfected control populations showed lower extinction rates and higher average densities than infected populations in the absence of simulated predation (all of the latter went extinct or remained infected). With a weak removal rate of the largest hosts, the proportion of populations in which the parasite drove the host to extinction decreased, while the number of populations in which the host persisted and the parasite went extinct increased. Host-parasite coexistence was also observed in some cases. With intermediate levels of removal, most of the parasite populations went extinct, while the host populations persisted. With an even higher removal rate, Daphnia were driven to extinction as well. Thus, variation in one factor, size-selective mortality, resulted in four different patterns of population dynamics. Our results highlight the potential role of predation in shaping the epidemiology and community structure of host-parasite systems.","Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Jyvaskyla, Finland; Univ Basel, Inst Zool, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland","Pulkkinen, K (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, Jyvaskyla, Finland.",pukaan@bytl.jyu.fi,"Ebert, Dieter/B-5502-2009","Ebert, Dieter/0000-0003-2653-3772; Pulkkinen, Katja/0000-0002-1480-2464",,,,47,9,9,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2006,149,1,,,,,72,80,,10.1007/s00442-006-0433-0,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,081SY,WOS:000240338500008,16685511,,,,2021-09-27,

In a whole-lake experiment covering 5 years, we added the intermediate consumer roach (Rutilus rutilus) to two out of four lakes previously inhabited by the omnivorous top predator perch (Perca fluviatilis). We focused our study on the direct consumption effect of roach presence on zooplankton (and indirectly phytoplankton) versus the indirect effect of roach on zooplankton (and phytoplankton) mediated via effects on perch reproductive performance. The patterns in zooplankton and phytoplankton abundances were examined in relation to population density of roach and perch including young-of-the-year (YOY) perch in the light of non-equilibrium dynamics. The presence of roach resulted in changed seasonal dynamics of zooplankton with generally lower biomasses in May-June and higher biomasses in July-August in roach lakes compared to control lakes. Roach presence affected perch recruitment negatively and densities of YOY perch were on average higher in control lakes than in treatment lakes. In years when perch recruitment did not differ between lakes as a result of experimental addition of perch eggs, total zooplankton biomass was lower in treatment lakes than in control lakes. Phytoplankton biomass showed a tendency to increase in roach lakes compared to control lakes. Within treatment variation in response variables was related to differences in lake morphometry in treatment lakes. Analyses of the trophic dynamics of each lake separately showed strong cascading effects of both roach and YOY perch abundance on zooplankton and phytoplankton dynamics. Consideration of the long transients in the dynamics of top predators (fish) in aquatic systems that are related to their long life span involving ontogenetic niche shifts is essential for making relevant interpretations of experimental perturbations. This conclusion is further reinforced by the circumstance that the intrinsic dynamics of fish populations may in many cases involve high amplitude dynamics with long time lags.","Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden","Persson, L (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",lennart.persson@eg.umu.se,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012",,,,,68,19,19,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2004,106,2,,,,,263,274,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12767.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,834QC,WOS:000222424600006,,,,,2021-09-27,

Tanks holding one, two and four fish were video-taped continuously before and after introduction of an olfactory cue and whole baits (squid). Pre-cue indices of activity did not vary with fish density. After olfactory stimulation, per capita activity was directly related to density, with no significant increase in activity by single fish. Numbers of baits located, attacked and consumed were directly related to fish density, and average times to first attack varied from 12 s in groups of four fish to >15 min in single fish. The latency period between location and attack decreased significantly with fish density. When large (43-55cm, total length, L-T) and small (31-38 cm L-T) Pacific halibut were tested together in pairs and groups of four fish, small individuals located baits first in 61% of the trials. Large fish, however, consumed all of the baits (except one) in trials where both large and small fish responded. Social facilitation in Pacific halibut feeding will result in a non-linear relationship between catch per unit effort and population density, and the size composition of fish captured may be influenced by interference competition.

When spatial structure prevents the populations from being well mixed, such predators may have a selective disadvantage because they do not make full use of the prey's growth capacity and hence produce fewer propagules. The best strategy then depends on the degree to which predators can monopolize the exploitation of local prey populations, which in turn depends on the spatial structure, the number of migrants, and, in particular, the stochastic nature of the colonization process. To analyze the evolutionary dynamics of predators in a spatially structured predator-prey system, we performed simulations with a metapopulation model that has explicit local dynamics of nonpersistent populations, keeps track of the number of emigrants entering the migration pool, assumes individuals within local populations as well as within the migration pool to be well mixed, and takes stochastic colonization into account. We investigated which of the predator's exploitation strategies are evolutionarily stable and whether these strategies minimize the overall density of prey, as is the case in Lotka-Volterra-type models of competitive exclusion. This was analyzed by pairwise invasibility plots based on short-term simulations and tested by long-term simulation experiments of competition between resident and mutant predator-types that differed in one of the following parameters: the prey-to-predator conversion efficiency, the per capita prey consumption rate, or the per capita emigration rate from local populations. In addition, we asked which of these three strategies are most likely to evolve. Our simulations showed that under selection for conversion efficiency the predator-prey system always goes globally extinct yet persists under selection for consumption or emigration rates and that the evolutionarily stable (ES) exploitation strategies do not maximize local population growth rates. The most successful exploitation strategy minimizes the overall density of prey but does not make it settle exactly at the minimum. The system did not settle at the point where the mean time to co-invasion (i.e., immigration of a second predator in a local prey population) equals the mean local interaction time (an idea borne out from studies on host exploitation strategies in host-pathogen systems) but rather where the mean time to co-invasion was larger. The ES exploitation strategies represent more prudent strategies than the ones that minimize prey density. Finally, we show that-compared to consumption-emigration is a more likely target for selection to achieve prudent exploitation and that prudent exploitation strategies can evolve only provided the prey-to-predator conversion efficiency is subject to constraints.","Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands","Sabelis, MW (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, POB 94084, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",sabelis@science.uva.nl,"De Roos, Andre M./A-1590-2008","De Roos, Andre M./0000-0002-6944-2048",,,,50,21,22,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

We tested for density dependent nest predation at a site dominated by predation from raccoons, Procyon lotor, and blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata. We used cohorts of 20 artificial ground nests placed on experimental grids at four densities (1.7, 7, 65, and 167 nests/ha). Predation was density dependent for one of two temporal replicates. In a second experiment, we tested for density dependent predation on both ground and shrub nests using more realistic nest densities (3.5 and 8.9 nests/ha) and excluding avian and small mammal predators by placing nylon screening over the nests. Predation was density dependent on artificial ground nests and density independent on shrub nests. Finally, we analyzed predation on natural shrub nests separating out avian (i.e., jays) and large mammalian predation based on disturbance to the depredated nest. In each of three years there was no evidence for density dependent predation. An outbreak of periodic cicadas in the first experiment and the maturation of a large mulberry crop during the second experiment demonstrated the importance of the distribution and abundance of alternative foods on the response of predators toward heterogeneity in nest abundance.","Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Wilmington, IL 60481 USA","Schmidt, KA (corresponding author), Inst Ecosyst Studies, Box AB,Route 44A, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA.",thatseasy@aol.com,"Whelan, Christopher J/H-4856-2019","Whelan, Christopher J/0000-0001-7511-2603",,,,73,80,81,1,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1999,87,1,,,,,65,74,,10.2307/3546997,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,248AG,WOS:000083252700007,,,,,2021-09-27,

We conducted an experiment in oval flow-through artificial-stream tanks to examine the single and interactive sublethal effects of brook trout and stoneflies on the size at emergence of Baetis bicaudatus (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae), and the cascading trophic effects on algal biomass, the food resource of the mayflies. No predation was allowed in the experiment, so that all effects were mediated through predator modifications of prey behaviour. We reared trout stream Baetis larvae from just before egg development until emergence in tanks with four treatments: (1) water from a holding tank with two brook trout (trout odour), (2) no trout odour + eight stoneflies with glued mouthparts, (3) trout odour + stoneflies and (4) no trout odour or stoneflies. We ended the experiment after 3 weeks when ten male and ten female subimagos had emerged from each tank, measured the size of ten male and ten female mature nymphs (with black wing pads), and collected algal samples from rocks at six locations in each tank. To determine the mechanism responsible for sublethal and cascading effects on lower trophic levels we made day and night observations of mayfly behaviour for the first 6 days by counting mayflies drifting in the water column and visible on natural substrata in the artificial streams. Trout odour and stoneflies similarly reduced the size of male and female Baetis emerging from artificial streams, with non-additive effects of both predators. While smaller females are less fecund, a fitness cost of small male size has not been determined. The mechanism causing sublethal effects on Baetis differed between predators. While trout stream Baetis retained their nocturnal periodicity in all treatments, stoneflies increased drift dispersal of mayflies at night, and trout suppressed night-time feeding and dr:ift of mayflies. Stoneflies had less effect on Baetis behaviour when fish odour was present. Thus, we attribute the non-additivity of effects of fish and stoneflies on mayfly growth to an interaction modification whereby trout odour reduced the impact of stoneflies on Baetis behaviour. Since stonefly activity was also reduced in the presence of fish odour, this modification may be attributed to the effect of fish odour on stonefly behaviour. Only stoneflies delayed Baetis emergence, suggesting that stoneflies had a greater sublethal effect on Baetis fitness than did trout. Delayed emergence may reduce Baetis fitness by increasing risks of predation and parasitism on larvae, and increasing competition for mates or oviposition sites among adults. Finally, algal biomass was higher in tanks with both predators than in the other three treatments. These data implicate a behavioural trophic cascade because predators were not allowed to consume prey. Therefore, differences in algal biomass were attributed to predator-induced changes in mayfly behaviour. Our study demonstrates the importance of considering multiple predators when measuring direct sublethal effects of predators on prey fitness and indirect effects on lower trophic levels. Identification of an interaction modification illustrates the value of obtaining detailed information on behavioural mechanisms as an aid to understanding the complex interactions occurring among components of ecological communities.","Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA","Peckarsky, BL (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",BLP1@cornell.edu,"Langerhans, R.

Size at metamorphosis decreased significantly with increases in the density of surviving tadpoles, but it decreased at a significantly faster rate in the shallower tanks.

We hypothesized that alterations in detritus availability because of enrichment would decrease the abundance and biomass of large-bodied consumers. In contrast, we found that 2 yr of enrichment increased the biomass and abundance of all consumers regardless of body size. Furthermore, during the fourth and fifth year of enrichment, the abundance and biomass of large-bodied primary consumers continued to increase, while small-bodied primary consumers returned to pretreatment levels. The size structure of a dominant primary consumer (Pycnopsyche spp.) also shifted during the 5-yr enrichment: its average and maximum individual body size increased in the treatment stream compared with the reference stream. Positive enrichment effects also occurred on small-bodied predators, but not on large-bodied predators. Thus, enrichment increased prey body size, but these positive effects on large prey did not propagate up to higher trophic levels to affect large predators. Because consumer body size can be an important species-specific trait determining population dynamics and ecosystem processes, these observed shifts in consumer size distributions suggest a potentially important pathway for global increases in nutrient enrichment to alter stream structure and function.","[Davis, John M.; Rosemond, Amy D.; Cross, Wyatt F.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Wallace, J.

Moreover, until weeds reach a point where they threaten yield or approach seed production, they can increase biodiversity and provision food and habitat to attract predatory insects. In two related field experiments, we quantified impacts of weed presence and diversity on pests, predators, and biocontrol of both weed seeds and insect prey. We also measured yields of two vegetables that vary in competitiveness (eggplants and turnips) across two weed management treatments (weedy and weed-free), to determine productivity costs of tolerating weeds. Allowing weeds to grow adjacent to rows of eggplants increased abundances of predators and reduced pests. Surprisingly, relaxing weed management came at no cost to eggplant yield. In contrast, tolerating weeds in turnips had strong yield costs, and did not benefit predators or decrease pest pressure. On both crops, pests declined as weed diversity increased. Yet, weed treatments had no impact on consumption of weed seeds or sentinel prey by soil-surface insects, which were dominated by red imported fire ants. Our results suggest that highly competitive crops might benefit from stronger natural pest control when weeds are less-aggressively managed. However, herbivores and predators had unique responses to weeds that were crop-specific. To help farmers allocate limited weed management labor resources, future work should examine the relative competitiveness of a wider variety of vegetables over a gradient of weed pressure while measuring corresponding impacts on pest control.","[Madden, Melina K.; Blubaugh, Carmen K.] Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Widick, Ivy, V] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Blubaugh, Carmen K.] Univ Georgia, Dept Entomol, Athens, GA 30601 USA","Blubaugh, CK (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.; Blubaugh, CK (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Entomol, Athens, GA 30601 USA.",carmen.blubaugh@uga.edu,,"Blubaugh, Carmen/0000-0002-4570-0727",South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics' SPRI program; South Carolina Department of Agriculture [2013023],"We are grateful to Andrew Godard, Charlette Aldebron, and Annie McElvenny for their assistance in the field, as well as Dave Robb and the staff at the Clemson Student Organic Farm.

In this work the allelopathic effects of Margalefidinium polykrikoides (= Cochlodinium polykrikoides) and Gymnodinium impudicum on Gymnodinium catenatum were evaluated. The allelopathic abilities of M. polykrikoides and G. impudicum were investigated in bi-algal culture experiments and in trials in which target species were co-cultured, separated by a 10 mu m membrane to prevent a direct cell-to-cell contact; and also by the addition of different volumes of culture media without cells. For all trials, cells of each species were harvested during exponential phase and cultured together by triplicate at three relative abundances: 1:1 (200 Cells mL(-1) of each species, G. catenatum and M. polykrikoides or G. impudicum), 2:1 (400 Cells mL(-1) of G. catenatum and 200 Cells mL(-1) of M. polykrikoides or G. impudicum), and 1:2 (200 cells mL(-1) of G. catenatum and 400 Cells mL(-1) of M. polykrikoides or G. impudicum). All bioassays were carried out by triplicate in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 150 mL of modified GSe medium with an initial inoculum of 200 or 400 Cells mL(-1). During experiments G. catenatum abundances were enumerated daily. In bi-algal culture experiments mortalities of G. catenatum were from 50% to 100% after 48 h of cell contact with M. polykrikoides or G. impudicum. In the case of culture media without cells, only M. polykrikoides caused a decrease in the cell abundance and growth rate of G. catenatum. Morphological changes occurred in G. catenatum when in contact with M. polykrikoides and G. impudicum, such as membrane shedding, prominent nucleus, loss of flagella, cell lysis, as well as the separation of long chains into individual cells. These results suggest that in the natural environment M. polykrikoides and G. impudicum have allelopathic interactions in G. catenatum, which could negatively affect its growth and survival, indicating that these species could displace blooms of G. catenatum.","[Band-Schmidt, Christine J.; Zumaya-Higuera, Miriam G.; Hernandez-Guerrero, Claudia J.] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas IPN CICIM, Apartado Postal 592, La Paz 23000, Bcs, Mexico; [Lopez-Cortes, David J.] Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste CIBNOR, Calle IPN 195, La Paz 23096, Bcs, Mexico; [Leyva-Valencia, Ignacio] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, CONACyT, Apartado Postal 592, La Paz 23000, Baja California, Mexico; [Quijano-Scheggia, Sonia, I] Univ Colima, Ctr Univ Invest Oceanol, Km 20 Carretera Manzanillo Barra Navida, Colima 28860, Mexico","Band-Schmidt, CJ (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas IPN CICIM, Apartado Postal 592, La Paz 23000, Bcs, Mexico.",cbands@ipn.mx,,,"PPACPlaneacion Ambiental y Conservacion-CIBNOR [SAPPI 2020-0571, PC0.11]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologiaConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [CONACyT-SEP 178227, FORDECyT 260040, 70023, 248468]; CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [703507]; BEIFI; RedFAN","We thank Dr. D.

The participants of the workshop are part of the European Network of Excellence MarBEF (Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function), a consortium of 56 European marine institutes to integrate and disseminate knowledge and expertise on marine biodiversity. Here we review some of the new trends and emerging topics in marine chemical ecology. The first section deals with microbial chemical interactions. Microbes communicate with each other using diffusible molecules such as N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHL). These are regulators in cell-density-dependent gene regulation (quorum sensing) controlling microbial processes. In chemical interactions with higher organisms, microbes can act either as harmful pathogens that are repelled by the host's chemical defense or as beneficial symbionts. These symbionts are sometimes the true producers of the host's secondary metabolites that have defensive and protective functions for their hosts. We also describe how allelochemicals can shape phytoplankton communities by regulating competition for available resources, and also interactions among individuals of the same species. Compounds such as the diatom-derived unsaturated aldehydes have been demonstrated to act as infochemicals, and they possibly function as a diffusible bloom-termination signal that triggers an active cell death and bloom termination at sea. The same molecules have also been shown to interfere with the reproductive capacity of grazing animals deterring future generations of potential predators. Such compounds differ from those that act as feeding deterrents since they do not target the predator but its offspring. Many of the neurotoxins produced by dinoflagellates act as feeding deterrents, and laboratory experiments have shown that ingestion of these algae by some microzooplankton and macrozooplankton can cause acute responses such as death, incapacitation, altered swimming behavior, and reduced fecundity and egg-hatching success. These effects may rarely occur in nature because of low individual grazing rates on dinoflagellate cells and grazing on other food sources such as microflagellates; and diatoms. We also consider the nutritional component of marine plant-herbivore interactions, especially in the plankton, and the information available on the effects of growing conditions of algae on the production of toxic metabolites. Species producing saxitoxins seem to consistently produce the highest amounts of toxins (on a per cell basis) in the exponential phase of growth, and there is a decrease in their production under nitrogen, but not under phosphorus stress, where the production actually increases. We try to explain the circumstances under which organisms defend themselves chemically and argue that the most likely explanatory model for the production of secondary metabolites used for defense in planktonic organisms is the carbon nutrient balance hypothesis, which predicts that most algae produce their toxins mainly under conditions where carbon is in excess and nitrogen (or other nutrients) is limiting. We also discuss chemically mediated macroalgal-herbivore interactions in the benthos and the large variation in concentration of seaweed defense metabolites at different spatial and temporal scales. Seaweeds have been shown to produce a large variety of secondary metablites with highly variable chemical structures such as terpenoids, acetogenins, amino acid derivates, and polyphenols. Many of these compounds probably have multiple simultaneous functions for the seaweeds and can act as allelopathic, antimicrobial, and antifouling or ultraviolet-screening agents, as well as herbivore deterrents. We also provide examples of interactions between marine benthic invertebrates, especially sponges, molluscs, and cnidarians, that are mediated by specific secondary metabolites and discuss the role of these in shaping benthic communities.","Stn Zool A Dohrn, I-80121 Naples, Italy; AWI Biol Anstalt Helgoland, D-27498 Helgoland, Germany; CNR, Ist Chim Biomol, I-800078 Naples, Italy; Max Planck Inst Marine Microbiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; Tjarno Marine Biol Lab, SE-45296 Stromstad, Sweden; CNRS, Biol Stn, F-29680 Roscoff, France","Ianora, A (corresponding author), Stn Zool A Dohrn, I-80121 Naples, Italy.",ianora@szn.it,"Toth, Gunilla B/E-8737-2013; Boersma, Maarten/A-5475-2013; Fontana, Angelo/C-3354-2012; Pavia, Henrik/G-2764-2013; Casotti, Raffaella/H-1697-2016; Ianora, Adrianna/O-3408-2019; Casotti, Raffaella/I-9833-2019; Fontana, Angelo/AAO-2741-2021","Boersma, Maarten/0000-0003-1010-026X; Fontana, Angelo/0000-0002-5453-461X; Casotti, Raffaella/0000-0002-9876-4601; Casotti, Raffaella/0000-0002-9876-4601; Fontana, Angelo/0000-0002-5453-461X; Toth, Gunilla/0000-0002-1225-7773",,,,197,88,98,2,160,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-2723,1559-2731,,ESTUAR COAST,Estuaries Coasts,AUG,2006,29,4,,,,,531,551,,10.1007/BF02784281,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,085KB,WOS:000240601900001,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2021-09-27,

The relationships between the activity time and frequency, biological factors (perceived predation risk, food resources, and species composition), and abiotic factors (temperature, air moisture, wind speed) were analysed using Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Our results showed that: (1) relative humidity mainly affected activities in the springtime; temperature, relative humidity and interspecific competition mainly affected activities in the summertime; relative humidity and perceived predation risk mainly influenced activities in the autumn. (2) The activity pattern of the Siberian jerboa altered depending on the season. The activity of the Siberian jerboa was found to be bimodal in spring and summer, and was trimodal in autumn. The activity time and frequency in autumn were significantly lower than the spring. (3) Animals possess the ability to integrate disparate sources of information about danger to optimize energy gain. The jerboa adapted different responses to predation risks and competition in different seasons according to the demand for food resources.","[Ji, Yu; Yuan, Shuai; Fu, Heping; Yang, Suwen; Bu, Fan; Li, Xin; Wu, Xiaodong] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Grassland Resources & Environm, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Ji, Yu; Yuan, Shuai; Fu, Heping; Yang, Suwen; Bu, Fan; Li, Xin; Wu, Xiaodong] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Rodent Res Ctr, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Ji, Yu; Yuan, Shuai; Fu, Heping; Yang, Suwen; Bu, Fan; Li, Xin; Wu, Xiaodong] Minist Educ, Key Lab Grassland Resources, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Fu, Heping] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hohhot, Peoples R China","Fu, HP; Wu, XD (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Grassland Resources & Environm, Hohhot, Peoples R China.; Fu, HP; Wu, XD (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Rodent Res Ctr, Hohhot, Peoples R China.; Fu, HP; Wu, XD (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Key Lab Grassland Resources, Hohhot, Peoples R China.; Fu, HP (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hohhot, Peoples R China.",fuheping@126.com; wuxiaodong_hgb@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [32060256, 32060395, 31772667]; Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia [2018MS03014, 2019MS03012]; Key Project of the Education Department of Inner Mongolia [NJZZ17055]; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Grassland Resources","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 32060256, 32060395, 31772667], the Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia [grant numbers 2018MS03014, 2019MS03012], the Key Project of the Education Department of Inner Mongolia [grant number NJZZ17055], and the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Grassland Resources.

However, contrary to terrestrial ecosystems, few habitat selection studies have been conducted at a fine scale for coastal marine top predator species, and fewer have coupled diet data with habitat selection modeling to highlight a link between prey selection and habitat use. The aim of this study was to characterize spatially and oceanographically, at a fine scale, the habitats used by the European Shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis in the Special Protection Area (SPA) of Houat-H oe dic in the Mor Braz Bay during its foraging activity. Habitat selection models were built using in situ observation data of foraging shags (transect sampling) and spatially explicit environmental data to characterize marine benthic habitats. Observations were first adjusted for detectability biases and shag abundance was subsequently spatialized. The influence of habitat variables on shag abundance was tested using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Diet data were finally confronted to habitat selection models. Results showed that European shags breeding in the Mor Braz Bay changed foraging habitats according to the season and to the different environmental and energetic constraints. The proportion of the main preys also varied seasonally. Rocky and coarse sand habitats were clearly preferred compared to fine or muddy sand habitats. Shags appeared to be more selective in their foraging habitats during the breeding period and the rearing of chicks, using essentially rocky areas close to the colony and consuming preferentially fish from the Labridae family and three other fish families in lower proportions. During the post-breeding period shags used a broader range of habitats and mainly consumed Gadidae. Thus, European shags seem to adjust their feeding strategy to minimize energetic costs, to avoid intra-specific competition and to maximize access to suitable habitats and preys.","[Michelot, Candice; Pinaud, David; Barbraud, Christophe] Univ La Rochelle, CNRS, UMR7372, CEBC, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Fortin, Matthieu; Callard, Benjamin; Leicher, Marine] Bretagne Vivante SEPNB, Reserve Nat Marais Sene, Route Brouel, F-56860 Sene, France; [Maes, Philippe] Univ Bretagne Sud, Inst Geoarchitecture, EA 2219, BP 573, F-56017 Vannes, France","Michelot, C (corresponding author), Univ La Rochelle, CNRS, UMR7372, CEBC, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France.",candice.michelot@gmail.com,"Barbraud, Christophe/A-5870-2012; Pinaud, David/B-6326-2008","Barbraud, Christophe/0000-0003-0146-212X; Pinaud, David/0000-0003-0815-9668",Agence des Aires Marines Protegees (AAMP),"We would like to thank all people who were involved in the field work, in the monitoring of the shag and in the pellet analysis.

By simultaneously (1) abrading the substrate (i.e. 'whiplash'), (2) altering local hydrodynamics and abiotic conditions and (3) influencing predator densities, marine algae can alter the recruitment and survival of the organisms with which they co-occur. I used predator exclusion cages and canopy manipulations in the barnacle-algae (Semibalanus balanoides-Ascophyllum nodosum) zone in Rhode Island (USA) intertidal habitats to demonstrate how to experimentally tease apart these types of multiple effects. In the absence of algal abrasion, barnacle recruitment was greater under the algal canopy than in cleared areas. This suggests that the canopy did not reduce the delivery of larvae but, rather, created a depositional environment where larvae accumulated. The overall effect of the canopy, however, was a reduction in recruitment compared to cleared areas because algal whiplash overwhelmed these positive, hydrodynamic effects. Predators had very Little effect on the recruitment of barnacles. In contrast to recruitment, I found that the canopy positively influenced the early post-recruitment survival of S, balanoides. The reduction in survival caused by predators was offset by an increase in survival caused by both the physical presence of the canopy (probably by reducing thermal stress) and its subsequent mechanical abrasion of the substrate (probably by reducing the accumulation of sediments). For both recruitment and survival, the effects of algal whiplash were twice as large as those of modifying the habitat or influencing predation intensity. In general, my findings illustrate how a series of a priori, statistical comparisons within a multi-factorial experiment can be used to separate and quantify these types of multiple effects in plant-animal interactions.","Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Leonard, GH (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA.",leonardg@leland.stanford.edu,,,,,,49,48,48,1,14,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

By biological remediation approach (addition of predators or competitors), it may alter the ecological relationships between the dominant algae and their associated populations in ecosystems. However, it cannot quantify the indirect effects of this approach and the long-term and system-level ecological consequences are hard to assess. Here we focus on the bloom areas of the Ulansuhai Lake in Inner Mongolia. Based on historic data, field monitoring and experimental data, we constructed a quantitative phosphorus cycle network model. Using Ecological Network Analysis (ENA), we evaluated how indirect flow influences dominant algal species and alters network control and utility relationships. Results indicate that: (1) Indirect flows have strong influence on the mutual and control relationships between blooming algae and its related functional groups in the Ulansuhai Lake; (2) Some opposite interspecific relationships between the blooming algae and other functional components have been found by ENA; (3) Key populations controlling the blooming algae are observed from the intuitive Zooplankton and Detritus to network-based Microorganisms, Zoobenthos, Zooplankton and Detritus(water). The research results indicate the importance of including indirect relationship into the control of lake algae bloom. The application of ENA was good at revealing indirect effects for ecological restoration of eutrophic lakes.","[Mao, Xufeng; Jin, Yanxiang; Ji, Xin] Qinghai Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Key Lab Phys Geog & Environm Proc, Xining 810000, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Wei, Xiaoyan] Beijing Univ Civil Engn & Architecture, Minist Educ, Beijing Climate Change Response Res & Educ Ctr, Key Lab Urban Stormwater Syst & Water Environm, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Donghai] Qinghai Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xining 810000, Qinghai, Peoples R China","Yuan, DH (corresponding author), Qinghai Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xining 810000, Qinghai, Peoples R China.",nanpishu1234@yeah.net,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51669028, 51409144]; State Key Research and Development Program [2016YFC0501906-01]; Natural Science Basic Research Project in Qinghai Province [2018-ZJ-712]",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51669028 & 51409144) and the State Key Research and Development Program (2016YFC0501906-01) and Natural Science Basic Research Project in Qinghai Province (2018-ZJ-712).

For both gecko species a positive correlation was demonstrated between prey density and the predation rate. Using Ae.aegypti males and unfed females as prey in a terrarium (0.054m(3)), consumption rates reached 76-108/day for G.dubia and 63-109/day for H.frenatus, with significantly more female mosquitoes than males being eaten in most experiments. Comparing dark with semi-illuminated conditions no consistent contrast of predation rate was demonstrated. Gehyra dubia predation rates on various Australian mosquito species were compared in an experimental room (32 m(3)) for 24h exposure with photoperiod L:D 12:12 h. Five photophilic species (Aedes vigilax, Anopheles annulipes, Coquillettidia xanthogaster, Culex annulirostris, Cx sitiens) suffered 78-100% predation, compared with only 33-53% predation of four non-photophilic species: Aedes aegypti, Ae. notoscriptus, Ae. vittiger and Cx quinquefasciatus. This demonstrates the potential benefit of domestication for geckoes that learn to hunt at light. When offered a mixture of unfed, freshly blood-fed and gravid females of Ae.aegypti in an illuminated terrarium, both gecko species consumed significantly more unfed than fed or gravid female mosquitoes, presumably because the latter rested wheras the former foraged more actively. H.frenatus consumed significantly more mosquitoes of all categories than did G.dubia per 24h: unfeds 5.1+/-0.1% v. 4.5+/-0.5%, blood-feds 4.5 +/- 0.3% v. 4.0 +/- 0.5% and gravids 4.8 +/- 0.4% v. 3.9 +/- 0.5%. Possible relevance of these results to competetive displacement of G.dubia by H.frenatus is discussed.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Dept Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Vector Res Lab, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Canyon, DV (corresponding author), James Cook Univ N Queensland, Dept Publ Hlth & Trop Med, Vector Res Lab, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",,,,,,,29,19,23,1,12,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-283X,,,MED VET ENTOMOL,Med.

This is usually interpreted as resource partitioning, potentially due to current or past competition, but other explanations have been proposed. Three closely related species of alcids breeding together in subarctic southwest Greenland differed in several aspects of their foraging ecology during chick rearing. Thick-billed Murres (Uria lomvia) and Common Murres (U. aalge) did not differ in their diving behavior but both species differed markedly with Razorbills (Alca torda). Thick-billed Murres foraged mainly close to the colony, whereas Common Murres and Razorbills also made foraging trips to the mainland coast. Common Murres made significantly more bouts (series of dives) per trip than Thick-billed Murres, but significantly fewer dives per bout than Razorbills. Median dive depth of Thick-billed and Common murres was twice that of Razorbills. Thick-billed Murres nested on open ledges and spent most of their non-foraging time on the ledge attending the chick. Common Murres and Razorbills nested under boulders and in crevices and often left their chicks alone (particularly at night) and rested on the water. One interpretation of this pattern is that the risk of predation from Glaucous Gulls (Larus hyperboreus) was much higher on open ledges, and that Thick-billed Murres therefore had to guard their chicks at all times.","[Linnebjerg, Jannie F.; Reuleaux, Anna; Frederiksen, Morten] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Mouritsen, Kim N.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Aquat Biol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Linnebjerg, JF (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",jannie.linnebjerg@gmail.dk,"Mouritsen, Kim N/K-6569-2013; Frederiksen, Morten/A-7542-2008; Linnebjerg, Jannie/AAI-4571-2020","Mouritsen, Kim N/0000-0003-3564-8328; Frederiksen, Morten/0000-0001-5550-0537; Linnebjerg, Jannie Fries/0000-0003-4043-0606","Greenland Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum, Nuuk","Permits to conduct fieldwork at Kitsissut Avalliit as well as handling, banding, deploying loggers and taking samples from the different species of birds were obtained from the Ministry of Fisheries, Hunting and Agriculture (APNN) in Greenland (Jr. Nr. 66.01.13 and Dok.

The aphid Uroleucon nigrotuberculatum Olive, which is specialised to the tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima L., in its native range, has become a dominant species on the introduced tall goldenrod in Japan. How this exotic aphid influenced arthropod communities on the introduced tall goldenrod in aphid-present (spring) and aphid-absent (autumn) seasons was examined, using an aphid removal experiment. 2. In spring, aphid presence increased ant abundance because aphid honeydew attracted foraging ant workers. A significant negative correlation was found between the numbers of ants and herbivorous insects other than aphids on the aphid-exposed plants, but no significant correlation was detected on the aphid-free plants. Thus, the aphid presence was likely to decrease the abundance of co-occurring herbivorous insects through removal behaviour of the aphid-tending ants. There were no significant differences in plant traits between the aphid-exposed and aphid-free plants. 3. In autumn, the numbers of lateral shoots and leaves, and the leaf nitrogen content were increased in response to the aphid infestation in spring. Because of the improvement of plant traits by aphid feeding, the abundance of leaf chewers increased on aphid-exposed plants. In contrast, the abundance of sap feeders decreased on the aphid-exposed plants. In particular, the dominant scale insect among sap feeders, Parasaissetia nigra Nietner, decreased, followed by a decrease in the abundance of ants attending P. nigra. Thus, aphid feeding may have attenuated the negative impacts of the tending ants on leaf chewers. 4. Aphid presence did not change herbivore species richness but changed the relative density of dominant herbivores, resulting in community-wide effects on co-occurring herbivores through ant-mediated indirect effects, and on temporally separated herbivores through plant-and ant-mediated indirect effects. The aphid also altered predator community composition by increasing and decreasing the relative abundance of aphid-tending ants in the spring and autumn, respectively.","[Ando, Yoshino; Ohgushi, Takayuki] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan; [Utsumi, Shunsuke] Univ Tokyo, Dept Gen Syst Studies, Meguro Ku, Tokyo, Japan","Ando, Y (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 509-3,2 Chome,Hiranocho, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",ando@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Frankel, Victor/F-7943-2011","Utsumi, Shunsuke/0000-0003-1558-8073","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [A-15207003, B-20370010];  [A14];  [A06]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [10J09260] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank T.

Although it is recognized that hunger plays an important role in determining the behaviour of terrestrial predatory groups, its specific effect on drilling gastropods is largely unexplored. Muricids have been shown to demonstrate change in prey preference and foraging behaviour when starved. Such behaviour is yet to be tested for naticid gastropods. In an experiment with live naticid gastropods, Natica tigrina and their bivalve prey Cardium sp., we evaluated the effect of hunger on the following aspects of predation: 1. Drilling frequency, 2. Size selectivity, and 3. Site selectivity. Comparing gastropods between satiated controlled group and starved experimental group we demonstrated a positive effect of hunger on drilling frequency. Using different stages of hunger, we found that hunger plays an important role in dictating prey size-selectivity. While hunger increases drilling frequency, it reduces the degree of prey size selectivity. Hunger is not found to initiate edge-drilling or incomplete drilling in N. tigrina. It has been postulated that prey selection by gastropods are correctly modelled by cost-benefit analysis; but the standard cost-benefit analysis does not account for hunger. However, our study demonstrates the relative importance of hunger in guiding drilling behaviour in naticids and hence it should be incorporated in future cost-benefit models. As hunger is often related to nutrient depleted conditions, these modifications in behaviour could be used to explain the spatial variation in drilling pattern by naticid gastropods.

For example, pond drying can lead to increased predation and competition as resources become limited and temperature and water quality undergo drastic fluctuations. Amphibians provide an excellent model for studying factors associated with survival in temporary habitats. Aquatic amphibians developing in ephemeral habitats must find food, avoid predators, and cope with potentially great fluctuations in abiotic parameters under increasingly harsh conditions. In Oregon (U.S.A.), larval long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) often inhabit temporary ponds that gradually dry during the summer. We have been studying several factors that may influence long-toed salamander behavior, growth, and survival in ephemeral montane ponds in the Cascade Range. These include biotic interactions focusing on cannibalism and predation, and abiotic factors, including ultraviolet (UV) radiation, an agent that can harm developing amphibians. Long-toed salamanders living in ephemeral ponds, like some other salamander species, exhibit trophic polymorphism, with some individuals having disproportionately broader and longer heads and enlarged vomerine teeth. The ingestion of different types of prey contributes to plasticity in head shape but other cues are essential to induce extreme trophic polymorphism. During periods of food limitation, individuals capable of using alternative food sources, including conspecifics, may experience a competitive advantage over their conspecifics. Morphological plasticity may therefore play an important role in resource partitioning and in alleviating intraspecific competition. The results of field experiments suggest that long-toed salamander embryos are highly susceptible to ambient levels of U-V-B radiation. UV radiation reduces hatching success and increases deformities. Laboratory tests suggest that larvae from populations from high elevations may be more resistant to U-V-B radiation than larvae from low-elevation populations. Like other amphibian species that may inhabit temporary ponds, tong-toed salamanders are potentially vulnerable to a wide array of pollutants, including those associated with nitrate and nitrite fertilizers. Synergistic interactions with a number of agents, including UV radiation and various toxic substances, may be especially harmful to long-toed salamanders.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Calif State Univ Hayward, Dept Biol Sci, Hayward, CA 94542 USA","Blaustein, AR (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, 3029 Cordley Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,"Belden, Lisa/0000-0002-3514-3920",,,,66,27,29,0,39,LASER PAGES PUBL LTD,JERUSALEM,"MERKAZ SAPIR 6/36, GIVAT SHAUL, PO BOX 35409, JERUSALEM 91352, ISRAEL",0021-2210,,,ISRAEL J ZOOL,Isr.

The Eastern Red-backed Salamander, Plethodon cinereus, is a polymorphic species that has served as a model organism in behavioral and ecological studies. Recent work suggests that the two most common color phenotypes (striped and unstriped) exhibit weak assortative mating and are diverging along a number of niche dimensions including temperature optima, diet, and response to predators. Males and females of P. cinereus are territorial and this behavior is thought to function in the context of prey and mate acquisition. Striped males have been shown to gain access to larger, and presumably more fecund, females. We posited that this pattern emerges through differential territorial behavior between the two phenotypes. We predicted that striped and unstriped salamanders would differ in their use of cover objects in the field, and in their aggressive responses to intruders in the laboratory. We examined salamander cover use and movement by placing artificial cover objects (ACOs) on the forest floor and monitoring them for 3.5 years. We compared residency time, number of recaptures, and number of ACOs occupied between the two phenotypes. The proportion of striped salamanders that were territorial residents was significantly greater than the proportion of unstriped salamanders that were territorial residents. Striped salamanders also exhibited significantly longer territorial residency, were recaptured more often, and were more often found under multiple, adjacent cover objects than unstriped salamanders. In the laboratory, we examined territorial behavior of the two morphs. As residents, striped salamanders were more aggressive and less submissive than were unstriped residents. When compared to intruders, resident salamanders of both morphs behaved more aggressively, but significant differences between resident and intruder behavior were only detected for the striped phenotype. These differences in aggression and cover object use may help to explain how striped males gain access to larger females and may be important in the interpretation of sympatric niche divergence and assortative mating by color in this species.","[Reiter, Marcie K.; Anthony, Carl D.; Hickerson, Cari-Ann M.] John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA","Anthony, CD (corresponding author), John Carroll Univ, Dept Biol, 1 John Carroll Blvd, Cleveland, OH 44118 USA.",mreiter11@jcu.edu; canthony@jcu.edu; chickerson@jcu.edu,,,JCU; George E.

We document that fire in combination with experimental exclusion of rodent consumers shifted a native desert shrubland to a low-diversity, invasive annual grassland dominated by Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass). In contrast, burned plots with rodents present suppressed invasion by cheatgrass and developed into a more diverse forb community. Rodents created strong biotic resistance to the establishment of aggressive plant invaders likely through seed and seedling predation, which had cascading effects on plant competition and plant community diversity. Fire mediated its positive effects on plant invaders through native plant removal and by decreasing the abundance and diversity of the rodent community. The experimental disruption of plant and consumer-mediated biotic resistance of plant invaders using fire and rodent exclusion treatments provides strong evidence that native plants and rodents are important regulators of plant invasion dynamics and plant biodiversity in our study system. While rodents conferred strong resistance to invasion in our study system, fluctuations in rodent populations due to disturbance and climatic events may provide windows of opportunity for exotic plant species to escape biotic resistance by rodent consumers and initiate invasions.","[St Clair, Samuel B.; McMillan, Brock] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Plant & Wildlife Sci, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [O'Connor, Rory; Gill, Richard] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Biol, Provo, UT 84602 USA","St Clair, SB (corresponding author), Brigham Young Univ, Dept Plant & Wildlife Sci, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",stclair@byu.edu,"Gill, Richard/AAC-8137-2021","Gill, Richard/0000-0001-8981-0621; O'Connor, Rory/0000-0002-6473-0032",USDA NIFAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2010-38415-21908],"We gratefully acknowledge the assistance of the Bureau of Land Management Salt Lake City Field Office for conducting NEPA clearance and carrying out the experimental burn treatments, especially Brad Jessop, Brook Chadwick and Rod Hardy.

Environmental factors like rnicroclimate, or the presence of competitors and predators often show seasonal or spatial variation, and behavioural plasticity that allows the caller to adjust to this variation may be adaptive. Prompted by the observation of across-season variation in elevated calling site use in our grey treefrog population, we formulated three hypotheses about their calling site choice and tested them using field observations and behavioural trials in the lab. We found that calling site selection is largely determined by local temperature regimes, and suggest that this temperature-based plasticity in calling site selection is adaptive because it allows males to increase their metabolic efficiency and mate attraction effectiveness. The mere presence of heterospecific competitors and predators did not affect calling site selection at the pond, but close proximity to a predator during behavioural trials did reduce calling activity.

Theoretical models predict that genetic or phenotypic variance within species can alter interspecific interactions, and experiments have shown that genotypic diversity in clonal species can impact a wide range of ecological processes. To extend these studies to quantitative trait variation within populations, we experimentally manipulated the variance in body size of threespine stickleback in enclosures in a natural lake environment. We found that body size of stickleback in the lake is correlated with prey size and (to a lesser extent) composition, and that stickleback can exert top-down control on their benthic prey in enclosures. However, a six-fold contrast in body size variance had no effect on the degree of diet variation among individuals, or on the abundance or composition of benthic or pelagic prey. Interestingly, post-hoc analyses revealed suggestive correlations between the degree of diet variation and the strength of top-down control by stickleback. Our negative results indicate that, unless the correlation between morphology and diet is very strong, ecological variation among individuals may be largely decoupled from morphological variance. Consequently we should be cautious in our interpretation both of theoretical models that assume perfect correlations between morphology and diet, and of empirical studies that use morphological variation as a proxy for resource use diversity.","[Ingram, Travis] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Ingram, Travis] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Bolnick, Daniel I.] Univ Texas Austin, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Ingram, T (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",ingram@zoology.ubc.ca,"Bolnick, Daniel I./G-4440-2015","Bolnick, Daniel I./0000-0003-3148-6296",David and Lucille Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1300426] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This research was supported by a David and Lucille Packard Foundation grant to DIB, and TI was funded by a National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) PGS-D3 award.

We also examined grazing effects on periphyton, the main food source for the tadpoles. Crayfish significantly reduced tadpole survival, particularly by feeding on Bufo. Rana benefited from reduced numbers of competitors, resulting from crayfish predation, by increased growth rate, whereas the growth rate of Bufo was unaffected by crayfish. The proportion of Rana in refuges (in relation to the number of survivors at the end of the experiment) was unaffected by crayfish, whereas proportionally more Bufo stayed in refuges in the presence of crayfish, relative to controls. Fish cues had no effect on tadpole survival of either species. During the entire larval period, Rana responded to fish cues by increasing the use of refuges relative to controls, whereas Bufo, did not show any significant behavioural response to fish cues. In accordance with these observations, the proportion of Rana in refuges at the end of the experiment was high in the presence of fish cues, whereas the use of refuges by Bufo was not affected by fish cues. Predatory crayfish and fish chemical cues had effects on tadpole survival, growth and refuge use. Tadpoles in all treatments reduced periphyton biomass. Both crayfish and fish cues had positive indirect effects on periphyton biomass. The positive indirect effect of fish cues on periphyton was likely an effect of reduced grazing from Rana. Thus lethal, as well as non-lethal, predator effects on prey populations can influence lower trophic levels.","Univ Lund, Dept Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Nystrom, P (corresponding author), Univ Lund, Dept Ecol, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",,"Langerhans, R.

This biocontrol agent, originating from the Eastern Mediterranean region, has been mass-reared for commercial use since 2005 and is widely used in augmentative biocontrol programs. As a polyphagous predator, it has to cope with different biotic and abiotic factors. However, possible adaptation to mass rearing for production might be hindering its resilience and capacity for optimum performance in the field. In this study, we investigated the effect of long-term mass rearing on the genetic diversity of A. swirskii. We identified six microsatellite loci from whole-genome nanopore sequencing of A. swirskii and used these in a comparative analysis of the genetic diversity and differentiation in eight wild populations collected from Israel in 2017 and a commercially available population. Our results indicate that the commercial population is 2.5x less heterozygous than the wild A. swirskii. Furthermore, the commercial population has the highest genetic differentiation from all the natural populations, as indicated by higher pairwise F-st values. Overall, we show that commercially reared A. swirskii have reduced genetic variation compared to their wild counterparts, which may reduce their performance when released to control pests in an integrated pest management (IPM) context.","[Paspati, Angeliki; Urbaneja, Alberto] IVIA, Unidad Mixta Gest Biotecnol Plagas UV IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Carretera Moncada Naquera Km 4,5, Valencia 46113, Spain; [Ferguson, Kim B.; Pannebakker, Bart A.] Wageningen Univ, Lab Genet, POB 16, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Verhulst, Eveline C.] Wageningen Univ, Lab Entomol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Gonzalez-Cabrera, Joel] Univ Valencia, Unidad Mixta Gest Biotecnol Plagas UV IVIA, Dept Genet, Estruct Recerca Interdisciplinar Biotecnol & Biom, Dr Moliner 50, E-46100 Burjassot, Spain","Pannebakker, BA (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Lab Genet, POB 16, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",bart.pannebakker@wur.nl,"Urbaneja, Alberto/C-9071-2011; Ferguson, Kim/AAM-4275-2020; Gonzalez-Cabrera, Joel/B-2279-2013; Verhulst, Eveline/J-2641-2013; URBANEJA, ALBERTO/AAW-6198-2020; Pannebakker, Bart/D-3823-2012","Urbaneja, Alberto/0000-0001-5986-3685; Ferguson, Kim/0000-0001-6483-1936; Gonzalez-Cabrera, Joel/0000-0002-8338-370X; Verhulst, Eveline/0000-0002-4781-535X; URBANEJA, ALBERTO/0000-0001-5986-3685; Pannebakker, Bart/0000-0001-8503-3896; Paspati, Angeliki/0000-0002-7110-8970","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [641456]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Ramon y Cajal Program [RYC-2013-13834]","We thank Arnon Tabic from Biobee Israel for his help in collecting the field samples, Eric Palevsky from the ARO-Newe-Ya'ar Research Center (Volcani Center, Israel) for providing valuable information and material, and Kirsten Oude Lenferink from Koppert Biological Systems for her technical assistance with the inbred lines.

Associational effects (AE) can transpire through changes in herbivore or plant traits that affect herbivore movement, densities, and feeding behaviors to ultimately affect plant damage. While much work has focused on understanding the mechanisms that underlie associational effects, we know little about how these mechanisms are influenced by neighborhood composition, i.e., plant density or relative frequency which is necessary to make predictions about when AE should occur in nature. Using a series of field and greenhouse experiments, I examined how plant density and relative frequency affected plant damage to Solanum carolinense and four mechanisms that underlie AE; (i) accumulation of insect herbivores and arthropod predators, (ii) microclimate conditions, (iii) plant resistance, and (iv) specialist herbivore preference. I found a positive relationship between S. carolinense damage and the relative frequency of a non-focal neighbor (Solidago altissima) and all four AE mechanisms were influenced by one or multiple neighborhood components. Frequency-dependence in S. carolinense damage is most likely due to greater generalist herbivore load on S. carolinense (through spillover from S. altissima) with microclimate variables, herbivore preference, predation pressures, and plant resistance having relatively weaker effects. Associational effects may have long-term consequences for these two plant species during plant succession and understanding context-dependent herbivory has insect pest management implication for other plant species in agriculture and forestry.","[Kim, Tania N.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Kim, Tania N.] Univ Wisconsin, Great Lakes Bioenergy Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Kim, TN (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; Kim, TN (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Great Lakes Bioenergy Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",tania.kim@wisc.edu,,,National Science Foundation Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1110460],"This research was supported by the National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology #1110460.

Hispid hare distribution includes the tropical grassland ecosystem in Nepal. Grassland fire is one of the management regimes used in this region and its impact on biodiversity is controversial. We investigated the diet and habitat use of hispid hare before and after a grassland fire at Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve (SWR) in Nepal. Fecal pellets were used for micro-histological analysis to understand hispid hare diet. We laid out sampling plots in areas where we encountered hispid hare sign and recorded habitat and vegetation information. We also looked for signs of hare presence along systematically positioned transect lines and used these data to assess the population status of hispid hare. Population density of hispid hare was 5.76 individuals/km(2) and we estimated a population size of 219 +/- 40 hispid hare within the 41 km(2) grasslands of SWR. Hispid hare primarily used tall grassland habitat. Nineteen plant species were identified in hispid hare pellets with Saccharum spontaneum and Imperata cylindrica having the highest frequency of occurrence. There were no significant differences in the distribution of plant species in the pellets before and after the fire; however a significantly higher diversity of plants were recorded in hispid hare diet after the fire. We recommend a change to the timing of grass burning to either before or after the hispid hare breeding season to reduce the direct (burning, destruction of nests) and indirect (increased risk of predation) negative effects of such grassland management on hare populations. Population management strategies and a field based conservation captive breeding program should be implemented immediately to maintain a viable population of hispid hare in SWR.","[Aryal, Achyut; Brunton, Dianne] Massey Univ, Inst Nat Sci, Ecol & Conservat Grp, N Shore Mail Ctr, Auckland, New Zealand; [Ji, Weihong] Massey Univ, Inst Nat Sci, Human Wildlife Interact Res Grp, N Shore Mail Ctr, Auckland, New Zealand; [Adhikari, Bikash] Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Forestry, Pokhara, Nepal; [Raubenheimer, David] Massey Univ, Inst Nat Sci, Nutr Ecol Res Grp, N Shore Mail Ctr, Auckland, New Zealand","Aryal, A (corresponding author), Massey Univ, Inst Nat Sci, Ecol & Conservat Grp, N Shore Mail Ctr, Private Bag 102 904, Auckland, New Zealand.",savefauna@gmail.com,"Aryal, Achyut/A-8330-2013","Aryal, Achyut/0000-0001-6658-8714; Raubenheimer, David/0000-0001-9050-1447; Aryal, Achyut/0000-0002-2695-9901","Zoologische Gesellschaft fur Arten- und Populationsschutz e.

All 1985 specimens collected were in the juvenile stage, with a mean standard length (SL) of 29.9 mm. They occurred on the onshore side of the Kuroshio axis along the slope region off Japan, showing a typical pseudoceanic distribution. Juveniles <35 mm SL depended heavily on appendicularians, while juveniles >= 35 mm SL preyed on various species of copepods (predominantly Candacia bipinnata) and euphausiid calyptopis and furcilia stages. Based on estimated biomass (2.85 mg m(-3)) and nighttime ration (10.5-13.8% of body weight d(-1)), the predatory impacts of M. orientate on the biomass and production rate of the mesozooplankton were calculated to be 0.3-0.8% and 6.0-15.5%, respectively, in the surface layer. In the study area, M. orientale co-occurs with larvae and juveniles of Japanese sardine and mackerels, both of which also prey on appendicularians. Predatory impacts of M. orientale <35 mm SL on the biomass and production rate of appendicularians were estimated to be 2.5-7.4% and 4.7-14.1%, respectively. This suggests that M. orientate is a competitor for prey with the small pelagic fish on the onshore side of the Kuroshio axis during late winter.","[Sassa, Chiyuki] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Seikai Natl Fisheries Res Inst, 1551-8 Taira Machi, Nagasaki 8512213, Japan; [Takasuka, Akinori] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Kanazawa Ku, 2-12-4 Fukuura, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2368648, Japan; [Takasuka, Akinori] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Aquat Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Sassa, C (corresponding author), Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Seikai Natl Fisheries Res Inst, 1551-8 Taira Machi, Nagasaki 8512213, Japan.",csassa@fra.affrc.go.jp,,,"Study of Kuroshio Ecosystem Dynamics for Sustainable Fisheries (SKED) programme of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [JPMXD0511102330]","We are grateful to the officers and crew of the research/training vessel `Wakatake-Maru' (Hokkaido Prefectural Government) for their assistance in the field sampling.

Further, the complexity of these trophic relationships exacerbates our inability to predict climate change effects on invaded ecosystems. We explore the hypothesis that interactions between two global change drivers, invasive vertebrates and climate change, will potentially make matters worse for native biodiversity. In New Zealand beech (Nothofagus spp.) forests, a highly irruptive invasive mammal community is driven by multi-annual resource pulses of beech seed (masting). Because mast frequency is predicted to increase with climate change, we use this as a model system to explore the extent to which such effects may influence invasive vertebrate communities, and the implications of such interactions for native biodiversity and its management. We build on an established model of trophic interactions in the system, combining it with a logistic probability mast function, the parameters of which were altered to simulate either contemporary conditions or conditions of more or less frequent masting. The model predicts that increased mast frequency will lead to populations of a top predator (the stoat) and a mesopredator (the ship rat) becoming less irruptive and being maintained at appreciably higher average abundances in this forest type. In addition, the ability of both current and in-development management approaches to suppress invasive mammals is predicted to be compromised. Because invasive mammals are key drivers of native fauna extinction in New Zealand, with the additional loss of associated functions such as pollination and seed dispersal, these predictions imply potentially serious adverse impacts of climate change for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function. Our study also highlights the importance of long-term monitoring data for assessing and managing future impacts of global change drivers.","[Tompkins, Daniel M.] Landcare Res, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Byrom, Andrea E.; Pech, Roger P.] Landcare Res, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Pech, Roger P.] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Joint Grad Sch Biodivers & Biosecur, Auckland 1, New Zealand","Tompkins, DM (corresponding author), Landcare Res, Private Bag 1930, Dunedin, New Zealand.",tompkinsd@landcareresearch.co.nz,,"Tompkins, Daniel/0000-0003-3209-8084","Science and Innovation Group of the New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and EmploymentNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) [C09X0505, C09X0909]","This research was funded by the Science and Innovation Group of the New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (contract numbers C09X0505 and C09X0909 and core funding to Crown Research Institutes).

We used several flow regime attributes and fish sampling data obtained from the San Juan River, New Mexico and Utah, during 1993-2010 to evaluate the potential use of flow manipulations to increase recruitment of native fishes that must cope with nonnative species. During this period, discharge in the river was partially manipulated by reservoir releases that augmented naturally high spring flows in this snowmelt-driven system. An information theoretic approach was used to rank candidate models that predicted species densities based upon selected combinations of flow attributes and abundances of nonnative species. Autumn density of age-0 fishes in secondary channels was the main response variable. The main predictor variables included flow attributes associated with interannual variation in daily discharge and water temperature; densities of nonnative competitors; and catch rates of a numerically dominant nonnative predator (the channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus). Top-ranked models for native species included positive associations with small-bodied nonnative fishes and negative associations with the abundance of channel catfish adults. Densities of native speckled dace Rhinichthys osculus and flannelmouth suckers Catostomus latipinnis increased with mean spring discharge, but the density of native bluehead suckers C. discobolus did not. With the exception of juvenile channel catfish, the top candidate models predicting densities of nonnative fishes all included the duration of low summer flows. These results confirmed findings from a previous study that demonstrated different responses of native and nonnative fishes to seasonal flows; the present study also revealed that densities of all fishes were generally lower in years with greater abundance of adult channel catfish. Regression analysis indicated that seasonal flow manipulations and suppression of nonnative predator populations could be effective management tools to restore and maintain the native fish community.","[Gido, Keith B.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Propst, David L.] Univ New Mexico, Museum SW Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Gido, KB (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",kgido@ksu.edu,"Propst, D./S-6441-2019; Gido, Keith/B-5151-2013",,U.S. Bureau of Reclamation; New Mexico Department of Game and Fish (State Wildlife Grants); U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service; San Juan River Basin Recovery Implementation Program,"Field work was accomplished with the assistance of numerous colleagues, most notably L.

During this study in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa, a spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta Erxleben, 1777 (Hyaenidae) population was surveyed by attracting individuals with pre-recorded sounds. The hyaena population (excluding cubs) is substantially larger (321 individuals) than the previous estimate of 200 and this population is the second largest protected population 2 in South Africa. Average hyaena density, at 0.357 individuals/km(2), was relatively high compared to other southern African conservation areas, and range from 0 to 1.25 individuals/km(2) across sampling stations. For short periods, spatial heterogeneity in density was marked at small and large spatial scales, but decreased when averaged over a longer period. This heterogeneity may be important in promoting the coexistence of other large and mobile carnivores in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park by creating potential dynamic competition refugia in space and time. Furthermore, heterogeneity of hyaena density at smaller scales should influence studies investigating the avoidance of hyaenas by competitively inferior carnivores.","[Graf, Jan A.; Slotow, Rob] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa; [Somers, Michael J.] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Wildlife Management, Ctr Invas Biol, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Gunther, Micaela Szykman] Smithsonian Inst, Ctr Species Survival, Conservat & Res Ctr, Natl Zool Pk, Front Royal, VA 22630 USA; [Gunther, Micaela Szykman] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Wildlife, Arcata, CA 95521 USA","Graf, JA (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa.",janandreasgraf@yahoo.com,"Slotow, Rob/AAM-9053-2020; /A-1523-2008","Szykman Gunther, Micaela/0000-0002-7822-8094; Slotow, Rob/0000-0001-9469-1508; /0000-0002-5836-8823",Green Trust (WWF-SA); Wildlands Conservation Trust; Endangered Wildlife Trust; National Research Foundation; Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Institution; Sichel Family Endowment; National ZooSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute; University of KwaZulu-Natal,"We thank The Green Trust (WWF-SA), The Wildlands Conservation Trust, The Endangered Wildlife Trust, National Research Foundation, Smithsonian Institution, Sichel Family Endowment, Friends of the National Zoo, and the University of KwaZulu-Natal for funding.

We here investigated in a game ranch in Zimbabwe density-dependent responses of body condition and recruitment in an impala (Aepyceros melampus (Lichtenstein, 1812)) population that underwent an experimental drastic reduction of density within 2 years under similar rainfall and predation pressure. Body condition of all sex and age classes was lower during the high-density year than during the low-density year, suggesting increased competition for restricted resources at high density. In addition, we observed a significant increase in population recruitment (from 0.47 to 0.80 juveniles/female) as population density declined. Our study provides a rare example of a direct density-dependent response of body condition at the individual level in a tropical ungulate species, and indicates that food resource variation controls population dynamics of impala under constant and moderate predation pressure: as is commonly reported in temperate populations of large herbivores.","[Gaillard, J. -M.] Univ Lyon 1, Ctr Natl Res Sci, UMR 5558, Lab Biometr & Biol Evolut, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Gaidet, N.] CIRAD, UPR 22, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France","Gaidet, N (corresponding author), CIRAD, UPR 22, TA 30-E,Campus Int Baillarguet, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",nicolas.gaidet@cirad.fr,"Gaidet, Niccolas/H-8122-2013",,,,,69,16,16,1,18,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Here, we expand this framework by demonstrating that mutualism can fundamentally alter community and food web structure. In large, replicated field plots, we manipulated the mutualism between a dominant plant (Lolium arundinaceum) and symbiotic fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum). The presence of the mutualism reduced arthropod abundance up to 70%, reduced arthropod diversity nearly 20%, shifted arthropod species composition relative to endophyte-free plots and suppressed the biomass and richness of other plant species in the community. Herbivorous arthropods were more strongly affected than carnivores, and for both herbivores and carnivores, effects of the mutualism appeared to propagate indirectly via organisms occurring more basally in the food web. The influence of the mutualism was as great or greater than previously documented effects of competition and predation on arthropod communities. Our work demonstrates that a keystone mutualism can significantly reduce arthropod biodiversity at a broad community scale.","[Rudgers, Jennifer A.] Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Rudgers, Jennifer A.; Clay, Keith] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Rudgers, JA (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",jrudgers@rice.edu,"Clay, Keith/C-8730-2012","Rudgers, Jennifer/0000-0001-7094-4857",,,,80,81,84,2,82,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Avoidance was measured using the frequency of captures in traps containing grasshopper mouse odors compared with that in traps containing odors of an innocuous rodent (Reithrodontomys megalotis) and in clean traps. We predicted that deer mice would be most deterred by odors in areas where grasshopper mice were common, and during winter, when alternative prey for grasshopper mice are less abundant. We also expected reproductive females to show greater avoidance because of the vulnerability of litters in burrows. Surprisingly, deer mice showed no evidence of avoidance in any experiments. These results are consistent with trapping records from capture-recapture studies on our site. We assert that the presence of grasshopper mice may affect the surface activity of deer mice, but that deer mice apparently do not use olfactory cues to avoid grasshopper mice. Taken with other studies noting the lack of avoidance of predator odors by deer mice and similar species, our results suggest that the response of rodents to predator odors is more variable than was previously appreciated.",,"Stapp, P (corresponding author), COLORADO STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,FT COLLINS,CO 80523, USA.",,,,,,,48,3,3,0,2,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0008-4301,,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

We compared annual censuses of orb-spider populations on 24 islands with diurnal lizards present, and on 20 islands with diurnal lizards absent, to rainfall over a 10-year period. A strong positive correlation (Pearson r=0.877) was found between mean spider density on nolizard islands and the number of days of rain that occurred 2 months prior to spider censuses; correlation coefficients declined with longer and shorter time periods prior to censuses. Correlation coefficients between mean spider density on lizard islands and rainfall showed a similar pattern but were generally lower than those for no-lizard islands. The strength of the impact of lizards on spiders, measured as the ratio of mean spider density on no-lizard islands to mean spider density on lizard islands, varied considerably and was positively correlated with rainfall; the correlation was highest with number of rain days 6 months prior to spider censuses (r-=0.741). Repeated-measures analysis of variance on the time series of spider densities showed that the lizard factor (present versus absent) varied significantly among years. Split-plot ANOVA with rainfall as a covariate indicated that spider density and the impact of lizards on spider density were both significantly correlated with rainfall. We discuss several hypotheses on the causal mechanisms that integrate abiotic and biotic factors.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS, CTR POPULAT BIOL, DIV BIOL SCI, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA","SPILLER, DA (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS, EVOLUT & ECOL SECT, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA.",,,,,,,39,28,33,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1995,103,2,,,,,133,139,,10.1007/BF00329072,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RN783,WOS:A1995RN78300001,28306765,,,,2021-09-27,

Spatially constrained grazing by herbivores, particularly parrotfishes, may foster coral recruitment by creating a spatially continuous refuge of bare substrate for settlement and survival. However, frequent bouts of concentrated feeding potentially remove newly settled corals. Understanding the frequency and intensity of parrotfish foraging behavior at appropriate scales (months and meters) is essential for connecting herbivory with benthic processes. We documented the foraging behavior of a large, mobile coral reef herbivore (the steephead parrotfish Chlorurus microrhinos) on Palmyra Atoll using various techniques (observational follows, fish surveys, and bite scar tracking) across 2 habitat states (one dominated by algal turfs, one dominated by live coral and crustose coralline algae) that are representative of reefs throughout the Central Pacific. Large differences in the abundance of a preferred resource were associated with major differences in feeding behavior. Where resources were abundant and regrew quickly, foraging areas were small and spatially focused, resulting in dense patches of bite scars (> 100 bites m(-2)). Feeding behavior also showed a temporal periodicity, with individuals defending and regrazing the same area after regrowth occurred. In areas where resources were less abundant and recovered more slowly, parrotfish movements and foraging areas were significantly larger and bites were distributed sparsely across food patches. The large variability we observed within a single atoll suggests that characterizing species-specific foraging patterns from small-scale studies may not be appropriate.","[Carlson, P.

Synthetic attractants mainly bark beetle pheromones and host monoterpenes attached to traps are typically used to monitor beetle populations within its range. Despite well-established differences in beetle host selection behavior between endemic and outbreak population densities, the influence of population density on the response of mountain pine beetle to the synthetic attractants is poorly understood. Over three years, we tested the effects of different release rates of female mountain pine beetle aggregation pheromone (trans-verbenol) and two host monoterpenes (terpinolene and mycrene) and local beetle population density on trap catches of mountain pine beetle. We estimated local mountain pine beetle population densities using the number of dead trees observed in the previous year's aerial detection survey. During the first three weeks of the flight period, the lures with low release rates of all components captured more mountain pine beetle with increasing beetle population density and the lures with a high release rate of trans-verbenol plus a low release rate of host monoterpenes were preferred by beetles in low population density sites. We also found a temporal shift in attraction patterns. As the flight period progressed, the preference for low trans-verbenol release rate lures was less pronounced at high mountain pine beetle densities. No sex-specific responses of mountain pine beetles, along with number of competitor and predatory beetles of mountain pine beetle, were found for a particular attractant. These results provide evidence that mountain pine beetle has a density dependent response to attractants and can assess available semiochemicals cues to ensure successful host colonization depending on their density and the flight period. Overall, this study can improve the efficacy of current semiochemical-based monitoring tools, which are essential to implementing informed mitigation strategies for mountain pine beetle especially while they are in a sub-outbreak stage in the expanded distribution.","[Klutsch, Jennifer G.; Classens, Gail; Erbilgin, Nadir] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Classens, Gail; Cahill, James F., Jr.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Whitehouse, Caroline] Alberta Agr & Forestry, Forest Hlth & Adapt Sect, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Klutsch, JG (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",klutsch@ualberta.ca,,,fRI Research; Alberta Agriculture and Forestry; Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment; Forestry Branch of Sustainable Development in Manitoba; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry,"Funding was provided by fRI Research (https://friresearch.ca/), Alberta Agriculture and Forestry, Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment, The Forestry Branch of Sustainable Development in Manitoba, and Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.

Stressors such as overfishing and nutrient pollution may reduce resilience of coral reefs by increasing coral-algal competition and reducing coral recruitment, growth and survivorship. Such effects may themselves develop via several mechanisms, including disruption of coral microbiomes. Here we report the results of a 3-year field experiment simulating overfishing and nutrient pollution. These stressors increase turf and macroalgal cover, destabilizing microbiomes, elevating putative pathogen loads, increasing disease more than twofold and increasing mortality up to eightfold. Above-average temperatures exacerbate these effects, further disrupting microbiomes of unhealthy corals and concentrating 80% of mortality in the warmest seasons. Surprisingly, nutrients also increase bacterial opportunism and mortality in corals bitten by parrotfish, turning normal trophic interactions deadly for corals. Thus, overfishing and nutrient pollution impact reefs down to microbial scales, killing corals by sensitizing them to predation, above-average temperatures and bacterial opportunism.","[Zaneveld, Jesse R.; McMinds, Ryan; Payet, Jerome P.; Welsh, Rory; Correa, Adrienne M.

In shallow coastal dynamic ecosystems mussels can be cultivated directly on the seabed, however this method has a low return as mussels exposed to natural environments risk dislodgment, high predation rates, sedimentation and competition. The formation of spatial patterns in natural mussel beds, that result in 'organized patchiness', is thought to be an adaptive mechanism to reduce population losses. The driver and effects of this patterning need to be disentangled at multiple spatial scales in which patterns are observed. With a field experiment we aimed to understand how small-scale density (actual cover) and patterning (perimeter: area ratio of clumps and number of mussel layers) can be altered by manipulating large scale density (re-laying biomass), that farmers could control during seeding activity. Within this study we considered the interplay between environmental conditions (manipulating flow rate with the use of large mesh cages) and density for pattern development and persistence, and the repercussions of this on mussel productivity (growth and condition). We further investigated local scale processes, such as the role of within-clump biological activity (biodeposition), that may be a predictor for the larger scale observations of losses and persistence relative to density. We found that manipulating density by controlling seeding biomass from boats is not an accurate predictor of actual seabed density and resulting patterning. The growth and condition of the mussels was only influenced by local scale effects, resulting in high 'within clumps' variation. Aiming for an intermediate density to avoid both excessive fragmentation and excessive layering may be viewed as an optimal strategy to maximise returns, but we encourage the incorporation of the hierarchy of multiple scales of density in future studies of patterning that will allow the inclusion of these effects in a model of growth and productivity.","[Bertolini, C.; ter Veld, J.

We examined the importance of empty Chthamalus spp. tests as a habitat for the intertidal common periwinkle Melaraphe neritoides on Portuguese rocky shores. The role played by the space between neighbouring barnacles as a habitat for other species has been largely studied with regard to how an ecosystem functions, whereas the equivalent role of empty barnacle tests remains largely unknown. The small periwinkle is one of the most abundant snails in European rocky shores and is an important prey for key mobile predators. Biological facilitation is common in the rocky intertidal zone, where biological structures often potentiate the abundance of other species. The role played by barnacles as biological facilitators through habitat provision is not fully understood. In this study, the abundance and morphometric features of empty barnacle tests and their occupants were examined across shore levels and shores with differing exposures, as these are important gradients explaining barnacle distribution. The availability of empty barnacle tests was also experimentally manipulated to examine the percentage, time and length of occupation. Empty barnacles were more abundant on the midshore of sheltered shores and barnacle tests were wider on the upper shore but taller on the midshore. The minimum barnacle test occupation rate by the periwinkle was 70%. Barnacle shell height was an important factor determining snail occupation, where taller barnacles harboured significantly more, but not necessarily larger, snails. Snails outside the barnacle tests were significantly larger than those found within, suggesting that this crustacean group has an increased importance as a habitat for juvenile snails, thus potentially influencing the population dynamics of M.neritoides. We found that occupation of experimentally created empty barnacles was extremely high (70%) on the day after, and remained at 100% after 3months of monitoring. Our study is the first of its kind to focus on the features of barnacle tests that snails occupy and their occupying snail traits. According to our results, it is clear that barnacles have an important role in providing additional habitat for young gastropods. The small periwinkle is an important grazer and prey for intertidal and subtidal foraging predators; hence, the potential refuge role of barnacle tests for juvenile M.neritoides may be important in the dynamics of intertidal communities.","[Silva, Ana C.

The direct effects of non-predator organisms on the midge larvae are due to physical disturbance that destroys their tubes. This may result in vulnerability of midge larvae to predators in the wild.

Chew cards are increasingly used for mammalian pest monitoring. They are effective for measuring the relative abundance of rats (Rattusspp.), but their effectiveness for measuring hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) relative abundance has not been tested. Camera traps are also increasingly used as a monitoring tool, but there has been little calibration with other methods. We investigated whether chew card indices and camera indices for hedgehogs and rats gave consistent monitoring results. We also explored the relationship between the relative abundance of rats and hedgehogs using these indices. Hedgehog and rat chew card indices both showed a positive relationship with the respective camera indices for each taxon. However, cameras had fewer detections than chew cards when relative abundance was low (particularly for rats). Interference by rats did not appear to affect detection of hedgehogs with chew cards. Although not a strongly supported result in our study, the relationship between rat and hedgehog relative abundances requires further study and is a reminder that single-species pest control may not produce desired biodiversity outcomes.","[Nottingham, Catherine M.; Stanley, Margaret C.] Univ Auckland, Ctr Biodivers & Biosecur, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Glen, Alistair S.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Auckland, New Zealand","Nottingham, CM (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Ctr Biodivers & Biosecur, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand.",cnot147@aucklanduni.ac.nz,,,Centre for Biodiversity Biosecurity; University of Auckland,"Our thanks to Alice Baranyovits, Ohara McLennan, Isobel King and Melissa Kirk who helped with field work.

The more abundant are supposed to be involved in crop pest regulation. However, the lack of knowledge about ecological interactions between ants and their habitat, including other ant species of the community, leaded to contradictory views on their efficiency as potential biological control agents. In the present study, we studied the impact of shade trees on the occurrence and spatial distribution of the most abundant ants of cocoa agroforestry systems of Southern Cameroon. We characterized shade of four traditional cocoa farms and described distribution patterns of numerically dominant ants through spatial analysis. Our results showed that the populations of the most abundant arboreal species, in our study Oecophylla longinoda, Tetramorium aculeatum, Crematogaster spp., Camponotus spp. were generally aggregated in plantations. However, the distribution structure of ant populations was variable between samples, suggesting that the normal development of ant colonies may interfere with ecological constraints like interspecific competition and abiotic factors. Distribution mapping as well as statistical analysis showed that highest densities of O. longinoda were sheltered by cocoa trees in the sunniest areas of plots. On the other hand, Crematogaster species were usually strongly aggregated in the most shaded areas. Mechanisms involved in ant/shade relationships were discussed and we suggested that a good management of shade may take into account ant communities, which could play a significant role in conservation biological control against cocoa pests.","[Tadu, Zephirin; Djieto-Lordon, Champlain; Yede; Youbi, Edith Messop; Alene, Chantal Desiree] Univ Yaounde I, Zool Lab, Fac Sci, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Fomena, Abraham] Univ Yaounde I, Lab Parasitol & Ecol, Fac Sci, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Babin, Regis] CIRAD, UPR Bioagresseurs Analyse & Maitrise Risque, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Babin, Regis] ICIPE, Plant Hlth Div, Coffee Pest Project, Nairobi 00100, Kenya","Babin, R (corresponding author), CIRAD, UPR Bioagresseurs Analyse & Maitrise Risque, F-34398 Montpellier, France.",regis.babin@cirad.fr,"Babin, Regis/N-3682-2019; Babin, Regis/D-5322-2014","Babin, Regis/0000-0002-3753-1193",French Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the REPARAC project,"We thank farmers of Bokito, Obala and Ngomedzap for allowing us to carry out the present study in their cocoa farms.

This study presents the diet of Diapterus rhombeus, Eucinostomus argenteus, E. gula (Gerreidae) and Bairdiella ronchus (Sciaenidae), the most commonly observed type of fish in the experimental catches performed in 2002 in this lagoon. Various fishing methods were used for sampling: fixed or active nets and anaesthetic rotenone, during daytime (February 2002) and night-time (April 2002). Four hundred and three specimens were collected: 77 D. rhombeus, 59 E. argenteus, 192 E. gula and 75 B. ronchus. Total length L-t, fork length L-f, standard length L-s and body mass M-b were used to calculate both the total length-fork length relationship (L-t = aL(f) + b) and the body mass-total length relationship (Mb = aLt(b)), where 3.03 <= b <= 3.33. The various prey contained in the stomach of the three gerreid species and one sciaenid were determined and counted, and the following food indices were calculated by assignment of points to each item to show their relative importance: occurrence frequency, numerical and biomass percentages. The number of points assigned to each item is related to its digestibility and size. For fish caught at night, the filling a degree was evaluated, per 25% classes, to point out the diet peak of D. rhombeus and B. ronchus. For each species, the diet versus size study revealed a progressive diet change. First, the trophic spectrum in the gerreids tends to increase with fish size (from four to generally eight items, but sometimes up to thirteen or fifteen items according to the species). The same behaviour is observed for the sciaenids (from three to fifteen items). Then, for the largest specimens, the trophic spectrum tends to decrease. The mouth size seems to control the qualitative food choice. In the case of small gerreids, when the total length Lt is inferior to 10 cm, copepods, the smallest preys observed, are the most consumed, but their preponderance decreases with the predator size. For the largest individuals, either amphipods with D. rhombeus or polychaetes with E. argenteus and at a lesser extent with E. gula are dominant in the diet. Bivalves, gasteropods, ostracods, isopods, foraminifera, various crustacean and small fish make up the gerreid trophic spectrum. Nematods, also present, have not been identified as preys or parasites. In the case of the sciaenid, four items prevail successively with growth: copepods, mysids, amphipods and fish. Also, B. ronchus feeds on cumacea. isopods and polychaetes. The small number of gerreids captured at night, compared to daytime, and the low degree of stomach filling show that gerreids are mainly diurnal. The food peak of B. ronchus, according to the literature, occurs at dawn. However, in our study, a B. ronchus has never been caught during day-time and its stomach filling-up degree showed a peak between 2 and 3 a.m. The difference in the rhythm of activity is related to the species predation modes. since observations show that gerreids hunt at sight (surely more effective in the day), whereas sciaenid rather use their sense of touch that is perhaps a more competitive tactic at night. For all species studied, the diet variations could be explained by a change of the ecological niche followed by a diet choice in favour of the most profitable preys. A different nychtemeral rhythm between the two families is pointed out. This opposition leads to a resource share and/or depends upon a ifferent anti predation strategy.","[Bouchereau, Jean-Luc; Chantrel, Josselin] Univ Antilles Guyane, Dept Biol, CNRS, MNHN,IRD,UPMC,UMR 7138, Campus Fouillole,BP 592, F-97159 Pointe A Pitre, Guadeloupe, France","Bouchereau, JL (corresponding author), Univ Antilles Guyane, Dept Biol, CNRS, MNHN,IRD,UPMC,UMR 7138, Campus Fouillole,BP 592, F-97159 Pointe A Pitre, Guadeloupe, France.",jean-luc.bouchereau@univ-ag.fr,,,,,,36,6,6,0,1,SOC FRANCAISE D ICHTYOLOGIE,PARIS,"MUSEUM NATL D HISTOIRE NATURELLE, 43 RUE CUVIER, 75231 PARIS, FRANCE",0399-0974,,,CYBIUM,Cybium,SEP 30,2009,33,3,,,,,179,191,,,,,13,Zoology,Zoology,530NI,WOS:000272599200002,,,,,2021-09-27,

In this study, we examine an obligate pollination/seed predation mutualism between moths and yuccas and the balance of direct and indirect effects of ants, aphids, and cheater moths on this mutualism. Cheater moths (Tegeticula corruptrix) do not pollinate yuccas but oviposit into developing fruit, where their larvae Consume Yucca seeds. The overall effect of ants and aphids on yuccas was positive. Ants and aphids had no negative impact on the number of fruit retained per plant, and they had a positive effect on the average number of viable seeds per fruit. Yuccas with high ant and aphid densities had a 60% increase in viable, uneaten seeds. This increase ill seed production was largely due to the negative interactions between ants and T. corruptrix. The reduction of cheater ovipositions saved yuccas almost 46 seeds per fruit, plus all additional 26 seeds from the reduction of cheater larvae. Aphids also had all additional indirect benefit, because ants were less likely to damage Yucca fruit when aphids were present. This study shows that strong positive interactions, such as the aphid/ant mutualism on yuccas, call also generate strong indirect effects on another positive interaction, the yucca/yucca moth mutualism.","[Snell, Rebecca S.; Addicott, John F.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Snell, RS (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Fac Forestry, 33 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B3, Canada.",rebecca.snell@utoronto.ca,,"Snell, Rebecca/0000-0002-2456-405X",Alberta Conservation Association; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC OperatingNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"Assistance in the field was provided by D.

Plants benefit when seed remaining in shallow caches germinates before being eaten, often gaining protection from beetles and a favorable microsite in the process. Caching in highly unfavorable microsites, conversely, could undermine the dispersal benefit for the plant. Plant invasions could disrupt dispersal benefits of seed caching by attracting rodents to the protection of a dense invasive canopy which inhibits the establishment of native seedlings beneath it. To determine whether rodents disproportionately cache seed under the dense canopy of an invasive grass in southeastern Arizona, we used nontoxic fluorescent powder and ultraviolet light to locate caches of seed offered to rodents in the field. We fitted a general habitat-use model, which showed that disproportionate use of plant cover by caching rodents (principally Chaetodipus spp.) increased with moonlight. Across all moon phases, when rodents cached under plants, they cached under the invasive grass disproportionately to its relative cover. A greenhouse experiment showed that proximity to the invasive grass reduced the growth and survival of seedlings of a common native tree (Parkinsonia microphylla) whose seeds are dispersed by caching rodents. Biased dispersal of native seed to the base of an invasive grass could magnify the competitive effect of this grass on native plants, further reducing their recruitment and magnifying the effect of the invasion.","[Sommers, Pacifica; Chesson, Peter] Univ Arizona, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Sommers, Pacifica] Univ Colorado, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Sommers, P (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.; Sommers, P (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",psommers@email.arizona.edu,,"Sommers, Pacifica/0000-0002-7797-7341",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1353715],"We wish to thank Mary Price, Judie Bronstein, and Robert Steidl for insight and important study design ideas.

We established two predator treatments (predator, no predator) by removing T. rutilus from all containers, and stocking T. rutilus larvae (1/3.5 liters) in the predator treatment. Removal and stocking was repeated every 3 d and established significantly different predator abundances in both large and small containers. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on standard samples showed larvae+pupae/liter of A. japonicus was greater without versus with predation, and this difference increased across samples. In contrast, repeated-measures ANOVA showed larvae+pupae/liter of A. triseriatus was statistically indistinguishable for predation treatments and was greater in small versus large containers. Thus, predation reduced invasive A. japonicus while having no detectable effect on A. triseriatus larvae and pupae. A final destructive census of pupae showed that predation reduced pupae/liter of both species, but this effect was greater and more consistent across container sizes for A. japonicus. Predator effects on abundances were not products of the nonlethal effect of predator avoidance by ovipositing females, as T. rutilus presence did not lead to reduced egg inputs by either Aedes, nor by Aedes spp. as a group. Effects of predation thus are best explained by differential success of developing larvae due to the greater lethal effect of T. rutilus on A. japonicus than on A. triseriatus. Thus, this system is consistent with the hypothesis that native predators can limit success and potential impacts of invasive mosquitoes.","[Juliano, Steven A.; Westby, Katie M.; Ower, Geoffrey D.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA; [Westby, Katie M.] Washington Univ St Louis, Tyson Res Ctr, 6750 Tyson Valley Rd, Eureka, MO 63025 USA; [Ower, Geoffrey D.] Univ Illinois, Prairie Res Inst, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, 1816 S Oak St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","Juliano, SA (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",sajulian@ilstu.edu,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553",National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease grant [1R15AI094322-01A1],"We thank J.

In order to determine whether these criticisms are justified, the different procedures employed in climatic mapping were reviewed, with examples taken from studies of the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata), Karnal bunt of wheat (Tilletia indica) and the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata). All these studies stressed the key role played by non-climatic factors in determining distribution but it was shown that these factors, e.g., the availability of food and synchrony with the host plant, together with the difficulties of downscaling and upscaling data, were different to those highlighted in the criticisms. The extent to which laboratory studies on Drosophila populations, on which the criticisms are based, can be extrapolated to general predictions of species distributions was also explored. The Drosophila experiments were found to illustrate the importance of climate but could not accurately determine potential species distributions because only adult and not breeding population densities were estimated. The experimental design overestimated species interactions and ignored other factors, such as the availability of food. It was concluded that while there are limitations, climatic mapping procedures continue to play a vital role in determining what G.E. Hutchinson defined as the fundamental niche in studies of potential distribution. This applies especially for pest species, where natural dispersal is generally less important than transport by man, and species interactions are limited by the impoverished species diversity in agroecosystems. Due to the lack of data, climatic mapping is often the only approach which can be adopted. Nevertheless, to ensure that non-climatic factors are not neglected in such studies, a standard framework should be employed. Such frameworks have already been developed for pest risk analyses and are suitable for general use in studies of potential distribution because, in order to justify the phytosanitary regulation of international trade, they must also consider the potential for pests to invade new areas and the impacts of such invasions.

In some species, males may cannibalize unrelated offspring or abandon the progeny when the uncertainty of paternity is high, or when they take over nest sites or females from other males. However, male protection of offspring can also evolve in situations of uncertainty of paternity, especially when males cannot recognize offspring relatedness. In such cases, males may take care of all their mate's offspring, regardless of paternity. In Manogea porracea (Araneidae), the only known spider species where males care for offspring, males repel competitors by assuming and defending specific positions within a female's web, but females accept multiple partners during the reproductive season. Consequently, males may care for some offspring produced with the sperm of their mate's previous partners. If males cannot detect offspring relatedness, we expect that they will not cannibalize progeny and will actively protect all offspring against predation. The main goal of this study was to investigate whether the extended male care depends on offspring relatedness recognition. Therefore, we experimentally manipulated offspring relatedness and the presence of foster males and two egg predators usually found invading M. porracea webs. We also compared our results with data from an experiment performed by Moura, Vasconcellos-Neto, & Gonzaga (2017) using the same laboratory procedures, but introducing egg sacs fathered exclusively by the males. Males did not cannibalize offspring and protected the progeny against predation regardless of offspring relatedness. In addition, all males moved the egg sacs to the center of the web, remaining close to the progeny. We conclude that M. porracea males protect all progeny present in their partner's web and increase offspring survivorship regardless of relatedness. We discuss the behavioral and evolutionary implications of our findings, and potential triggers of male care in M. porracea.","[Moura, Rafael Rios; Vasconcellos-Neto, Joao] Univ Estado Minas Gerais, Dept Ciencias Biol, Nucleo Extensao & Pesquisa Ecol & Evolucao NEPEE, Ituiutaba, Brazil; [Moura, Rafael Rios] Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Biol Anim, Campinas, Brazil; [Oliveira, Isabella Dias; Gonzaga, Marcelo Oliveira] Univ Fed Uberlandia, Inst Biol, Uberlandia, MG, Brazil","Moura, RR (corresponding author), Univ Estado Minas Gerais UEMG, Dept Ciencias Biol, R Ver Geraldo Moises da Silva S-N Univ, BR-38302192 Ituiutaba, MG, Brazil.",rafael.moura@uemg.br,"Moura, Rafael/B-4745-2016","Moura, Rafael/0000-0002-7911-4734","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [306157/2014-4, 403733/20120, 441225/2016-0, 445832/2014-2, 465562/2014-0]; Duratex S.A.; Fundacao de A mparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas GeraisFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) [APQ-02104-14, APQ-02984-17, APQ-03202-13, CRA-30058/12]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao PauloFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [465562/2014-0, 2017/14196-5]","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: 306157/2014-4, 403733/20120, 441225/2016-0, 445832/2014-2 and 465562/2014-0; Duratex S.A.; Fundacao de A mparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais, Grant/Award Number: APQ-02104-14, APQ-02984-17, APQ-03202-13 and CRA-30058/12; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo, Grant/Award Number: 2017/14196-5 and 465562/2014-0",,51,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,MAR,2021,127,3,,,,,223,230,,10.1111/eth.13112,,NOV 2020,8,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,QD0ZU,WOS:000590683200001,,,,,2021-09-27,

Facilitation via carrion provisioning, however, is a ubiquitous interaction among predators that could offset the strength of suppression. Understanding the relative importance of these positive and negative interactions is necessary to anticipate community-wide responses to apex predator declines and recoveries worldwide. Using state-sponsored wolf (Canis lupus) control in Alaska as a quasi experiment, we conducted snow track surveys of apex, meso-, and small predators to test for evidence of carnivore cascades (e.g., mesopredator release). We analyzed survey data using an integrative occupancy and structural equation modeling framework to quantify the strengths of hypothesized interaction pathways, and we evaluated fine-scale spatiotemporal responses of nonapex predators to wolf activity clusters identified from radio-collar data. Contrary to the carnivore cascade hypothesis, both meso- and small predator occupancy patterns indicated guild-wide, negative responses of nonapex predators to wolf abundance variations at the landscape scale. At the local scale, however, we observed a near guild-wide, positive response of nonapex predators to localized wolf activity. Local-scale association with apex predators due to scavenging could lead to landscape patterns of mesopredator suppression, suggesting a key link between occupancy patterns and the structure of predator communities at different spatial scales.","[Sivy, Kelly J.] Univ Alaska, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Pozzanghera, Casey B.] Boise State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Grace, James B.] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Lafayette, LA 70506 USA; [Prugh, Laura R.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Sivy, Kelly J.] 3820 Ullrbahn Rd, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA","Sivy, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Alaska, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.; Sivy, KJ (corresponding author), 3820 Ullrbahn Rd, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA.",kjsivy@alaska.edu,"Grace, James/B-8472-2009",,USGS Ecosystems and Climate and Land Use Change Programs; Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks; Alaska Energy Authority [RSA 1331]; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1652420]; Discover Denali Fellowship; NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [2012136814],"We thank all the human and canine field volunteers, community members, University of Alaska Fairbanks staff, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and National Park Service personnel who contributed time, resources, and effort toward this project.

This study was conducted to determine how smaller net mesh sizes to reduce entry of unwanted species inside the cages affects the production of Macrobrachium rosenbergii in lake-based cages. Juvenile prawns were stocked in cages (7 x 7 x 1.5 m) of two net mesh sizes at 10 individuals m(-2) and cultured for 10 months in a shallow eutrophic lake in the Philippines. The two net mesh sizes were either 5 mm-mesh B-nets or and 1 mm-mesh Hapa nets. Each treatment had four replicates each and was fed based on biomass with commercially formulated feed. Monitoring of various production parameters was done during the two phases of culture: batch phase on days 63 and 127 and the selective harvest phase on days 187, 219, 253, 281 and 313, when the experiment was terminated. For the first 127 days of culture, the weight, percent weight increase, daily growth rate (DGR), specific growth rate (SGR), yield and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were significantly better in prawns reared in the Hapa compared to the B-nets. During the selective harvest phase the blue claw, orange claw and berried females were selectively harvested and the remaining prawns returned to the cages. After changes in stocking density through culling, ANCOVA was used to compare the effect of mesh size with the total number of prawns returned to the cages as a covariate. Yield was significantly higher in the Hapa nets. Weight, DGR, SGR and FCR were also consistently higher in the Hapa nets, although not always significantly different. The overall better performance of prawns reared in the Hapa net cages was due to: (i) the reduction in the entry of predator and competitor species in the finer-meshed Hapa compared to the larger mesh B-net, (ii) more natural food trapped inside the Hapa cages, and (iii) a higher number of selectively harvested prawns, which decreased stocking density in the cages and improved growth. Use of small mesh size nets is recommended in the cage culture of M. rosenbergii in inland natural water bodies.","[Cuvin-Aralar, M. L. A.; Lazartigue, A. G.; Aralar, E.

In Amazonian upland rainforests, there are two sympatric species of the genus Phoneutria, P. reidyi (F.O. Pickard-Cambridge 1897) and P. fera Perty 1833. For 15 months we collected data on the spatial distribution, use of habitat (activity on the ground or vegetation) and temporal changes in body size structure in a forest reserve near Manaus city in three distinct habitats: dense forest, located on the plateaus on yellow latossol; swamp forest, located in the valleys; and heath forest or campinarana, on dry white sand soil in the Reserva Florestal Ducke. A total of 239 P. reidyi and 239 P. fera were captured in nocturnal searches during their period of activity. There were significant differences between the two species: 1) P. reidyi existed in higher abundance in the swamp forest than in the dense forest areas and was almost absent in the heath forest, while P. fera existed in similar abundance in the three habitats. 2) During their development, members of both species used the vegetation as an area of activity, but the subadults and adults of P. reiclyi were less often found on the ground than the subadults and adults of P. fera. 3) P. reidyi more frequently used small or acaulescent palms as a substrate, and its abundance was directly related to the abundance of these palms, independent of the habitat, while P. fera did not show such relationship. 4) There was a strong temporal variation in the body size structure of the P. reidyi population indicating seasonal reproduction, but there was no evidence of seasonal reproduction by P. fera. We suggest that the differences in the use of habitat and in the seasonality of reproduction are related to the avoidance of intraguild predation between these species.","[Torres-Sanchez, Martha Patricia] Univ Cent, Dept Ciencias Nat, Bogota, DC, Colombia; [Gasnier, Thierry Ray] Univ Fed Amazonas, ICB, Dept Biol, BR-69067000 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil","Torres-Sanchez, MP (corresponding author), Univ Cent, Dept Ciencias Nat, Carrera 5 21-38, Bogota, DC, Colombia.",mtorress@ucentral.edu.co,,,Brazilian institution CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Colombian institution COLFUTURO; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [400023/98],"This paper is part of the thesis of the first author in the post-graduation program of the Agreement between the Instituto Nacional de Pesquias do Amazonas (INPA) and the Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM).

Individual risk tolerance, or boldness, was measured as the time to resume movement after a simulated predation strike. Fish that resumed movement faster were categorized as bold, fish that took more time to resume movement were categorized as shy and those that fell in between these two categories were determined to have intermediate boldness. Competitive impacts of boldness in N. melanostomus were determined in a laboratory foraging experiment in which interspecific (juvenile Atlantic cod Gadus morhua Linnaeus 1758) and intraspecific (intermediate N. melanostomus) individuals were exposed to either bold or shy N. melanostomus competitors. G. morhua consumed fewer prey when competing with bold N. melanostomus than when competing with shy N. melanostomus, whereas intermediately bold N. melanostomus foraging was not affected by competitor boldness. Bold and shy N. melanostomus consumed similar amounts of prey, and the number of interactions between paired fish did not vary depending on the personality of N. melanostomus individuals. Therefore, intraspecific foraging competition was not found to be personality dependent. This study provides evidence that individual differences in boldness can mediate competitive interactions in N. melanostomus; nonetheless, results also show that competition is also governed by other mechanisms that require further study.","[Ericsson, Philip; Persson, Anders; von Friesen, Lisa W.; Nilsson, P.

In a series of microcosm experiments I empirically derived the functional response curves for two common types of stream predators, sculpins (Cottus bairdi) and stonefly larvae (Agnetina capitata), on two behaviorally and morphologically distinct types of mayfly prey (Baetis tricaudatus and Ephemerella subvaria). Data from these separate trials were combined using simple additive models to generate predicted combined functional responses for both types of predator. For both types of prey, actual combined functional response curves (both types of predators together in a treatment) differed significantly from predicted combined functional response for some ranges of prey densities. When Baetis was used as prey, significant departures from the predicted values occurred at moderate and high prey densities and were in a negative direction (interference between predators). When Ephemerella was the prey, significant departures occurred at low and moderate densities and were in a positive direction (facilitation between predators). Additive models for predicting combined predator effects cannot account for non-linearities in combined functional response introduced by non-trophic (behavioral) interactions that occur between fish and stoneflies, and between these predators and their prey.

Centaurea stoebe (spotted knapweed) is a notorious rangeland weed that exhibited regional declines in the early 2000s, attributed to drought by some and to successful biocontrol by others. We initiated an experiment to quantify the effects of the biocontrol agent, Cyphocleonus achates, on Ce. stoebe and its interaction with a dominant native grass competitor, Pseudoroegneria spicata, under contrasting precipitation conditions. Plots containing monocultures of each plant species or equal mixtures of the two received factorial combinations of Cy. achates herbivory (exclusion or addition) and precipitation (May-June drought or normal,'' defined by the 50-year average) for three years. Cy. achates herbivory reduced survival of adult Ce. stoebe plants by 9% overall, but this effect was stronger under normal precipitation compared to drought conditions, and stronger in mixed-species plots compared to monocultures. Herbivory had no effect on Ce. stoebe per capita seed production or on recruitment of seedlings or juveniles. In normal-precipitation plots of mixed composition, greater adult mortality due to Cy. achates herbivory resulted in increased recruitment of new adult Ce. stoebe. Due to this compensatory response to adult mortality, final Ce. stoebe densities did not differ between herbivory treatments regardless of context. Experimental drought reduced adult Ce. stoebe survival in mixed-species plots but did not impede recruitment of new adults or reduce final Ce. stoebe densities, perhaps due to the limited duration of the treatment. Ce. stoebe strongly depressed P. spicata reproduction and recruitment, but these impacts were not substantively alleviated by herbivory on Ce. stoebe. Population-level compensation by dominant plants may be an important factor inhibiting top-down effects in herbivore-driven and predator-driven cascades.","[Ortega, Yvette K.; Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.; Waller, Lauren P.; Maron, John L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Sturdevant, Nancy J.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Missoula, MT 59807 USA","Ortega, YK (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, 800 E Beckwith Ave, Missoula, MT 59801 USA.",yortega@fs.fed.us,,,USDA Forest Service Forest Health ProtectionUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Rocky Mountain Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Region 1,"We appreciate K.

The exclosure extended from an outpost of luxuriant sub-arctic birch forest to a typical arctic-alpine habitat complex, including productive willow scrublands, tundra heaths, dry ridges and snow-beds. The exclosure thus encompassed the entire range of habitat conditions encountered in a typical north Fennoscandian mountain and tundra landscapes. During 1991-95, the exclosure was predator-proof from late July to late September. In wintertime and in early summer, the exclosure was accessible to mammalian predators. Vole dynamics in the short-term exclosure were compared to dynamics in five reference areas with similar habitat conditions. In 1991, when vole densities were rising in the area, neither collective vole densities nor densities of individual vole species differed significantly between the exclosure and the replicated controls. Spring densities of voles were never significantly different between the exclosure and the controls. With respect to autumnal densities of voles, however, the exclosure was a statistical outlier in the peak year 1992 and throughout the gradual decline phase of 1993-95. In the peak year, the difference in collective vole densities was modest (30%), but increased to two-fold during the first two decline years and was almost four-fold in the crash year of 1995. The strongest response was displayed by field voles (Microtus agrestis), hypothesized to be the pivotal prey species of weasels, especially by females and young individuals, i.e. by the functional categories especially sensitive to mammalian predation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that predation plays a pivotal role for the regulation of herbivorous mammals in relatively productive arctic-alpine habitats.","Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden","Ekerholm, P (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",per.ekerholm@eg.umu.se,,,,,,96,31,32,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,2004,106,3,,,,,457,468,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12639.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,838OH,WOS:000222722200004,,,,,2021-09-27,

The effects of sparseness between individuals or the effect of predators on the probability of population growth can be difficult to measure experimentally. For testing hypotheses about population density and predation, we contend that habitat complexity can be simulated using insect mazes of varying mathematical difficulty. To demonstrate the concept, we investigated whether the use of 3D printed mazes of varying complexity could be used to increase spatial separation between sexes of Drosophila simulans, and whether the presence of a generalist predator hampered mate-finding. We then examined how increasing D. simulans population density might overcome the artificially created effects of increasing the distance between mates and having a predator present. As expected, there was an increase in time taken to find a mate and a lower incidence of mating as habitat complexity increased. Increasing the density of flies reduced the searching time and increased mating success, and overcame the effect of the predator in the maze. Printable 3D mazes offer the opportunity to quickly assess the effects of spatial separation on insect population growth in the laboratory, without the need for large enclosed spaces. Mazes could be scaled up for larger insects and can be used for other applications such as learning.","[Stringer, Lloyd D.; Sullivan, Nicola J.; White, Robyn; Furlong, Jess; Suckling, David Maxwell] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Christchurch PB 4704, New Zealand; [Stringer, Lloyd D.; Sullivan, Nicola J.; Kean, John M.; Suckling, David Maxwell] Better Border Biosecur B3, Lincoln 7608, New Zealand; [Stringer, Lloyd D.; Beggs, Jacqueline R.; Suckling, David Maxwell] Univ Auckland, Ctr Biodivers & Biosecur, Sch Biol Sci, PB 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Jimenez-Perez, Alfredo] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Desarrollo Prod Biot, Yautepec 62731, Mexico; [Kean, John M.] AgResearch, PB 3123, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand","Stringer, LD (corresponding author), New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Christchurch PB 4704, New Zealand.; Stringer, LD (corresponding author), Better Border Biosecur B3, Lincoln 7608, New Zealand.; Stringer, LD (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Ctr Biodivers & Biosecur, Sch Biol Sci, PB 92019, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",Lloyd.stringer@plantandfood.co.nz; Nicola.Sullivan@plantandfood.co.nz; Robyn.White@plantandfood.co.nz; aljimenez@ipn.mx; Jess4long@gmail.com; john.kean@agresearch.co.nz; j.beggs@auckland.ac.nz; Max.Suckling@plantandfood.co.nz,"Kean, John/A-1956-2008; Beggs, Jacqueline/I-3796-2014; Suckling, David/F-7005-2010; Sullivan, Nicola/O-8426-2017","Kean, John/0000-0002-4012-1048; Beggs, Jacqueline/0000-0002-2112-2803; Stringer, Lloyd/0000-0002-6345-0768; Suckling, David/0000-0001-7216-9348; Sullivan, Nicola/0000-0001-8014-9945; Jimenez-Perez, Alfredo/0000-0002-6170-746X",,,,24,0,0,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,APR,2020,11,4,,,,,,,256,10.3390/insects11040256,,,10,Entomology,Entomology,LO8YE,WOS:000533910800030,32326018,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-27,

Can a species' response to different spatial and temporal heterogeneities be placed in a common currency? Is it possible to rank the relative importance of different habitat features on the organism's behavior and ecology? Do the effects of different spatial and temporal heterogeneities interact in predictable ways? To address these questions, we quantified hyrax habitat use at a series of rocky outcrops (koppies) and an isolated gorge in Augrabies Falls National Park, South Africa. We measured the hyraxes' perceptions of feeding opportunities and costs using giving-up densities (GUDs) within experimental food patches. At very small spatial scales (2-3 m), we tested whether hyraxes have lower GUDs under cover (shrubs or rocks) or 2-3 m away in the open. Hyraxes valued cover highly, consistently showing lower GUDs in cover microhabitats. This preference did not result from differences in energetic costs, as hyraxes did not track sun in winter or shade in summer. At moderate spatial scales (10-80 m), we tested whether hyraxes act as central place foragers with lower GUDs closer to their dens. GUDs increased with increasing distance to dens at four koppies, but not at the gorge. At larger spatial scales, preferences differed between colonies based on differences in habitat structure, with hyraxes on similar structures (koppies) behaving similarly. We evaluated how foraging costs varied with temporal heterogeneity within the day, among days, and among seasons. Hyraxes showed their lowest GUDs in the early mornings and late afternoons. Hyraxes shifted foraging locations among days, which may result from sentinels shifting location on consecutive days and/or hyraxes managing their food. Differences between GUDs during the various sample periods were not seasonally correlated. We conclude that spatial and temporal habitat utilization by hyraxes may be driven more by predation risk rather than other costs.","Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa; Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Zool, Ctr African Conservat Ecol, ZA-6013 Port Elizabeth, South Africa; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Miltrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel; S African Natl Pk, ZA-6013 Port Elizabeth, South Africa","Druce, DJ (corresponding author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Biol & Conservat Sci, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa.",davedruce@gmail.com,"Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012; Kerley, Graham I H/B-7774-2009; Slotow, Rob/AAM-9053-2020; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012; Castley, James Guy/A-7056-2010","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; Castley, James Guy/0000-0002-8418-5828; Druce, Dave/0000-0003-2976-6029; Slotow, Rob/0000-0001-9469-1508",,,,39,32,32,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,DEC,2006,115,3,,,,,513,525,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.15179.x,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,106PW,WOS:000242114200013,,,,,2021-09-27,

In recent years, the number of noncommercial poultry has been on the rise in the United States. To evaluate potential risks of this growing population, a descriptive epidemiologic survey was conducted among Maryland backyard flocks. Owner and flock demographics were characterized as well as management practices such as husbandry, human-to-bird interaction, bird exposure risks, poultry health status, and biosecurity. Data from the 41 returned questionnaires indicated a median flock size of 38 birds (range, 3-901). Chickens accounted for 86.5% of the reported birds overall. Just over half of the owners (51.2%) kept chickens only, with the remaining backyard flocks consisting of chickens, other gallinaceous species, waterfowl, or a combination. Of flocks with multiple species, 70.0% of owners did not keep them separate. Almost two thirds of owners (61.0%) had kept poultry for <= 5 yr, with 44.0% of all flocks on free range. Over the past 2 yr, predation was the highest cause of specific mortality (57.1%) followed by disease (30.2%), unknown (8.7%), and injury (4.0%), and over half of owners (56.1%) reported signs of disease in their flock within the last 6 mo. Biosecurity practices were highly variable among flocks. Data from this study identified gaps in the disease prevention and biosecurity practices of backyard flocks. These results can be useful in developing educational extension and outreach programs as well as policies, in efforts to further mitigate the spread of diseases.","[Madsen, Jennifer M.; Tablante, Nathaniel L.] Univ Maryland, Virginia Maryland Reg Coll Vet Med, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Zimmermann, Nickolas G.] Univ Maryland, Dept Anim & Avian Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Timmons, Jennifer] Univ Maryland Eastern Shore, Dept Agr Food & Resource Sci, Princess Anne, MD 21853 USA","Tablante, NL (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Virginia Maryland Reg Coll Vet Med, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",nlt@umd.edu,,,Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station Competitive Grants Program,We thank all those at the MDA who helped make this project possible as well as the Maryland backyard flock owners who participated in this study.

I monitored tadpole growth rate in a number of rock-pools differing in size, competitors and predator regime. Furthermore, I carried out a short-term field experiment to investigate the effects of different predators on larval survival. Rana bred in pools of virtually all sizes, although the very smallest ones were usually avoided. A logistic regression analysis showed that the amount of aquatic macrophyte vegetation and pool surface area were the most important pool characters for Rana. Bufo preferred the largest pools, and pool surface area was by far the most important habitat variable. Rana avoided pools with the lowest pH, but was more common than expected at pools with pH around 6. In Bufo such an effect was not found, but this may be due to relatively low number of pools occupied by Bufo. In Rana there was a positive correlation between pool area and tadpole body length in early June, but two weeks later this relationship was not significant. In Bufo tadpole body size was not significantly affected by pool area. Presence of predators or presence of the other tadpole species did not affect growth or tadpole body size in either Rana or Bufo. A short-term experiment in wading pools indicated that both species suffered heavy mortality in the presence of a diving beetle larva. In the presence of predatory fish, mortality of Bufo did not differ from controls, whereas mortality was high among Rana tadpoles. It appears that although predators prey heavily on Rana tadpoles, they do not exclude Rana from larger rock-pools. However, it is not evident from this study why Bufo avoids smaller pools.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Ecol & Systemat, Div Populat Biol, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Laurila, A (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Ecol & Systemat, Div Populat Biol, POB 17, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",anssi.laurila@helsinki.fi,,,,,,45,52,61,0,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0906-7590,,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,OCT,1998,21,5,,,,,484,494,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.1998.tb00440.x,,,11,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,134AV,WOS:000076721000006,,,,,2021-09-27,

Accordingly, different trophic groups are expected to vary in their N-limitation depending on the extent to which they feed primarily on carbohydrate (CHO) or protein. Among arboreal ants, N-limitation ranges from high (for trophobiont tenders), intermediate (leaf foragers) and low (predators). We report results from a manipulative field experiment in a Brazilian savanna that tests the differential attractiveness of nitrogen and CHO to arboreal ants, as well as experimentally examines changes in broader ant foraging patterns in response to protein and CHO supplementation. Every tree within 32 20x20m plots were supplemented with either protein, CHO; protein+CHO or a water control (n=8 in each case) for a 7-day period in each of the wet and dry seasons. As predicted, different trophic groups responded differentially to supplementation treatment according to the extent of their N-limitation. The richness and abundance of the most N-limited group (trophobiont tenders) was highest at protein supplements, whereas less N-limited trophic groups showed highest species richness (leaf foragers) or abundance (predators) at CHO supplements. Protein supplementation markedly increased the general foraging abundance of trophobiont tenders, but decreased the abundance of leaf foragers. We attribute the latter to increased competition from behaviorally dominant trophobiont tenders. Our study provides experimental evidence that nutrient availability is a major factor influencing arboreal ant communities, both directly through the provision of different resources, and indirectly through increased competitive pressure.","[Ribeiro, Laila F.] Univ Fed Vicosa, Programa Posgrad Entomol, Ave PH Rolfs S-N,Campus Univ, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Solar, Ricardo R.

Overcompensation can contribute to the Hydra effect, wherein added mortality increases equilibrium population size. One hypothesis for overcompensation is that added mortality eases density dependence, increasing survival to adulthood (temporal separation of mortality and density dependence). Mortality early in the life cycle is therefore predicted to cause overcompensation, whereas mortality later in the life cycle is not. Another hypothesis for overcompensation is that threat of mortality (e.g., from predation) causes behavioral changes that reduce overexploitation of resources, allowing resource recovery, and increasing production of adults (prudent resource exploitation). Behaviorally active predation cues alone are therefore predicted to cause overcompensation. We tested these predictions in two experiments with larvae of two species of Aedes. As predicted, early mortality yielded greater production of adults, and of adult females, and greater estimated rate of population increase than did later mortality. Addition of water-borne predation cues usually reduced browsing on surfaces in late-stage larvae, but contrary to prediction, resulted in neither significantly greater production of adult mosquitoes nor significantly greater estimated rate of increase. Thus we have strong evidence that timing of mortality contributes to overcompensation and the Hydra effect in mosquitoes. Evidence that predation cues alone can result in overcompensation via prudent resource exploitation is lacking. We expect the overcompensation in response to early mortality will be common in organisms with complex life cycles, density dependence among juveniles, and developmental control of populations.","[McIntire, Kristina M.; Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Juliano, SA (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",sajulian@ilstu.edu,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553; McIntire, Kristina/0000-0002-1387-5637","NIAIDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [1R15AI094322-01A1, 1R15AI124005-01]; Illinois State University's office of Research and Sponsored Programs; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI094322, R15AI124005] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank K.

Marking agents are required to enable the identification of individuals that consume the baits in order to evaluate and optimize the cost-efficacy of baiting campaigns. Ethyl-iophenoxic acid (Et-IPA) is an organic iodine-containing compound that has been used increasingly since the 1980s as a bait marker. It binds to proteins in animal blood and therefore can be detected indirectly by measuring plasma or serum iodine concentration or directly by measuring plasma or serum Et-IPA concentration with liquid chromatography. Methyl-iophenoxic acid and propyl-iophenoxic acid can also be used to provide quantitative information on temporal or spatial patterns of bait consumption in a range of mammalian species. We review the suitability of Et-IPA and its analogues as bait markers in mammals. The highly variable persistence of analogues and in species highlights the need for calibration testing of each compound as a marker for each species and for each proposed use before starting a bait delivery trial. After absorption, the fate of IPAs (by metabolism, distribution and excretion) is variable, but most are bound to plasma proteins. Marking efficacy is therefore high. The implications of exposure to IPAs for predators and humans were analyzed to evaluate its safety for delivery to wild mammals. Although it is highly unlikely that secondary exposure through ingestion could involve sufficiently large quantities to produce adverse effects, further studies are necessary to assess long-term effects after chronic exposure to these compounds. IPAs can mark animal serum for long periods of time, and improvements in detection methods for them are currently being developed, so that they are a good choice for oral baiting field experiments with mammals.","[Ballesteros, Cristina; Mateo, Rafael; De La Fuente, Jose; Gortazar, Christian] IREC CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain; [Sage, Mickael; Rossi, Sophie] Game & Wildlife Agcy, Off Natl Chasse & Faune Sauvage, Wildlife Sanit Unit, F-67150 Gerstheim, France; [Fisher, Penny] Landcare Res, Pest Control Technol Team, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Massei, Giovanna] Food & Environm Res Agcy, York YO41 1LZ, N Yorkshire, England; [De La Fuente, Jose] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Vet Pathobiol, Ctr Vet Hlth Sci, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Ballesteros, C (corresponding author), IREC CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget, Ronda de Toledo S-N, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain.",Cristina.ballesteros@uclm.es; mickael.sage@oncfs.gouv.fr; FisherP@landcareresearch.co.nz; Giovanna.Massei@fera.gsi.gov.uk; Rafael.Mateo@uclm.es; jose_delafuente@yahoo.com; sophie.rossi@oncfs.gouv.fr; Christian.Gortazar@uclm.es,"Fisher, Penny/AAA-8584-2019; Massei, Giovanna/B-8781-2016; Mateo, Rafael/AAU-1480-2020; Gortazar, Christian/E-7918-2012; Mateo, Rafael/A-3117-2011","Fisher, Penny/0000-0003-1268-4537; Mateo, Rafael/0000-0003-1307-9152; Gortazar, Christian/0000-0003-0012-4006; Mateo, Rafael/0000-0003-1307-9152",French Ministry of Agriculture; European Community's Seventh Framework Programme [FP7/2007-2013]; TB-STEP [212414]; Grupo Santander; Fundacion Marcelino Botin (Spain); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad Plan National (Spain) [AGL2011-30041]; ERDF: European Regional Development Fund,"We received support from the French Ministry of Agriculture.

Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus, 1758), the diamondback moth (DBM), is a well-known and destructive insect pest of brassicaceous crops worldwide. Here, we analyzed the functional responses of four spiders (Araneae) - Ebrechtella tricuspidata (Fabricius, 1775) (Thomisidae), Pardosa laura (Karsch, 1879) (Lycosidae), Pardosa astrigera (Koch, 1878) (Lycosidae), and Pardosa pseudoannulata (Bosenberg & Strand, 1906) (Lycosidae) - on P. xylostella larvae. We also analyzed intraspecific disturbances in the predation reaction and the intensity of scrambling competition of the spiders to P. xylostella larvae. Our results demonstrated that the functional responses of four spiders of different genera were in line with the Holling II model. Two Lycosidae spiders (P. astrigera and P. pseudoannulata) had the potential to control P. xylostella, and female and male spiders that belonged to the same species had different functional responses to P. xylostella. The functional responses of female predation of P. astrigena, P. laura, and P. pseudoannulata was stronger than the males, but male E. tricuspidatus had stronger functional responses to predation than females. We used the Hassell model to describe the intraspecific disturbance experiments of four spiders. There were intraspecific disturbances in the predation reactions of spiders, indicating that the predation ratio of spiders decreased in relation to the increase of its density, and with the increase of spider density, the intensity of scrambling competition of the spider increased.","[Huang, Xuan; Quan, Xiaoyu; Wang, Xia; Yun, Yueli; Peng, Yu] Hubei Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hubei Collaborat Innovat Ctr Green Transformat Bi, Wuhan 430062, Hubei, Peoples R China","Peng, Y (corresponding author), Hubei Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hubei Collaborat Innovat Ctr Green Transformat Bi, Wuhan 430062, Hubei, Peoples R China.",pengyu@hubu.edu.cn,,"Peng, Yu/0000-0003-1454-0799",National Natural Science Fund of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31672317]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0200900]; International Cooperation Projects of Hubei Province Science and Technology Agency [2016AHB003],"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Fund of China (process 31672317), National Key Research and Development Program of China (process 2016YFD0200900), and the International Cooperation Projects of Hubei Province Science and Technology Agency (process 2016AHB003).",,30,1,3,2,6,"SOC BRASILEIRA ZOOLOGIA, UNIV FEDERAL PARANA",CURITIBA,"CAIXA POSTAL 19020, CURITIBA, PARANA 81531-980, BRAZIL",1984-4689,,,ZOOLOGIA-CURITIBA,Zoologia,,2018,35,,,,,,,,e23481,10.3897/zoologia.35.e23481,,,6,Zoology,Zoology,GR7WO,WOS:000442908800001,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-27,

We studied the response of common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) pairs and broods to pH, perch (Perca fluviatilis) density and invertebrate abundance in small forest lakes in southern Finland. Neither the density of breeding pairs nor that of broods showed an overall trend with lake acidity but both of them increased with invertebrate abundance. Among three lakes studied in more detail for several years both pair density and brood density were highest in the lake with lowest pH and perch density and highest invertebrate abundance. Goldeneye brood density, but not pair density, increased after a sudden perch death in an experimental lake. Our results indicate that both breeding pairs and broods of goldeneyes may benefit of acidity-induced release in food competition after the disappearance of fish competitors.","FINNISH GAME & FISHERIES RES INST,EVO STATE FISHERIES & AQUACULTURE RES STN,SF-16970 EVO,FINLAND; UNIV HELSINKI,DEPT APPL ZOOL,SF-00014 HELSINKI,FINLAND","POYSA, H (corresponding author), FINNISH GAME & FISHERIES RES INST,EVO GAME RES STN,KAITALAMMINTIE 75,SF-16970 EVO,FINLAND.",,"Poysa, Hannu/C-2601-2014; Nummi, Petri/AAU-9666-2021",,,,,33,17,17,0,4,FINNISH ZOOLOGICAL BOTANICAL PUBLISHING BOARD,HELSINKI,"UNIV HELSINKI P O BOX 17 (P.

Even though the significance of fishes as top predators is recognized, the diet of many of them is still scarcely known; especially in fish that inhabit shallow lakes densely vegetated. The aim of this study was to investigate the diet of Characidium rachovii and Pyrrhulina australis of different size classes (I, II and III); during winter and summer, and estimate their trophic niche breadth. The field work was carried out in two shallow lakes fed by rain (Soto and Pampin lake, Corrientes province), from July 2011 to August 2012. The stomach contents of 104 individuals of C. rachovii and 91 specimens of P. australis were examined. Accumulation curve showed that the number of analyzed stomachs was representative for both species. Twenty three food items for C. rachovii and twenty eight for P. australis were recognized in the gut contents. According to the index of relative importance (IRI), both species feed preferably on cladocerans and midges (Chironomidae), and both species showed a large overlap in their diets (85 %), according to Morisita index. However the diversity of food items and the trophic niche breadth of P. australis (D-1 = 8.86; B = 4.76) were higher than C. rachovii (D-1 = 3.37; B = 2.25). Significant differences were observed in the diet of three sizes of P. australis (chi 2, p < 0.01) and between the sizes I and III of C. rachovii (chi 2, p = 0.03). In both species the diversity of food items increased with increasing their size. Between seasons, the diet differences were significant for both species (chi 2, p < 0.0001). The high feeding overlap indicates that both species mostly use the same resources. Notwithstanding this, both the number of food items as the diversity and breadth of the trophic niche, suggest that these species use different feeding strategies, C. rachovii showed a trend towards specialization in microcrustacean consumption; while P. australis exhibited a broader trophic spectrum, incorporating insects from littoral areas and from the terrestrial community. The loss of the trophic dominant resource, by increasing urbanization on the margin of the studied shallow lakes, could lead to increased competition, due to the wide diet overlap in both species.","[Ibarra Polesel, Mario Gabriel; Guadalupe Poi, Alicia Susana] CCT Nordeste CONICET UNNE, Ctr Ecol Aplicada Litoral, CECOAL, Ruta 5 Km 2-5, RA-3400 Corrientes, Argentina; [Ibarra Polesel, Mario Gabriel] Univ Nacl Nordeste, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat & Agrimensura, Catedra Biol Artropodos, Avda Libertad 5470, RA-3400 Corrientes, Argentina","Polesel, MGI (corresponding author), CCT Nordeste CONICET UNNE, Ctr Ecol Aplicada Litoral, CECOAL, Ruta 5 Km 2-5, RA-3400 Corrientes, Argentina.; Polesel, MGI (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Nordeste, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat & Agrimensura, Catedra Biol Artropodos, Avda Libertad 5470, RA-3400 Corrientes, Argentina.",guadalupepoi@gmail.com; mario.ibarrapolesel@gmail.com,,"Ibarra Polesel, Mario Gabriel/0000-0002-3211-4438",,,,43,3,3,0,3,REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL,SAN JOSE,"UNIVERSIDAD DE COSTA RICA CIUDAD UNIVERSITARIA, SAN JOSE, 00000, COSTA RICA",0034-7744,2215-2075,,REV BIOL TROP,Rev.

Because no extra traits need to evolve, spatial and temporal differentiation may readily take place to complement other isolating mechanisms. Two closely related treefrog species occur together in Korea: the endangered Hyla suweonensis and the widespread Hyla japonica. Advertisement calls are differentiated, but it is unclear whether call difference is sufficient for reproductive isolation. We tracked individuals of both species to study fine-scale differentiation in microhabitat use in the diel cycle of the breeding season using a harmonic direction finder. tracking male movement patterns of both species revealed spatial and temporal differentiation in microhabitat use for calling and resting during the breeding season. Males of both H. suweonensis and H. japonica occurred in all 5 microhabitats identified in this study: rice paddy, ground, buried, grass and bush. Both treefrog species showed general similarities in calling from rice paddies and resting in grass and bush. However, H. suweonensis moved into rice paddies and produced advertisement calls 3 h earlier than H. japonica. These differences likely minimize contact between the species and provide an additional isolating mechanism. In addition, the activity of H. suweonensis may be contributing to the decline of this species, as resting in grass would increase dangers from predatory birds and habitat disturbance.","[Borzee, Amael; Kim, Jun Young; Da Cunha, Marina Andrade Martins; Lee, Donggeun; Sin, Eunchong; Oh, Sunmin; Yi, Yoonjung; Jang, Yikweon] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Life Sci, Seoul 120750, South Korea; [Borzee, Amael; Kim, Jun Young; Da Cunha, Marina Andrade Martins; Lee, Donggeun; Sin, Eunchong; Oh, Sunmin; Yi, Yoonjung; Jang, Yikweon] Ewha Womans Univ, Div EcoSci, Seoul 120750, South Korea; [Jang, Yikweon] Ewha Womans Univ, Interdisciplinary Program EcoCreat, Seoul, South Korea; [Borzee, Amael] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Seoul 151, South Korea","Jang, Y (corresponding author), Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Life Sci, Seoul 120750, South Korea.; Jang, Y (corresponding author), Ewha Womans Univ, Div EcoSci, Seoul 120750, South Korea.",jangy@ewha.ac.kr,"Borzee, Amael/P-6247-2018","Borzee, Amael/0000-0003-1093-677X; Yi, Yoonjung/0000-0003-0845-5635",National Research Foundation of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea [2012R1A2A2A01046977],We are grateful to Han Hyojeong for her help during field work and to Jonathan J.

Open algal bioreactors fertilized with wastewater can have net energy gain but are vulnerable to colonization by algal grazers. However, colonizing predaceous insects may limit grazer impacts on algae. Here, we investigate the effects of grazers, predators, and invading algae species on algal production and community structure in high-nutrient environments. First, we grew diverse algal assemblages in treated municipal wastewater in a greenhouse with Daphnia grazers and different insect predators that were added experimentally. When Daphnia were present without predators, they eliminated suspended algae. But, dragonfly larvae [Odonata: Libellulidae] and backswimmers [Hemiptera: Notonectidae], but not larval diving beetles [Coloeoptera: Dytiscidae], suppressed Daphnia allowing suspended algae to persist. Second, we grew Chlorella algae in field tanks that were open or protected from natural invertebrate colonization and half the tanks received wild-collected plankton in a factorial design. Mosquito larvae [Culex sp.] readily colonized open tanks and reduced algal mass and dissolved phosphorus concentrations. Colonist addition to open tanks shifted algal functional and taxonomic composition but did not impact suspended algal production. Our study indicates that large numbers of grazer individuals can rapidly colonize open bioreactors. Experimentally added and naturally colonizing grazers altered algal community structure and reduced algal standing crops but may also aid in nutrient removal from wastewater-fed bioreactors. Effective operation of open algal bioreactors must consider cultivated algae species' vulnerability to competition and local grazers as well as the ability of potential predators to both naturally disperse into bioreactors and to control grazers.","[Thom, Alexandra E.; Bhattacharjee, Meenakshi; Siemann, Evan] Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, 6100 South Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Siemann, E (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, 6100 South Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",siemann@rice.edu,,,,,,53,3,3,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,1573-5125,,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

This region is also among the fastest-warming areas on the planet, with 5-6 degrees C increases in mean winter air temperatures and associated decreases in winter sea-ice cover. These biological and physical perturbations have affected the ecosystem profoundly. One hypothesis guiding ecological interpretations of changes in top predator populations in this region, the sea-ice hypothesis, proposes that reductions in winter sea ice have led directly to declines in ice-loving species by decreasing their winter habitat, while populations of ice-avoiding species have increased. However, 30 y of field studies and recent surveys of penguins throughout the WAP and Scotia Sea demonstrate this mechanism is not controlling penguin populations; populations of both ice-loving Adelie and ice-avoiding chinstrap penguins have declined significantly. We argue in favor of an alternative, more robust hypothesis that attributes both increases and decreases in penguin populations to changes in the abundance of their main prey, Antarctic krill. Unlike many other predators in this region, Adelie and chinstrap penguins were never directly harvested by man; thus, their population trajectories track the impacts of biological and environmental changes in this ecosystem. Linking trends in penguin abundance with trends in krill biomass explains why populations of Adelie and chinstrap penguins increased after competitors (fur seals, baleen whales, and some fishes) were nearly extirpated in the 19th to mid-20th centuries and currently are decreasing in response to climate change.","[Trivelpiece, Wayne Z.; Hinke, Jefferson T.; Miller, Aileen K.; Reiss, Christian S.; Trivelpiece, Susan G.; Watters, George M.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Antarctic Ecosyst Res Div, SW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Hinke, Jefferson T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Trivelpiece, WZ (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Antarctic Ecosyst Res Div, SW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",Wayne.Trivelpiece@noaa.gov,", Jefferson/AAG-1702-2021",", Jefferson/0000-0002-3600-1414",NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Science Foundation's Office of Polar ProgramsNational Science Foundation (NSF); Pew Charitable Trusts; Oceanites Foundation,This research was conducted as part of the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The potential scale, pace and consequences of this global change have been modelled extensively(2), yet little empirical research has quantified the impacts of extreme climate events on the composition of contemporary ecological communities. Here, we quantified the responses of 423 sympatric species of plants, arthropods, birds, reptiles and mammals to California's drought of 2012-2015-the driest period in the past 1,200 years(3) for this global biodiversity hotspot. Plants were most responsive to one-year water deficits, whereas vertebrates responded to longer-term deficits, and extended drought had the greatest impact on carnivorous animals. Locally rare species were more likely to increase in numbers and abundant species were more likely to decline in response to drought, and this negative density dependence was remarkably consistent across taxa and drought durations. Our system-wide analysis reveals that droughts indirectly promote the long-term persistence of rare species by stressing dominant species throughout the food web. These findings highlight processes that shape community structure in highly variable environments and provide insights into whole-community responses to modern climate volatility.","[Prugh, Laura R.; Deguines, Nicolas] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Grinath, Joshua B.; Suding, Katherine N.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Grinath, Joshua B.] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Biol, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 USA; [Bean, William T.] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Wildlife, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Stafford, Robert] Calif Dept Fish & Wildlife, Los Osos, CA USA; [Brashares, Justin S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Prugh, LR (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",lprugh@uw.edu,"Grinath, Joshua/R-7139-2019; Deguines, Nicolas/N-7818-2018","Grinath, Joshua/0000-0002-7116-3523; Deguines, Nicolas/0000-0001-6930-916X","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1628754, DEB-1354931, DEB-1355055]; USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); BLM; USFWSUS Fish & Wildlife Service; Nature Conservancy; CDFW","This study was funded by a collaborative NSF grant to L.R.P.

Ecological factors that alter mortality rates, such as predation, can cause evolutionary change. However, in addition to killing prey, predators can reduce prey abundance and increase food to survivors. Such indirect effects may also cause evolution. Predictions from theory that models how life histories evolve in response to increased mortality rates often change when they include indirect effects. Thus, indirect effects need to be evaluated to couple theory with natural systems. 2. Trinidadian killifish, Rivulus hartii, are found in communities with and without guppies Poecilia reticulata. Rivulus densities decline when guppies are present, which may be due to competitive or predatory interactions with guppies that increase Rivulus mortality rates. We previously showed that Rivulus from sites with guppies begin reproduction earlier and have increased reproductive allotment compared to Rivulus from sites with just Rivulus. Such divergence is inconsistent with theory that considers changes in juvenile mortality alone, but is consistent with theory that incorporates indirect effects. Here, we explored the mechanism of divergence with mark-recapture studies that compared the population biology of Rivulus between communities that are and are not sympatric with guppies. 3. Rivulus were 50% less abundant when guppies were present but guppies were not associated with increased adult mortality rates. Related experiments show that the declines in density are likely due to guppy predation on young Rivulus. Guppies do not appear to negatively impact Rivulus growth via competition. Rivulus with guppies grow > 3x faster than Rivulus from sites upstream, above waterfalls that exclude guppies. If guppies competed with Rivulus for resources, then we would instead expect to see their presence be associated with a decline in Rivulus growth rates. When Rivulus were transplanted from above to below this barrier, their growth accelerated to match the residents. This response instead argues that the differences in growth are mediated by an environmental factor, likely lower population densities, which allow Rivulus from sites with guppies to grow faster. 4. These results imply that an indirect effect of guppy predation on young Rivulus, which is the presumed agent of selection, improves the fit of empirical findings with theoretical predictions.","[Walsh, Matthew R.; Bassar, Ronald D.; Reznick, David N.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Fraser, Douglas F.] Siena Coll, Dept Biol, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA","Walsh, MR (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",matthew.walsh@yale.edu,,"reznick, david/0000-0002-1144-0568","Explorers Club Exploration Grant; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB0808039, DEB0416085, EF0623632, DEB0108365]","We would like to thank Matthew Schrader, Christopher Oufiero, Jose Rodriguez, Ramon Rodriguez, E.

A total of 1268 specimens 31-140 mm in total length were analysed. Growth was well described by both standard and seasonalized forms of the von Bertalanffy growth model and the computed parameters were L infinity=152 mm, k=0.36, t(o)= -0.57. Feeding intensity was high throughout the study period and varied significantly among the age classes of fish examined. Stomach content analysis revealed that S. hepatus is carnivorous, feeding mainly on decapods. Diets did not vary seasonally; decapods were the most important prey throughout the year. However, the composition of the prey consumed varied considerably with predator age coupled with differences in mean prey sizes utilized by each age class. The mean weight of stomach contents increased significantly for older specimens, while the mean number of prey items decreased. Age-specific dietary selection was primarily a function of body size of the predator and appears to reduce intra-specific competition among the members of the different age classes. The results suggest that S. hepatus plays an important trophic role as a macrophagic carnivorous species on the Cretan continental shelf.

With the increase in seal numbers, increased conflict with fisheries has occurred through depredation and the belief that seals compete with fisheries for prey. However, competition can only be determined if the prey species and quantities seals consume over time are known. We studied the diet of harbour seals in Erimo, site of the largest population of harbour seals in Japan, from 2011 to 2012 and assessed the degree of prey overlap with local fisheries. We used both hard parts and DNA techniques to identify prey items in seal scats, and compared these results to local fisheries data. A total of 46 prey occurrences was detected by both methods, of which 17 matched between techniques at least to the family level. Hard parts methods identified five incidences of prey undetected by DNA methods in five scats (one incidence per scat). DNA methods identified 24 additional prey occurrences in 13 scats, for which no hard part evidence for that prey had been found. This more than doubled the total number of prey occurrences across the 15 scats compared. Overall, the most frequently occurring harbour seal prey were walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), sculpins and snailfishes. In contrast, the top three groups targeted by fisheries were codfishes, salmon and invertebrates. Many species common in the harbour seal's diet such as snailfishes and blennies were not targeted by fisheries. Fishes such as greenlings, sculpins, rockfishes and Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) were common in the diet of harbour seals, but made up a very small proportion of fisheries catches in Erimo. The importance of other prey species varied between seasons. Sculpins, greenlings and forage fishes were the top three prey groups for harbour seals in spring by percent modified frequency of occurrence, whereas the most important target groups by percentage mass caught by fisheries were codfishes, cephalopods and other invertebrates. Sculpins and rockfishes remained as important prey items for harbour seals in summer and autumn, in addition to codfishes, snailfishes and blennies. In contrast, the main groups caught by fisheries in summer were other fishes, particularly Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata) and various species of sharks and eels, and invertebrates. By autumn, Erimo fisheries had focussed on catching salmon. Salmon were taken by harbour seals as well during this period, but at a relatively lower frequency compared to other prey groups. The results of our study show that although harbour seals consumed several of the prey species targeted by fisheries, the relative importance of these species to seals and fisheries and the seasons in which they were targeted were different.","[Hui, Tabitha C.

Samplings were done using pitfall trapping. Twenty species of ants and 44 species of spiders were identified. The most abundant were: Aphaenogaster gibbosa (Latreille 1798), Aphaenogaster iberica Emery 1908, Cataglyphis hispanica (Emery 1906), Cataglyphis iberica (Emery 1906), Messor barbarus (L. 1767) and Tapinoma nigerrimum (Nylander 1856) which totalized 71.21% of ants; and Alopecosa albofasciata (Brulle 1832), Callilepis concolor Simon 1914, Eratigena feminea Simon 1870, Zodarion alacre (Simon 1870) and Zodarion styliferum (Simon 1870) which accounted for 38% of spiders. Three Iberian endemic ants and nine Iberian endemic spiders were also identified. Abundance of both ant-mimicking and ant-eating spiders were positively correlated with abundance of Formicinae, while only abundance of ant-eating spiders showed positive correlation with abundance of Myrmicinae ants. All genera/species of ant-associated spider were associated with one or more genera/specie of ants. Both spiders and ants have not benefited from the adjacent non-crop habitat. Sheet web weaver spiders were found to be positively correlated with the percentage of ground cover. These results show that a) vineyard agroecosystem support a rich assemblage of ants and spiders evincing that wine production and species conservation is possible and b) non-random co-occurrence between ants and ant-associated spiders exist in the field.","[Goncalves, F.; Carlos, C.; Oliveira, I; Torres, L.] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci, P-5001801 Vila Real, Portugal; [Zina, V] Univ Lisbon, Ctr Estudos Florestais, Lisbon, Portugal; [Carlos, C.] Assoc Dev Viticulture Douro Reg, Vila Real, Portugal; [Crespo, L.] Univ Barcelona, Biodivers Res Inst IRBio, Dept Evolutionary Biol Ecol & Environm Sci Arthrop, Barcelona, Spain","Goncalves, F (corresponding author), Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci, P-5001801 Vila Real, Portugal.",mariafg@utad.pt,"Oliveira, Irene/K-6814-2013; Goncalves, Fatima/AAS-5855-2021","Oliveira, Irene/0000-0002-9065-4336; carlos, cristina/0000-0001-9236-9785; Goncalves, Fatima/0000-0001-7770-4477; Zina, Vera/0000-0002-5202-881X; Torres, Laura/0000-0002-2512-1074","European Investment Funds by FEDER/COMPETE/POCI-Operacional Competitiveness and Internacionalization Programme [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006958]; National funds by FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [UID/AGR/04033/2013]; INTERACT project - Integrated Research in Environment, Agro-Chain and Technology [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000017]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through NORTE 2020 (North Regional Operational Program); FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [Pest-OE/AGR/U10239/2014]","We thank the two wine companies involved on this study.

Cuscuta had a strong host species preference in experiments, disproportionally infecting Salicornia virginica, the dominant competitor in most of the marsh. In plots with Cuscuta, which infected 18% of our study area over a 3-year period, Salicornia cover decreased and the cover of Arthrocnemum increased substantially in comparison to plots without Cuscuta. Deep in the Salicornia zone, the cover of Arthrocnemum in Cuscuta-infected plots increased by 558% in 1 year relative to uninfected plots. At the ecotone, the cover of Arthrocnemum in Cuscuta-infected plots increased by only 41% during the same time interval. These data suggest that the relative benefit of a consumer to a less-preferred, subordinate competitor may be strongest where competition is the most asymmetrical as predicted by recent theoretical models. By weakening the competitive dominant, which in the absence of the parasite can create virtual monocultures, Cuscuta enhanced community diversity and altered the ecotone between Salicornia and Arthrocnemum. Cuscuta patches were highly dynamic at the ecotone between Salicornia and Arthrocnemum, and thus the changes we measured in our sample plots were likely to be representative of large portions of the marsh. Our findings emphasize the importance of trophic interactions in salt marsh structure and zonation.","Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; Univ Georgia, Inst Marine, Sapelo Island, GA 31327 USA","Callaway, RM (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",vmcmail@selway.umt.edu,"Pennings, Steven C/A-8326-2013","Pennings, Steven C/0000-0003-4757-7125",,,,71,54,59,2,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,1998,114,1,,,,,100,105,,10.1007/s004420050425,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZD796,WOS:000072725300013,28307547,,,,2021-09-27,

During 1991, 132 metamorphosed salamanders (35-109 mm SVL) were marked and released; 207 recaptures were made of 87 individuals. Mean home-range area was 1207 cm(2), and mean salamander density was 1.4/m(2). Smaller salamanders (< 70 mm SVL) predominated in the stream, and larger ones occurred more frequently in the stream bed between the water line and the forest. Smaller individuals spent more time wandering whereas adults remained in refugia. Preferred refugia were rock crevices; larger salamanders also commonly used burrows at the bank/water interface and in the dirt banks of the stream bed. Spacing of home-range centers did not differ from random; spacing of individual salamander locations was contagious. In interactive experiments performed in the field in 1994, adults ate juveniles, and juveniles fled from adults. Individuals in refugia reacted aggressively toward intruders regardless of body size differential. Wandering salamanders of similar size were aggressive approximately 50% of the time. Desmognathus quadramaculatus defends a territory of repeatedly used refugia, from which it excludes conspecifics through a probable combination of pheromonal advertisement and aggressive interference, with cannibalism being the ultimate aggressive response. Individuals outside refugia exhibit a series of aggressive and escape behaviors with small salamanders avoiding large ones, as well as their microhabitat. The spacing patterns observed do not fully fit predictions based on current models of spatial interactions of Desmognathus.",,"Camp, CD (corresponding author), PIEDMONT COLL, DEPT BIOL, DEMOREST, GA 30535 USA.",,,,,,,38,27,28,0,8,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,FEB 2,1996,,1,,,,,78,84,,10.2307/1446943,,,7,Zoology,Zoology,TU870,WOS:A1996TU87000008,,,,,2021-09-27,

In this study, we document the short-term effects of three irregular shelterwood cutting patterns on the establishment and composition of regeneration as well as on its use by snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus E.). Specifically, we compared uniform, gap, and strip cutting patterns with soil preparation, relative to uncut controls. We counted seedlings, browse, and hare pellets, and measured habitat characteristics after two growing seasons in micro-plots delimited in each of the shelterwood cutting patterns. The mixture of soil and humus resulting from scarification promoted yellow birch establishment. Yellow birch seedlings in gaps were more abundant than in controls, but their abundance was comparable to other irregular shelterwood patterns. All irregular shelterwood patterns promoted competition mainly by pin cherry (Prunus pensylvanica L.f.), beaked hazel (Cmylus comuta M.), and mountain maple (Acer spicatum Lam.). Snowshoe hare browse on yellow birch was low for all irregular shelterwood patterns. Moose browse pressure was higher than that from hare. We found no short-term impact of the snowshoe hare on yellow birch seedling establishment and survival. Snowshoe hare pellet counts suggested a preference for gaps. This result could be explained by increased food and protective cover from higher seedling and shrub densities in gaps than in other treatments. In the short-term, up to three years post-treatment, irregular shelterwood cutting helps to promote yellow birch regeneration, a semi-tolerant species, while maintaining habitat for snowshoe hare.

Across all the sites, in Norfolk, UK, an inverse relationship occurred between (a) the amounts of chlorophyll-a and of other potential food materials and (b) the degree of coverage by water. The biomass of consumers also decreased with increased water coverage, so that the lagoons supported less biomass than the adjacent high-level intertidal sites. Further, the deposit-feeder biomass supported by unit food decreased with extent of water coverage. There was no evidence of any relationship between deposit-feeder and food biomass within any single site, in spite of the study period being selected to be that in which there was maximum likelihood of competition for microphytobenthic food. Whilst chlorophyll concentrations may set the maximum achievable level of consumer biomass at these sites, including in the deeper lagoons setting very low potential maximum population densities, the seasonal abundance patterns of the deposit feeders appear to be determined by other factor(s).","Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; Univ Western Cape, Dept Zool, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa","Barnes, RSK (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.",rsb1001@cam.ac.uk,,"Barnes, Richard/0000-0002-5773-5994",,,,68,23,24,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0025-3154,1469-7769,,J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK,J.

Small, post-dieoff sheep herds are often unable to fully recover to pre-dieoff densities, and researchers have identified several factors limiting such populations including disease, predation, competition, climate, nutritional deficiencies, and loss of genetic variability. We studied a small bighorn sheep herd in west central Montana from 1995 to 1997 to identify the mechanisms responsible for poor population performance subsequent to a dieoff in 1984. In contrast to the migratory pre-dieoff population, the current sedentary population was restricted to a small area of low elevation range throughout the year. Whereas we observed limited annual adult mortality due to disease and predation, ewe productivity and lamb recruitment rates were low in all years. Lamb production and survival were highly correlated with summer climatic conditions, with the highest rate of disease-mediated lamb mortality occurring during a summer drought and the lowest rate of ewe productivity occurring subsequent to this drought. Our data suggest that disease continues to play a significant role this bighorn sheep population, and nutritional quality of summer forage influenced not only sheep immunocompetence and susceptibility to disease but also herd productivity. Winter is generally considered the critical season for ungulate populations in the northern Rocky Mountains, yet summer climatic conditions can have important implications for performance of sedentary, low elevation sheep populations. We suggest that an understanding of population-specific limiting factors is essential to successful management of post-dieoff bighorn sheep herds. Data obtained through rigorous field studies facilitate the development and implementation of efficient, biologically sound strategies to improve performance of these populations.","Montana State Univ, Dept Biol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Enk, TA (corresponding author), 22 Herrada Rd, Santa Fe, NM 87505 USA.",,,,,,,76,22,22,3,19,WASHINGTON STATE UNIV,PULLMAN,"PO BOX 645020, PULLMAN, WA 99164-5910 USA",0029-344X,,,NORTHWEST SCI,Northwest Sci.,SUM,2001,75,3,,,,,280,291,,,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,462UU,WOS:000170438800010,,,,,2021-09-27,

Here we compared some of the short-term ecological implications of chemical and physical removal of the bush encroacher Acacia mellifera in the central Highland savanna of Namibia. We selected 21 invaded sites, 7 had been chemically cleared, 7 had been physically cleared and 7 had never been cleared. From each site, we recorded grass species composition, as well as the densities of A.. mellifera, the undesired perennial shrub Pechuel-loeschea leubnitziae and a non-targeted tree Acacia erioloba, 24-30 months post-treatment. We fitted one-way ANOVA models to test for the effect of treatment on grass species richness and density of targeted and non-targeted tree species. A canonical correspondence analysis was used to determine how treatment affected grass species composition. While both treatments reduced the density of the bush encroacher, P. leubnitziae effectively replaced A. mellifera in chemically treated sites, where die-back presumably happened faster and nutrient and water competition decreased more rapidly. In such sites, perennial grass species were effectively outcompeted by P. leubnitiziae. (C) 2015 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved.","[Haussmann, N.

Theory and limited experimental work in this area suggest that an initial ''pioneer'' colonist arriving in open habitat can strongly influence this process, resulting in a priority effect. We used a ubiquitous terrestrial animal group, spiders, to test for the existence of priority effects during colonization of individual sagebrush shrubs. In 1992, at a site in northern Utah, we applied three treatments to subsets of 60 cleared shrubs that represented available habitat to spiders. Two shrub treatments received different jumping spider pioneer colonists placed by hand (either Metaphidippus aeneolus (Curtis 1892) or Phidippus johnsoni (Peckham & Peckham 1883)), and a third shrub treatment received no placed spiders, serving as a reference. After 3-4 days of exposure to the same environmental conditions, including natural colonization by dispersing spiders, we collected a total of 285 spider assemblages that had developed on shrubs. We compared these assemblages by treatment type at both the species and guild levels, defining spider guilds based on differences in morphology and foraging technique (e.g., jumpers, trappers, ambushers, and pursuers). The total number of spiders per shrub was not significantly different by treatment type (P = 0.279), and overall measures of species richness and abundance were similar. At the guild level of analysis, however, differences were observed. Total counts of trappers were 43-50% lower in treatments receiving a placed jumper pioneer. A log-linear model comparing treatments as a whole confirmed that jumper pioneers significantly reduced trapper numbers in subsequent assemblages compared to those from reference shrubs (P = 0.019), and significantly fewer trappers were collected from shrubs that had Metaphidippus aeneolus as a pioneer (P = 0.034). This evidence of short-term priority effects was found despite a conservative aspect of our test, in which the reference shrubs had some likelihood (35%) of receiving either of these jumper pioneers by chance from natural dispersal. It is not known whether these priority effects persist over longer time scales. The observed results are consistent with predictions based on known spider behaviors of cannibalism and interguild predation. Outcomes of these spider-spider interactions relate to differences in foraging technique and body size. We suggest that a guild-level approach and the shrub-spider system we describe have promise for future research on priority effects and animal community assembly.","UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA",,,,,,,,123,22,22,0,30,AMER ARACHNOLOGICAL SOC,COLLEGE PARK,"UNIV MARYLAND, DEPT ENTOMOLOGY, 4112 PLANT SCIENCES BLDG, COLLEGE PARK, MD 20742-4454 USA",0161-8202,,,J ARACHNOL,J.

The investigation deals with a set of three distinct species that evolve according to the standard rules of mobility, reproduction and predation, with predation following the cyclic rules of the popular rock, paper and scissors game. The study uncovers the possibility to distinguish between time evolutions that start from slightly different initial states, guided by the Hamming distance which heuristically unveils the chaotic behavior. The finding opens up a quantitative approach that relates the correlation length to the average density of maxima of a typical species, and an ensemble of stochastic simulations is implemented to support the procedure. The main result of the work shows how a single and simple experimental realization that counts the density of maxima associated with the chaotic evolution of the species serves to infer its correlation length. We use the result to investigate others distinct complex systems, one dealing with a set of differential equations that can be used to model a diversity of natural and artificial chaotic systems, and another one, focusing on the ocean water level.","[Bazeia, D.; Ramos, J.

Winter flounder (WF) and summer flounder (SF) abundance and growth were measured from May to October (2009-2013) and served as indicators for the use and quality of shallow-water habitats (water depth < 1.5-3.0 m). These bioindicators were then analyzed with respect to physiochemical conditions to determine the mechanisms underlying intraspecific habitat selection. WF and SF abundances were greatest in late May and June (maximum monthly mean = 4.9 and 0.55 flounder/m(2) for WF and SF, respectively) and were significantly higher in the tidal rivers relative to the bay and lagoons. Habitat-related patterns in WF and SF abundance were primarily governed by their preferences for oligohaline (0.1-5 ppt) and mesohaline (6-18 ppt) waters, but also their respective avoidance of hypoxic conditions (< 4 mg DO/L) and warm water temperatures (> 25 A degrees C). Flounder habitat usage was also positively related to sediment organic content, which may be due to these substrates having sufficiently high prey densities. WF growth rates (mean = 0.25 +/- 0.14 mm/day) were negatively correlated with the abundance of conspecifics, whereas SF growth (mean = 1.39 +/- 0.46 mm/day) was positively related to temperature and salinity. Also, contrary to expectations, flounder occupied habitats that offered no ostensible advantage in intraspecific growth rates. WF and SF exposed to low salinities in certain rivers likely experienced increased osmoregulatory costs, thereby reducing energy for somatic growth. Low-salinity habitats, however, may benefit flounder by providing refugia from predation or reduced competition with other estuarine fishes and macroinvertebrates. Examining WF and SF abundance and growth across each species' broader geographic distribution revealed that southern New England habitats may constitute functionally significant nurseries. These results also indicated that juvenile SF have a geographic range extending further north than previously recognized.","[Taylor, David L.; Gervasi, Carissa L.; Palance, Danial G.] Roger Williams Univ, Dept Marine Biol, 1 Old Ferry Rd, Bristol, RI 02809 USA; [McNamee, Jason; Lake, John] Ft Wetherill Marine Lab, Marine Fisheries, Div Fish & Wildlife, 3 Ft Wetherill Dr, Jamestown, RI 02835 USA","Taylor, DL (corresponding author), Roger Williams Univ, Dept Marine Biol, 1 Old Ferry Rd, Bristol, RI 02809 USA.",dtaylor@rwu.edu,,"McNamee, Jason/0000-0002-1442-4432; Gervasi, Carissa/0000-0003-1590-9332",Rhode Island (RI) National Science Foundation Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research; RI Science and Technology Advisory Council Research Alliance Collaborative Grant; RWU Foundation Fund Based Research Grant; National Center for Research ResourcesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [P20RR016457]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [P20RR016457] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P20GM103430] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Office Of The DirectorNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [1004057] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We are grateful to B.

E aquilonia is highly dependent on canopy-dwelling aphids, thus the removal of trees should cause food limitation. During the course of the 4-year experiment, 9 of the forests were partially clear-cut.

Competition can influence patterns of distribution, abundance, and resource use in many systems but remains difficult to measure. We quantified competition between two sympatric small mammals, Keen's mice (Peromyscus keen) and dusky shrews (Sorex monticolus), in four habitat types on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska. We related shrew density to that of mice using standardized regression models while accounting for habitat variables in each year from 2010-2012, during which mice populations peaked (2011) and then crashed (2012). Additionally, we measured dietary overlap and segregation using stable isotope analysis and kernel utilization densities and estimated the change in whole community energy consumption among years. We observed an increase in densities of dusky shrews after mice populations crashed in 2012 as expected under competitive release. In addition, competition coefficients revealed that the influence of Keen's mice was dependent on their density. Also in 2012, shrew diets shifted, indicating that they were able to exploit resources previously used by mice. Nonetheless, increases in shrew numbers only partially compensated for the community energy consumption because, as insectivores, they are unlikely to utilize all food types consumed by their competitors. In pre-commercially thinned stands, which exhibit higher diversity of resources compared to other habitat types, shrew populations were less affected by changes in mice densities. These spatially and temporally variable interactions between unlikely competitors, observed in a relatively simple, high-latitude island ecosystem, highlight the difficulty in assessing the role of biotic factors in structuring communities.","[Eckrich, Carolyn A.] Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, La Grande, OR 97850 USA; [Flaherty, Elizabeth A.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Ben-David, Merav] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Ben-David, Merav] Univ Wyoming, Program Ecol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Eckrich, CA (corresponding author), Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, La Grande, OR 97850 USA.",eckrich.caro@gmail.com,"Flaherty, Elizabeth A/F-1825-2017","Flaherty, Elizabeth A/0000-0001-6872-7984",USDA Forest Service Tongass National Forest [10JV-11100500-021]; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; UW Biodiversity Institute; Department of Zoology and Physiology,"Funding for the project was provided by the USDA Forest Service Tongass National Forest under cooperative agreement 10JV-11100500-021 (http://www.fs.usda.gov/tongass/), the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the UW Biodiversity Institute and Department of Zoology and Physiology.

Given the sexual function of such traits, studies generally focus on individual interactions (i.e., displays and contests) in explaining trait origin and persistence. We show that ecological factors can strongly influence the adaptive value of these traits, and changes to these factors can lead to rapid evolutionary change. We compared sexually selected traits in the small Indian mongoose (Urva auropunctata) between their sparsely populated native range and four tropical islands to which they were introduced within the last 150 years and where, due to a lack of interspecific competition and predation, they have become invasive and densely populated. Because of a likely increase in encounter rate, we predicted that selection on long-distance chemical advertisement by males would relax in the introduced range. Accordingly, male, but not female, anal pads (used in scent marking) decreased in size in relation to both time since introduction and population density, and their relationship to body size and condition weakened. Concurrently, as predicted by intensified sperm competition, testis size increased following introduction. The small Indian mongoose thus experienced an inversion in the relative contributions to fitness of two sexual traits, followed by their rapid evolution in line with ecological changes.","[Owen, M.

However, because defence behaviour is likely to be costly in terms of time and energy, an alternative possibility is that decreases in the nonbreeding season are a consequence of reduced food availability. We studied territoriality in the pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor, a cooperatively breeding bird species that defends permanent territories. Groups interacted with rivals less and responded less strongly to an experimentally simulated intrusion of neighbours in nonbreeding periods compared to the breeding season. Foraging efficiency and biomass intake were significantly lower in the nonbreeding season, which resulted in birds being significantly lighter at this time of year. Finally, a feeding experiment in the nonbreeding season showed that groups given supplementary food significantly increased their response to a simulated territorial intrusion. These results indicate that the reduction in territorial behaviour during the nonbreeding season may be attributed, at least in part, to a reduction in food availability. We suggest that future studies on seasonal variation in territorial behaviour, especially those investigating species in which two or more individuals combine their defence, should take this potential constraint into account. 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The few studies adopting a broader view have revealed that these plants mediate a series of direct and indirect competitive and facilitative effects on community structure and ecosystem processes. I summarize findings from the two best-studied systems: a set of experimental and manipulative studies from northern Sweden and an integrated research programme in southern Australia, both focusing on the most abundant hemiparasite in the region -Bartsia alpina (Orobanchaceae; Lamiales) and Amyema miquelii (Loranthaceae; Santalales), respectively. Despite broad-based differences between these regions, their vegetation types and biotic constituents, rates of litter-fall, litter decomposition, nutrient return and plant growth all increased near the hemiparasites in both cases. This leads to changes in the abundance of other plants and the increased species richness and total biomass reflects an indirect form of facilitation. In addition to reallocation of nutrients from host tissues, some of the additional nutrients may be excreted by other organisms, such as visiting pollinators, seed dispersers, herbivores and members of below-ground decomposer communities. Small-scale heterogeneity in nutrient availability could provide a mechanistic process underlying the role of parasitic plants as keystone resources. Parasitic plants can be regarded as either malevolent predators (Dracula) or charitable benefactors(Robin Hood), but may be better described as Dryads (Greek deities associated with specific trees, which, in addition to being reliant on their host for their wellbeing, affect nearby trees and visiting animals, rendering the surrounding stand a sacred grove). Synthesis. The Dryad role may be applicable to a wide range of facilitators, whereby indirect interactions with other organisms affect both hosts and adjacent plants, augmenting direct plant-plant interactions. However, while consistent with both case studies and information from studies of other parasitic plants, this role may be most apparent in low productivity systems. Addition, removal and animal exclosure experiments are highlighted as useful approaches to quantify the community-level influence of parasitic plants, in addition to dedicated work on the below-ground influences of parasitic plants.","Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia","Watson, DM (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia.",dwatson@csu.edu.au,,"David, Watson/0000-0003-1821-4632","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0342549, DP0449417]","This article is based on an invited presentation for the Facilitation in Plant Communities Symposium, held by the British Ecological Society in Aberdeen, Scotland 20-22 April 2009.

Identifying contrived features of mesocosms that affect endpoints of interest is a prudent step in ensuring the reliability of mesocosm data. Because anuran larvae actively regulate their exposure to a suite of biotic and abiotic conditions by positioning themselves at various depths in natural ponds, the steep walls and minimal access to shallow regions in common cattle tank mesocosms may force tadpoles into sub-optimal patterns of habitat use. We tested whether adding angled ramps or horizontal platforms to increase access to shallow regions affected survival, time, or mass at metamorphosis of American Toads (Anaxyrus americanus) or Northern Leopard Frogs (Lithobates pipiens) in the presence or absence of Rusty Crayfish (Orconectes rusticus), a common predator that may influence habitat use. Addition of structure had no effect on American Toad survival or metamorphosis, but slightly increased time to metamorphosis and mass at metamorphosis for Northern Leopard Frogs. Behavioral assays revealed that while structure addition increased the number of tadpoles in shallow regions for both species, these increases were small. Most tadpoles were observed on a shallow, built-in lip present on the walls of all of our mesocosms, which are a common feature of most available mesocosms. Post-hoc choice tests revealed that American Toads preferred the lip to both structure types and Northern Leopard Frogs displayed a preference for platforms but no preference when choosing between ramps and the lip. Furthermore, while Rusty Crayfish reduced survival for toads and altered metamorphic responses for both species, they did not alter tadpoles' use of structure. Although access to shallow water may be important for anuran larvae, our study suggests that it may not be necessary to augment shallow water access in cattle tank mesocosms if a shallow lip is already present.","[Hoskins, Tyler D.; Boone, Michelle D.] Miami Univ, Dept Biol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Hoskins, TD (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Biol, 212 Pearson Hall, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",hoskintd@miamiOH.edu; boonemd@miamiOH.edu,,,Miami University; Sigma Xi,"We are grateful to R.

Non-native trout have been stocked in streams and lakes worldwide largely without knowledge of the consequences for native ecosystems. Although trout have been introduced widely throughout the Sierra Nevada of California, U.S.A., fishless streams and their communities of native invertebrates persist in some high elevation areas, providing an opportunity to study the effects of trout introductions on natural fishless stream communities. 2. We compared algal biomass and cover, organic matter levels and invertebrate assemblages in 21 natural fishless headwater streams with 21 paired nearby streams containing stocked trout in Yosemite National Park. 3. Although environmental conditions and particulate organic matter levels did not differ between the fishless and trout streams, algal biomass (as chlorophyll a concentration) and macroalgal cover were, on average, approximately two times and five times higher, respectively, in streams containing trout. 4. There were no differences in the overall densities of invertebrates in fishless versus paired trout streams; however, invertebrate richness (after rarefaction), evenness, and Simpson and Shannon diversities were 10-20% higher in fishless than in trout streams. 5. The densities of invertebrates belonging to the scraper-algivore and predator functional feeding guilds were higher, and those for the collector-gatherer guild lower, in fishless than trout streams, but there was considerable variation in the effects of trout on specific taxa within functional feeding groups. 6. We found that the densities of 10 of 50 common native invertebrate taxa (found in more than half of the stream pairs) were reduced in trout compared to fishless streams. A similar number of rarer taxa also were absent or less abundant in the presence of trout. Many of the taxa that declined with trout were conspicuous forms (by size and behaviour) whose native habitats are primarily high elevation montane streams above the original range of trout. 7. Only a few taxa increased in the presence of trout, possibly benefiting from reductions in their competitors and predators by trout predation. 8. These field studies provide catchment-scale evidence showing the selective influence of introduced trout on stream invertebrate and algal communities. Removal of trout from targeted headwater streams may promote the recovery of native taxa, community structure and trophic organisation.","[Herbst, David B.] Univ Calif, Sierra Nevada Aquat Res Lab, Mammoth Lakes, CA 93546 USA; [Silldorff, Erik L.; Cooper, Scott D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Silldorff, Erik L.; Cooper, Scott D.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Herbst, DB (corresponding author), Univ Calif, Sierra Nevada Aquat Res Lab, HCR 79,Box 198, Mammoth Lakes, CA 93546 USA.",herbst@lifesci.ucsb.edu,,"Herbst, David/0000-0002-7879-5902","Nature Conservancy, Ecosystem Research Program [HO-CSD-050600-CA]; University of California Water Resources CenterUniversity of California System [W-930]","We are grateful to The Nature Conservancy, Ecosystem Research Program (Grant Award no.

The relationship between epifaunal biomass and the biomass of algal types was examined. The study was carried out at three sites with marked differences in the abundance of predatory fishes. Changes in epifaunal abundance were linked to changes in the annual standing crop of fleshy erect algae, which exhibited pronounced seasonal variation. However, there were few significant differences in epifaunal abundance levels between sites and, when present, only for short periods. Experimental manipulations of predation intensity (exclusion cages) were employed to examine the effect of fishes on epifaunal abundance. Experimental treatments altered epifaunal abundance: although in some cases epifauna decreased within exclusion cages relative to unmanipulated controls, most epifaunal groups responded to caging by increased abundance. These contradictory results do not allow determination of the role of predation by fishes in regulating the abundance of the epifauna, but they suggest that untested complex interactions (mainly related to algae structure and dynamics) may be responsible for these patterns.

Although drilling frequencies howed fluctuating patterns, most of the previous studies argued that naticid drilling predation was less intense during the Cretaceous and the modern values were achieved since the Paleocene. We, here, present a new dataset of naticid drilling predations, involving 31,929 gastropod specimens, from the latest Maastrichtian Infratrappean bed in Rajahmundry, southern India. These specimens belonged to 40 species of 20 families, thus representing a spectacular gastropod diversity that was not known until recently from this region. We examined 5884 complete or near complete specimens to quantify naticid drilling predation on this assemblage. It appeared that drilling frequency was significantly higher from all previous Cretaceous values. This was true for both assemblage-level and lower taxon-level results. Along with high successful drilling and low unsuccessful drilling frequencies, site and size stereotypy of drillholes suggest that naticid predators were highly efficient, even in the Cretaceous. Predators were prey selective and there was poor correlation between relative abundance and drilling frequency of prey taxa. The present Maastrichtian assemblage underlies the K-T mass extinction level. Drilling frequency was zero in the straddler prey community in the Intertrappean bed found immediately above the K-T boundary. The absence of any drillhole in surviving prey taxa may be due to sudden reduction in abundance of escalated predators, although some prey taxa e.g., cerithiids continued. This emphasizes the role of mass extinction in disrupting predator-prey interaction. We conclude that naticid drilling-induced escalation was already established during the Cretaceous and the present find extends the paleobiogeography of naticid predation (which was previously reported from the western world) up to India.

Although the basic causes are clearing, fragmentation and degradation of these woodlands, several ecological processes are involved. These include: difficulties in dispersing among remnants, interspecific competition, increased nest predation, and decline in key resources, including food. Many bird species declined during the recent long drought in south-eastern Australia. Research over the last decade has strongly emphasised effects at the landscape level. It is now clear that more native vegetation in the landscape leads to more bird species. There is stronger evidence that aggressive and nest-predatory birds contribute to the decline of many woodland birds. Several studies have linked the presence of individual bird species to key habitat features, such as high or low density of trees, shrubs and coarse woody debris. The main priorities for the conservation of woodland birds to reverse these declines are: (1) detailed studies on the population dynamics of a variety of declining woodland birds under different management regimes; (2) experiments that closely monitor the response of woodland birds to manipulation of competitors, predators and habitat features; and (3) broad-scale implementation of management based on science to aim to reverse the fortunes of woodland birds on regional and national scales.","Univ New England, Zool & Res Ctr Behav & Physiol Ecol, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia","Ford, HA (corresponding author), Univ New England, Zool & Res Ctr Behav & Physiol Ecol, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",hford@une.edu.au,,,,,,92,70,89,0,45,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",0158-4197,1448-5540,,EMU,Emu,,2011,111,1,,,,,1,9,,10.1071/MU09115,,,9,Ornithology,Zoology,723TI,WOS:000287529500002,,,,,2021-09-27,

Recent studies of Pleistocene predators revealed high numbers of teeth broken in life, suggesting that carcass utilization and, consequently, food competition was more intense in the past than at present. However, the putative association between diet and tooth fracture frequency was based on a small sample of large, highly carnivorous species. In the present study, a greater diversity of extant carnivorans is sampled, including insectivorous, omnivorous, and carnivorous forms, ranging in size from weasels to tigers. Species that habitually consume hard foods (bones, shells) had the highest fracture frequencies, followed by carnivores, and then insectivorous and/or omnivorous species. Predator and prey sizes were not associated with tooth fracture frequency, but more aggressive species did break their teeth more often. Comparison of the modern sample with five Pleistocene species confirms the previous finding of higher tooth breakage in the past, although some extant species have fracture frequencies that approach those of extinct species. Thus, the Pleistocene predator guild appears to have been characterized by relatively high levels of competition that are rarely observed today.

By manipulating the density of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, while keeping the sex ratio constant, I found that male mating tactics were phenotypically plastic with respect to density. As density increased, males decreased their courtship displays. Male-male competition and mate searching were highest at intermediate densities. Population density had no significant effect on the total number of copulations, copulatory tactics or the percentage of postcopulatory guarding. Female preference for males with a higher percentage of orange coloration was similar at all density levels. The 'opportunity for sexual selection', which estimates the upper limit to which a selected trait can shift if directional selection is operating and was calculated as the variance in number of copulations per male divided by the square of the mean number of copulations, was negatively associated with population density. This may be due to the decrease in male-male competition at high density rather than female preference which was similar across density treatments.

To determine the importance of cotyledons in the growth and development of seedlings, we simulated two levels of predation [light (30 % cotyledon loss) and heavy (60 % loss) partial consumption] and two soil nutrient contents (nutrient-poor soil, nutrient-rich soil). Seedlings height, root length, dry root and shoot biomass, specific leaf mass, leaf density, gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and photosynthetic pigment concentrations were determined. Results indicated that effect of nutrient level on the growth of the oak seedlings was more important than that of cotyledon biomass. However, in nutrient-poor soils, cotyledon biomass played a major role in the early performance of cork oaks. Acorns grown in nutrient-rich substrate, despite having greater aerial vigor, were slower to develop a vertical root, and hence less likely to reach permanent moisture. Cotyledon loss caused a decrease in the biomass of roots and shoots when acorns were heavily consumed, and as a result experienced a reduction in net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and chlorophyll concentration. Survival of seedlings was unaffected by either soil type or cotyledon loss. Our results show that effects of soil type on the survival of oak seedlings were more important than those of cotyledon biomass. However, in a competitive situation, cotyledon biomass, as an indicative of growth nutrient support rather than an energy source, could be vital in a nutrient-poor environment, particularly in Mediterranean climate regions and for species with little inherent drought tolerance (as is the case of Quercus spp.), where rapid root growth is required to ensure that contact with soil moisture is maintained over the first summer.","[Manuel Mancilla-Leyton, Juan; Cambrolle, Jesus; Enrique Figueroa, Manuel; Martin Vicente, Angel] Univ Seville, Dept Biol Vegetal & Ecol, E-41080 Seville, Spain","Mancilla-Leyton, J (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Dept Biol Vegetal & Ecol, Apdo 1095, E-41080 Seville, Spain.",jmancilla@us.es; cambrolle@us.es; figueroa@us.es; angelm@us.es,"Figueroa Clemente, Manuel Enrique/L-7577-2014; Cambrolle, Jesus/G-7133-2012; Mancilla Leyton, Juan Manuel/L-7172-2014","Figueroa Clemente, Manuel Enrique/0000-0002-8806-4054; Cambrolle, Jesus/0000-0002-9750-6328; Mancilla Leyton, Juan Manuel/0000-0002-9042-6683",University of Seville (IV Plan Propio de Investigacion) [5/2012],"Our special thanks go to the managers of Donana National Park and Dehesa de Gatos S.

We compared the dynamics of natural and experimentally constructed mussel patches (Mytilus trossulus and M. edulis) in two intertidal habitats, tidepools and emergent rock, over a time series (5, 10, 15 mo) and among seasons (three successive 5-mo intervals). In tidepools, mussels naturally occurred in small patches (median < 25 cm(2)). In contrast, mussels on emergent rock formed extensive beds with decimeter-scale gaps., but these beds start as small patches following disturbance such as ice scour. For our experimental patches (15 cm(2)) in both habitats, we assessed the relative importance of physical (wave disturbance) and biological (predation, growth, recruitment, and immigration) processes in determining patch size and structure. Although individual experimental and natural patches varied greatly in size over time, mean patch area remained relatively constant. In general, mean size of individuals in experimental patches decreased due to the loss of larger mussels while numbers increased due to recruitment. Wave disturbance, which removes and redistributes mussels, appeared to be more important than predation (by the whelk Nucella lapillus) in determining patch structure and dynamics on this shore, although losses due to either process did not differ consistently between habitats over time. Individual growth rates were low (shell length less than or equal to0.4 mm/mo) but greater in tidepools than on emergent rock, whereas recruitment and immigration rates generally did not differ between habitats. Although each process contributed to changes in patch size and structure, collectively they did not result in a marked divergence in mean patch area or biomass between tidepools and emergent rock over the 15-mo experiment. We suggest that the broad patterns of distribution and abundance of mussels develop slowly on this shore largely because of low individual growth rates. Over time scales of years, however, positive relationships between individual growth and recruitment rates and patch size may accelerate the expansion of aggregations on emergent rock. Mussel assemblages at our site differ from those examined in many other studies in terms of the relative importance of wave dislodgment and predation as causes of loss and in the role of growth in offsetting these losses, This study shows how integrative approaches, with monitoring of patches and individuals within patches, can provide detailed mechanistic understanding of patch structure and dynamics.","Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada","Hunt, HL (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, 71 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833",,,,69,67,68,0,46,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2001,82,11,,,,,3213,3231,,10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[3213:PDOMOR]2.0.CO;2,,,19,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,491ZB,WOS:000172139500018,,,,,2021-09-27,

Unfortunately, this information is scarce for elusive species such as the threatened European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris), especially in Mediterranean areas. Using radio-tracking and camera-trapping, we studied the habitat selection and the diel activity of a wildcat population in SE Spain, with particular emphasis on the relationships between wildcats and their main prey, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). First, we used Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) to analyse the influence of vegetation, rabbit abundance, topography and humanization on wildcat presence at several spatial scales and according to wildcat activity. Second, we used Spearman's rank correlations to assess the spatial relationship between the relative abundance indexes (RAIs) of wildcats and rabbits. Third, we used kernel density estimates to determine the daily activity patterns of wildcats and rabbits, and compared them by calculating the coefficient of overlap Delta. Patch complexity, rabbit abundance, slope and cover of dense scrubs were the most influential variables on wildcat presence. However, the effects of some environmental variables were scale-dependent. The relationship between rabbit abundance and wildcat presence was positive for the smaller scales and, unexpectedly, negative for the largest one. This result was supported by the quadratic relationship between wildcat RAI and rabbit RAI, indicating that wildcats generally avoided the highest rabbit abundance areas. We observed a typical nocturnal activity for wildcats, which surprisingly did not synchronize with the rabbit activity patterns. Rabbit antipredatory strategies, human pressure avoidance behaviour in wildcats and competition with other carnivores could be behind the observed spatiotemporal mismatch between wildcats and rabbits. Overall, our study highlights the importance of combining spatial and temporal approaches to obtain an integrative view of how resources are exploited by wildlife.

Predation is the predominant trophic interaction generally considered to be responsible for ecological change after invasion. In contrast, how frequently competition from invasive species contributes to the decline of native species remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate how the trophic ecology of the remote atoll nation of Tokelau is changing due to competition between invasive ants (Anoplolepis gracilipes) and native terrestrial hermit crabs (Coenobita spp.) for carrion. A significant negative correlation was observed between A. gracilipes and hermit crab abundance. On islands with A. gracilipes, crabs were generally restricted to the periphery of invaded islands. Very few hermit crabs were found in central areas of these islands where A. gracilipes abundances were highest. Ant exclusion experiments demonstrated that changes in the abundance and distribution of hermit crabs on Tokelau are a result of competition. The ants did not kill the hermit crabs. Rather, when highly abundant, A. gracilipes attacked crabs by spraying acid and drove crabs away from carrion resources. Analysis of naturally occurring N and C isotopes suggests that the ants are effectively lowering the trophic level of crabs. According to delta(15) N values, hermit crabs have a relatively high trophic level on islands where A. gracilipes have not invaded. In contrast, where these ants have invaded we observed a significant decrease in delta(15) N for all crab species. This result concurs with our experiment in suggesting long-term exclusion from carrion resources, driving co-occurring crabs towards a more herbivorous diet. Changes in hermit crab abundance or distribution may have major ramifications for the stability of plant communities. Because A. gracilipes have invaded many tropical islands where the predominant scavengers are hermit crabs, we consider that their competitive effects are likely to be more prominent in structuring communities than predation.","[McNatty, Alice; Lester, Philip J.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Abbott, Kirsti L.] Monash Univ, Fac Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia","Lester, PJ (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",Phil.Lester@vuw.ac.nz,"Lester, Phil/A-1296-2008","Lester, Phil/0000-0002-1801-5687",Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden FundRoyal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ); Pacific Conservation and Development Trust; Victoria University of Wellington,"We would like to thank the Pulenuku and Taupulega of Nukunonu Atoll, Tokelau, for permission to conduct this study and for support during Weldwork.

During summer 2003, 14 Canadian Shield lakes were sampled biweekly to evaluate the effect of Bythotrephes on epilimnetic rotifers. Rotifer densities, particularly those of Conochilus unicornis, significantly increased, with elevated Bythotrephes densities. Conochilus became the dominant rotifer species in the pelagic community of lakes with high B. longimanus populations. Bythotrephes densities were a better estimator of rotifer densities than physical and chemical lake properties. Bythotrephes has indirect effects beyond its preferred prey species, cladocerans. The potential for increased rotifer densities to act as a secondary source of food for Bythotrephes was also investigated. In a 24-h feeding experiment, Bythotrephes did not prey on various common rotifer species, suggesting that Bythotrephes ignores rotifer species as a prey even when they form the sole food source. Rotifer increases are likely either due to competitive release when crustacean zooplankton decline or predatory release when native invertebrate predator populations decline.","Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Sci, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Beisner, BE (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Sci, Case Postale 8888,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",beisner.beatrix@uqam.ca,"Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020","Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887",,,,41,20,21,0,8,AMER SOC LIMNOLOGY OCEANOGRAPHY,WACO,"5400 BOSQUE BLVD, STE 680, WACO, TX 76710-4446 USA",0024-3590,,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR,Limnol.

High B. constrictor densities could stress prey populations on this small, faunally simplistic island. We examined diet, size, and condition of 501 B. constrictor at three periods over nearly 15 y: during early invasion, approaching the peak in encounters, and after 5 y of declining encounters. The 401 prey identified consisted of 32.9% mammals, 37.4% lizards, and 29.7% birds. Dietary proportion of these categories was consistent across sampling periods. Non-native prey were consumed in relatively high proportions. Despite a positive relationship between snake snout-vent length and prey mass, even the largest snakes consumed small prey. During the high encounter period, many snakes had empty digestive tracts, little abdominal fat, and low body mass, possibly due to a decline in prey availability; however, snakes from residential/agricultural areas had better body condition than those from natural areas. High population densities of the native Aruban Whiptail Lizard (Cnemidophorus arubensis) may provide a consistent food supply for B. constrictor in both natural and residential/agricultural areas, and domesticated prey near human habitation may subsidize the population in residential/agricultural areas. Improved body condition in the last sampling period suggests that the population is either stabilizing or poised for an increase.

Based on theoretical assumptions and field observations, we tested experimentally the hypothesis that mixotrophs may invade established plankton communities depending on the trophic status of the system, and investigated possible effects on food web structure, species diversity, and nutrient dynamics. To test our hypothesis, we inoculated the mixotrophic nanoflagellate Ochromonas tuberculata into established planktonic food webs, consisting of specialist phototrophs, specialist phagotrophs, and bacteria at different supplies of soluble inorganic nutrients and dissolved organic carbon. Oligotrophic systems facilitated the invasion of O. tuberculata in two different ways. First, the combination of photosynthesis and phagotrophy gave mixotrophs a competitive advantage over specialist phototrophs and specialist phagotrophs. Second, low nutrient supplies supported the growth of small plankton organisms that fell into the food size spectrum of mixotrophs. Conversely, high nutrient supplies prevented O. tuberculata from successfully invading the food webs. Two important conclusions were derived from our experiments. First, in contrast to a paradigm of ecology, specialization may not necessarily be the most successful strategy for survival under stable conditions. Indeed, the use of several resources with lower efficiency can be an equally, or even more, successful strategy in nature. Second, when limiting nutrients promote the growth of bacterio- and picophytoplankton, invading mixotrophs may have a habitat-ameliorating effect for higher trophic levels, gauged in terms of food quantity and quality. Using given resources more efficiently, O. tuberculata generated higher biomasses and expressed an increased nutritional value for potential planktivores, due to decreased cellular carbon to phosphorus (C:P) ratios compared to specialized plankton taxa. Our findings may help to explain why energy transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and higher trophic levels is generally higher in oligotrophic systems than in nutrient rich environments.","Univ Munich, Dept Biol Aquat Ecol 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany","Katechakis, A (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Dept Biol Aquat Ecol 2, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.",alexis.katechakis@gmx.net,,,,,,59,26,26,2,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2006,148,4,,,,,692,701,,10.1007/s00442-006-0413-4,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,056OG,WOS:000238533400016,16568278,,,,2021-09-27,

Laboratory studies indicating increased prey capture by fish when predatory invertebrates are present suggested a field experiment to evaluate the effect of stonefly removal on growth rare of fish. Individually marked juvenile cutthroat trout (Oncorynchus clarki) were introduced into replicate experimental stream channels beside a coastal Pacific rainforest stream. In stream channels with large perlid stoneflies (Doroneuria and Calineuria sp.) trout gained mass, whereas in channels without stoneflies trout lost body mass. There was no significant effect of stoneflies on trout mortality over the month-long experiments. Although total predator number and biomass were higher in channels with stoneflies (trout and stonefly biomass combined), trout apparently gained more from the way prey behavior was altered by the presence of stoneflies, than they lost from any effects of competition far common prey resources. The presence of significant facilitation amongst predators complicates our view of trophic structuring in stream communities, requiring that such nun-intuitive interactions be more explicitly considered both by modelers and experimentalists seeking to evaluate the role of predators in these and in other communities.","UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA,DEPT FOREST SCI,VANCOUVER,BC V6T 1Z4,CANADA; BC ENVIRONM,VANCOUVER,BC V6T 1Z4,CANADA","Soluk, DA (corresponding author), ILLINOIS NAT HIST SURVEY,CTR AQUAT ECOL,607 E PEABODY DR,CHAMPAIGN,IL 61820, USA.",,"Richardson, John/G-1513-2012; Soluk, Daniel A/F-1797-2011","Richardson, John/0000-0001-8135-7447; ",,,,45,35,36,0,19,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,1997,80,2,,,,,214,219,,10.2307/3546588,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YA318,WOS:A1997YA31800002,,,,,2021-09-27,

In aquatic ecosystems, new evidence from microcosm experiments suggests that submerged macrophytes can buffer cladocerans from pulse exposures to the widely used insecticide malathion, and that mitigation increases with macrophyte density. However, whether these results scale up to more complex aquatic communities where ecological interactions such as competition can alter toxicity is unknown. Further, macrophyte abilities to mitigate different insecticide exposure scenarios (i.e. single versus repeated pulses) have never been tested. To address these gaps, we performed a factorial mesocosm experiment examining the influence of four macrophyte treatments (0, 10, 50, or 100 Elodea Canadensis shoots planted per mesocosm) crossed with three malathion exposure scenarios (no insecticide, single pulse, repeated pulses) on aquatic communities containing zooplankton, phytoplankton, periphyton, two snail species, and larval amphibians. In the absence of macrophytes, single malathion pulses caused short-term declines in cladoceran abundance followed by their rapid recovery, which precluded any indirect effects (i.e. trophic cascades). However, repeated malathion pulses caused cladoceran extinctions, resulting in persistent phytoplankton blooms and reduced abundance of one snail species. In contrast, with macrophytes present, even at low density, malathion had no effect on any taxa. We also discovered novel effects of macrophytes on the benthic food web. In the two highest macrophyte treatments, we observed trends of reduced periphyton biomass, decreased abundance of one snail species, and decreased amphibian time to and mass at metamorphosis. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of negative submerged macrophyte effects on amphibians, a taxa of global conservation concern. Our findings suggest that facilitating macrophytes could be an important strategy for buffering freshwater communities from insecticides, though consideration of their impacts on animal species is necessary.","[Brogan, William R., III] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Relyea, Rick A.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12180 USA","Brogan, WR (corresponding author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",wbrogan@gmail.com,,,Sigma Xi [G20090315100640]; Society for Wetland Scientists; L.K.

The hydrilla tip mining midge, Cricotopus lebetis, a potential augmentative biological control agent of hydrilla, feeds on the apical meristem preventing growth. The goal of this study was to quantify the influence of a predator (mosquitofish, Gambusia sp.) and a competitor (hydrilla leafcutter moth, Parapoynx diminutalis) and their interactions, on the ability of the midge to survive and feed on hydrilla. The first experiment involved six treatments established in 37.8 L tanks with combinations of the organisms, including larval C. lebetis. Survival to adult midge eclosion was significantly reduced in the presence of the predator but was unaffected by the competitor's presence alone. Apical meristem damage was reduced when both the competitor and predator were present. The second experiment included four treatments with C. lebetis egg masses or larvae and the presence or absence of mosquitofish. Adding C. lebetis as eggs rather than as larvae increased midge survival in the absence of the predator. Midge survival was lower when larvae were added, but the predator had no additional effect. To facilitate successful establishment of the midge and control of hydrilla, high numbers of larvae should be released to overcome predation.","[Stachowiak, Courtney; Baniszewski, Julie; Cuda, James P.; Weeks, Emma N.

Experimental mesocosms were planted with live aquatic macrophytes and allowed to be naturally colonized by local invertebrates. Results indicated a positive effect of macrophyte diversity on competitor diversity and a negative effect on predator diversity. In turn, predator diversity negatively impacted mosquito abundance through a direct effect, while competitor diversity showed an indirect negative effect on mosquito larval abundance through its positive effect on predator diversity.

In response to predation stresses, prey rotifers develop morphological defenses and change their life-history strategy for the reallocation of energy investment. Yet, how these changes respond to different total energy ingestion remains largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the life-table demographic, population growth and morphological parameters of Brachionus calyciflorus in response to various densities of Asplanchna sieboldi at two food levels (1.0 x 10(6) and 2.0 x 10(6) cells per ml of Scenedesmus obliquus). To resist predators, B. calyciflorus developed long postero-lateral spines. The life-table demographic results showed that predation only significantly shortened the generation time of B. calyciflorus at the algal level of 2.0 x 10(6) cells per ml, but not affect other demographic parameters. The population growth tests revealed that predator density, algal level and their interactions all significantly influenced the population growth rate of prey rotifers. At 1.0 x 10(6) cells per ml of S. obliquus, treatments with two, four, and eight A. sieboldi individuals per 50ml significantly reduced the population growth rate of B. calyciflorus. In contrast, the population growth rate was not affected in response to two A. sieboldi individuals per 50ml at 2.0 x 10(6) cells per ml of S. obliquus. These results suggested that algal level probably affected the inhibitory effects of predation on the population growth of prey rotifers, and the underlying mechanisms should be further investigated.","[Pan, Ling; Xi, Yi-Long; Gu, Jing; Jiang, Shan; Zhu, Han; Zhang, Bing-Xing] Anhui Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Prov Lab Conservat & Utilizat Important Biol Reso, Wuhu, Anhui, Peoples R China","Xi, YL (corresponding author), Anhui Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 1 Beijing East Rd, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China.",ylxi1965@126.com,,,"Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31470015, 31170395]; Foundation of Provincial Key Laboratory of Biotic Environment and Ecological Safety in Anhui Province [2004sys003]",Grant sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of China; Grant number: 31470015 and 31170395; Grant sponsor: Foundation of Provincial Key Laboratory of Biotic Environment and Ecological Safety in Anhui Province; Grant number 2004sys003.,,42,3,4,2,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2471-5638,2471-5646,,J EXP ZOOL PART A,J.

Previous work has tested this hypothesis by evaluating food hoarding rates during foraging bouts when animals are exposed to different levels of competition for cache retrieval. Little is known about how competition might influence fine-scale food hoarding decisions within foraging bouts. I evaluated fine-scale food hoarding decisions of New Zealand Robins (Petroica australis) by offering mealworms to competitively dominant males and subordinate females, both when they were alone and when they foraged together. I then compared food hoarding rates of sequentially handled prey between sexes and social conditions by assessing how the total number of prey cached increased with the total number of prey handled. Relationships for solitary females, solitary males and paired males were non-linear, indicating that they were more likely to consume initially handled prey, and increasingly likely to cache subsequently handled prey items. Non-linear rates of food hoarding may result from declines in the energetic value of prey that are consumed and stored internally as birds become satiated. Somewhat differently, the relationship for paired females was linear, indicating that paired females make a single food hoarding decision based on bout-level foraging conditions, which results in constant fine-scale food hoarding rates. Constant food hoarding rates in paired females, which experience the strongest competitive effects of any treatment, suggest that food consumption is consistently more advantageous than food hoarding under these conditions, regardless of satiation level. Overall results from this study indicate that New Zealand Robins continuously update food hoarding decisions according to their competitive environment and satiation levels, resulting in scale-dependent patterns in food hoarding intensity.","Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand","Burns, KC (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",kevin.burns@vuw.ac.nz,,"Burns, K.C./0000-0002-4938-2877",Victoria University Animal Ethics Committee [2003R25],All experiments were conducted with permission of the Victoria University Animal Ethics Committee (2003R25) and with the permission of the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary.,,46,5,5,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0021-8375,,,J ORNITHOL,J.

Climate change in intertidal systems will comprise changes in both air and water temperatures, yet most previous marine intertidal studies have focused on either air or water temperature alone. In a 20 d laboratory study, we examined the effect of changing emersed and submersed body temperatures on the feeding and growth rates of Nucella ostrina, a common northeastern Pacific intertidal gastropod that feeds primarily on the barnacle Balanus glandula. Our results revealed a large increase in both predation and growth rates with higher submersion temperatures (13.5 degrees C compared with 11 degrees C). In contrast, we observed a large decrease in the feeding and growth of N. ostrina exposed to the highest emersed body temperature (28 degrees C) when compared with intermediate (20 degrees C) and cooler (12 degrees C) aerial temperatures. Thus, while B. glandula may suffer greater predation-related mortality in warmer water temperatures, it may actually experience a release from predation if air temperatures warm. Our study points to the importance of considering temperatures reached during both submersion and emersion separately, and examining behavioral responses in light of physiologically relevant temperatures and thermal regimes.","[Yamane, Lauren] Univ S Carolina, Marine Sci Program, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Gilman, Sarah E.] Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Labs, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA","Yamane, L (corresponding author), Univ S Carolina, Marine Sci Program, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",yamane@mailbox.sc.edu,,,NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNG04GE43G]; NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA04 NOS4780264],"We thank B.

A strain with a short generation time (Pseudomonas putida), one with high plasticity in cell morphology (Flectobacillus sp. GC5), and one that develops microcolonies (Pseudomonas sp. CM10), were selected. The voracious flagellate Ochromonas sp. was chosen as a predator. To describe adaptations against grazing and starvation, abundance, biomass and relative heterogeneity of bacteria were measured. On the whole, the strains in the predation-free cultures exhibited unicellular growth, and P. putida represented the largest group. The presence of Ochromonas strongly reduced bacterial abundance, but not always the total biomass. The activity of grazers changed the morphological composition of the bacterial communities. Under grazing pressure the relative composition of the community depended on the substrate availability. In the presence of predators, P. putida abundance declined in both high and low nutrient treatments, and Pseudomonas CM10 developed colonies. Flectobacillus was only numerically codominant in the nutrient-rich environments.","CNR, Inst Ecosyst Study, I-28922 Verbania Pallanz, Italy; Max Planck Inst Limnol, Plon, Germany","Corno, G (corresponding author), CNR, Inst Ecosyst Study, Largo Tonolli 50, I-28922 Verbania Pallanz, Italy.",g.corno@ise.cnr.it,"CORNO, GIANLUCA/AAB-8889-2019; Corno, Gianluca/K-1658-2018","CORNO, GIANLUCA/0000-0002-7423-8797; Corno, Gianluca/0000-0002-7423-8797",,,,44,21,22,0,13,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0168-6496,,,FEMS MICROBIOL ECOL,FEMS Microbiol.

In a preliminary experiment, groups of 10 convict cichlids, Archocentrus nigrofasciatus, were allowed to compete for food presented in either small (20.7 cm(2)) or large (208.7 cm(2)) patches. As predicted, the frequency of aggression and size variation within groups decreased and the number of fish feeding at any particular time increased as patch size increased. In small, defensible patches, the increased aggression by dominant individuals apparently excluded some fish from the foraging patch, causing an increase in size variation within groups. In a second experiment, we manipulated patch size and perceived predation risk (addition of conspecific skin extract versus distilled water) in a 2 x 2 factorial design. There were significant interactions between the two main effects for all three dependent variables. In small patches, increasing the perceived predation risk caused a decrease in aggression and size variation within groups and an increase in the number of fish foraging at a time, whereas in large patches, increasing the perceived predation risk had no significant effect on aggression, but decreased the number of fish feeding, resulting in an increase in size variation within groups. In defensible patches, increasing perceived predation risk had the same effect as reducing the economic defensibility of the patch. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Here, we study the oviposition behaviour of a predatory mite (Iphiseius degenerans) in relation to its prey, the western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis). This thrips is capable of killing the eggs of the predator. Thrips and predatory mites - apart from feeding on each other - can also feed and reproduce on a diet of pollen. Because thrips may aggregate at pollen patches, such patches may be risky for oviposition by the predatory mites. We found that, in absence of thrips, predatory mites lay their eggs close to pollen, but further away when thrips are present. Predatory mite eggs near pollen were killed more frequently by thrips than when they were deposited further away. The oviposition behaviour of the predatory mite was also studied in absence of thrips, but in presence of the alarm pheromone of thrips. This pheromone is normally secreted upon contact with predators or competitors. When applied close to the pollen, predatory mites oviposited significantly further away from it. When the alarm pheromone was applied away from the food source, most eggs were found near the pollen. These results indicate that female predatory mites show flexible oviposition behaviour in response to the presence of their counterattacking prey.","Univ Amsterdam, Sect Populat Biol, IBED, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands","Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Sect Populat Biol, IBED, POB 94084, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",janssen@science.uva.nl,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303",,,,31,31,34,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

Mortality of both R. temporaria and B. bufo larvae was high during the early stages of development, and interspecific competition was negligible in these ponds and in mesh cages suspended in them. However, growth of B. bufo larvae was reduced when they were raised with R. temporaria larvae at natural densities in plastic cages within the ponds. P. richardsi was positively associated with the plastic cage treatments, but was much less frequent in the ponds outside or in the mesh cage treatments.

However, the need for cover, or the need for a specific type of cover, may change as an individual grows in size, leading to niche shifts throughout development to meet these changing needs. In this study, we examine ontogenetic shifts in cover use by wild populations of a temperate reef fish, the southern hulafish, Trachinops caudimaculatus, a small, abundant planktivorous social aggregator found on temperate reefs in southern Australia. Through repeated in situ surveys, we found clear evidence of ontogenetic shifts in both microhabitat use and aggregation patterns by T. caudimaculatus juveniles in the first three months on the reef. The microhabitat associations of juvenile T. caudimaculatus became more similar to those of adult conspecifics over the study period, and over the same time frame, juveniles increasingly aggregated with adult shoals. Our findings also suggest that trade-offs between structural and social cover are context-dependent, with juveniles relying on structural cover longer when adult conspecific density (and thus intra-specific competition) and/or habitat complexity (and thus the availability of shelter) is high. These findings provide rare and important observations into the complex interplay of social aggregations, habitat use, and ontogeny in wild fish populations.","[Fobert, Emily K.; Swearer, Stephen E.] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Reeves, Simon E.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7004, Australia; [Reeves, Simon E.] Nat Conservancy Australia, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Swearer, Stephen E.] Univ Melbourne, Natl Ctr Coasts & Climate, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","Fobert, EK (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",emily.fobert@unimelb.edu.au,"Reeves, Simon E/AAJ-3379-2021; SWEARER, STEPHEN/X-4882-2018","SWEARER, STEPHEN/0000-0001-6381-9943; Fobert, Emily/0000-0001-5020-0615",Victorian Government's Seagrass and Reefs program; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment-Equity Trustees Charitable Foundation,"Field assistance for this study was provided by Chris Taylor.

Changing oceanographic conditions, competition from fishing operations, direct human-related mortality, and predators have been suggested as factors driving the decline, but the indirect and interactive nature of their effects on sea lions have made it difficult to attribute changes in abundance to specific factors. In part, this is because only changes in abundance, not changes in vital rates, are known. To determine how vital rates of the western Steller sea lion have changed during its 28-year decline, we first estimated the changes in Steller sea lion age structure using measurements of animals in aerial photographs taken during population surveys since 1985 in the central Gulf of Alaska (CGOA). We then fit an age-structured model with temporally varying vital rates to the age-structure data and to total population and pup counts. The model fits indicate that birth rate in the CGOA steadily declined from 1976 to 2004. Over the same period, survivorship first dropped severely in the early 1980s, when the population collapsed, and then survivorship steadily recovered. The best fitting model indicates that in 2004, the birth rate in the central Gulf of Alaska was 36% lower than in the 1970s, while adult and juvenile survivorship were close to or slightly above 1970s levels. These predictions and other model predictions concerning population structure match independent field data from mark-recapture studies and photometric analyses. The dominant eigenvalue for the estimated 2004 Leslie matrix is 1.0014, indicating a stable population. The stability, however, depends on very high adult survival, and the shift in vital rates results in a population that is more sensitive to changes in adult survivorship. Although our modeling analysis focused exclusively on the central Gulf of Alaska, the western Gulf of Alaska and eastern Aleutians show a similar pattern of declining pup fraction with no increase in the juvenile, or pre-breeding, fraction. This suggests that declining birth rate may be a problem for western Steller sea lions across the Gulf of Alaska and into the Aleutian Islands.","[Holmes, E.

Comparison of resource use at multiple locations with differing resource availability can allow fundamental specialists to be distinguished from species that simply feed predominantly on prey types that are locally abundant. This study investigates geographic variation in the feeding ecology of coral-feeding butterflyfishes to examine whether patterns of resource use and levels of dietary specialisation vary among distinct locations, corresponding with changes in resource availability. Our specific aims were to investigate whether the dietary niche breadth of four butterflyfishes varies among five geographically separated locations and assess whether each species utilises similar resources in each location. Resource availability and dietary composition of four butterflyfishes were quantified at three sites across each of five geographic locations throughout the Pacific. Niche breadth, niche overlap, and resource selection functions were calculated for each species at each site and compared among locations. Availability of dietary resources varied significantly among locations and sites. Chaetodon vagabundus, C. citrinellus and C. lunulatus had low levels of dietary specialisation and used different resources in each location. Chaetodon trifascialis had high levels of dietary specialisation and used the same few resources in each location. Our results indicate that relative levels of dietary specialisation among different butterflyfishes do hold at larger spatial scales, however, geographical variation in the dietary composition of all butterflyfishes indicates that prey availability has a fundamental influence on dietary composition. Highly specialised species such as C. trifascialis will be highly vulnerable to coral loss as they appear to be largely inflexible in their dietary composition. However, the increased feeding plasticity observed here for C. trifascialis suggests this species may have a greater capacity to respond to coral loss than previously assumed.","[Lawton, Rebecca J.; Cole, Andrew J.; Pratchett, Morgan S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Lawton, Rebecca J.; Berumen, Michael L.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia","Lawton, RJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",rebecca.lawton@my.jcu.edu.au,"cole, andrew J/L-5764-2013; Pratchett, Morgan/AAW-5179-2020; Cole, Andrew/G-5220-2011; Berumen, Michael L/F-7745-2011; Lawton, Rebecca/E-5711-2014; Lawton, Rebecca/A-6149-2012; Pratchett, Morgan S/A-9256-2010","Pratchett, Morgan/0000-0002-1862-8459; Berumen, Michael L/0000-0003-2463-2742; Lawton, Rebecca/0000-0001-6296-6415; Pratchett, Morgan S/0000-0002-1862-8459",Queensland Government; Wildlife Preservation Society of Australia; American Australian Association; Lizard Island Research Station (a facility of The Australian Museum); Project Aware; Australian Coral Reef Society,"We thank D.

Cane toads (Chaunus [Bufo] marinus) were introduced to Queensland in 1935, and have now spread across much of tropical Australia. One plausible impact of toad invasion concerns competition between toads and native frogs, but there has been no previous experimental evaluation of this possibility. We examined interactions between toads and a morphologically similar species of native frog (Cyclorana australis) by manipulating toad and frog densities within large outdoor enclosures beside a floodplain in the wet-dry tropics of the Northern Territory. Toads differed from frogs significantly in dietary composition and feeding rates, even in comparisons controlling for body-size differences between these two taxa. Perhaps reflecting the abundant insect biomass, manipulating anuran densities or the presence of the putatively competing species did not influence food intake or dietary composition. However, the presence of toads suppressed activity levels of native frogs. The degree to which the invasion of cane toads influences attributes such as the activity levels, food intake and dietary composition of native frogs warrants further study, but our study suggests that competitive effects are likely to be minor compared with other pathways (such as direct poisoning during ingestion attempts) by which toads can affect frog populations.","Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Shine, R (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",rics@bio.usyd.edu.au,"Shine, Richard/B-8711-2008; Phillips, Ben/C-7957-2009; Brown, Gregory P./F-9897-2011","Phillips, Ben/0000-0003-2580-2336; Brown, Gregory P./0000-0002-2924-9040; Webb, Jonathan/0000-0003-4822-6829",,,,51,36,39,0,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,DEC,2007,32,8,,,,,900,907,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2007.01778.x,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,228VM,WOS:000250760700007,,,,,2021-09-27,

Larvae of cased caddisflies (Limnephilidae and Phryganeidae) are among the most abundant and conspicuous invertebrates in northern wetlands. Although species replacements are often observed along permanence gradients, the underlying causal mechanisms are poorly understood. In this paper, we report on the distributional patterns of caddisflies in permanent and temporary high-altitude ponds, and how those patterns reflect differences in life history characteristics that affect desiccation tolerance (fundamental niches) versus constraints related to biotic interactions (realised niches). 2. Species (Hesperophylax occidentalis and Agrypnia deflata ) that were encountered only in permanent ponds are restricted in distribution by life history (no ovarian diapause, aquatic oviposition, and/or inability to tolerate desiccation). Although the egg masses of H. occidentalis tolerate desiccation, the larvae leave the protective gelatinous matrix of the egg mass because adults oviposit in water. 3. Three species (Asynarchus nigriculus, Limnephilus externus and L. picturatus ) have life history characteristics (rapid larval growth, ovarian diapause and terrestrial oviposition of desiccation-tolerant eggs) that should facilitate the use of both permanent and temporary habitats. However, A. nigriculus is rare or absent in most permanent ponds, and L. externus and L . picturatus are rare or absent in most temporary ponds. Experimental data from a previous study on the combined effects of salamander predation and interspecific interactions among caddisflies (e.g. intraguild predation) suggest that biotic interactions limit each species to a subset of potentially exploitable habitats. 4. Many wetland invertebrates exhibit species replacements along permanence gradients, but few studies have separated the relative importance of the effects of drying per se from the effects of biotic interactions. Our results emphasise the complementary roles of comparative data on life histories and experimental data on competition and predation for understanding invertebrate distributions along permanence gradients.","Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; Allegheny Coll, Dept Environm Sci, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA","Wissinger, SA (corresponding author), Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA.",swissing@allegheny.edu,"Jannot, Jason/ABD-5400-2020","Jannot, Jason/0000-0002-9231-1337; Brown, Wendy/0000-0002-7237-1797",,,,58,56,60,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

We investigated the hypothesis that cyclic lemming populations indirectly affect arctic nesting greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens atlanticus L.) through the behavioural and numerical responses of shared predators. 2. The study took place on Bylot Island in the Canadian High Arctic during two lemming cycles. We recorded changes in foraging behaviour and activity rate of arctic foxes, parasitic jaegers, glaucous gulls and common ravens in a goose colony during one lemming cycle and we monitored denning activity of foxes for 7 years. We also evaluated the total response of predators (i.e. number of eggs depreciated). 3. Arctic foxes were more successful in attacking lemmings than goose nests because predators were constrained by goose nest defence. Predators increased their foraging effort on goose eggs following a lemming decline. 4. Activity rates in the goose colony varied 3.5-fold in arctic foxes and 4.8-fold in parasitic jaegers. and were highest 2 and 3 years after the lemming peak. respectively. The breeding output of arctic foxes appeared to be driven primarily by lemming numbers. 5. Predators consumed 19-88% of the annual goose nesting production and egg predation intensity varied 2-7-fold, being lowest during peak lemming years.

The authors have examined the applicability of its software, PHABSIM, in Southern Africa, during a preliminary study of the endemic fish fauna of the Olifants River, western Cape Province. Despite little change in water quality and flow patterns in the upper mainstream over the last 50 years, most of these fish are now confined to remote headwater tributaries, presumably through the introduction of an alien predator/competitor - the smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieui. It was investigated if, with removal or reduction in numbers of the alien fish species, the endemic fish would still have sufficient physical habitat to re-establish themselves in the mainstream. Additionally, as the river is to be dammed in its upper reaches soon, an attempt was made to provide a preliminary minimum flow assessment. This could be used by local water-resource managers in initial development plans as well as providing information on the utility of IFIM in this region of Africa. The simulations have predicted that there is considerable physical habitat available for the endemic fish species in the mainstream and, for some species, more habitat than for the introduced alien. This supports the claim that predation and/or competition by smallmouth bass has been primarily responsible for the eradication of the endemic species from the mainstream. A preliminary minimum flow recommendation for maintaining re-introduced endemic species during the summer low-flows was 0,8 cumecs (m3/s), very close to the 0,9 cumecs measured during summer in the unimpounded upper reaches of the system, which are subject to heavy water extractions for irrigation.","CAPE CHIEF DIRECTORATE NAT & ENVIRONM CONSERVAT,STELLENBOSCH 7600,SOUTH AFRICA; UNIV CAPE TOWN,DEPT ZOOL,FRESHWATER RES INST,RONDEBOSCH 7700,SOUTH AFRICA","GORE, JA (corresponding author), AUSTIN PEAY STATE UNIV,CTR FIELD BIOL,POB 4718,CLARKSVILLE,TN 37044, USA.",,,,,,,33,23,29,0,7,WATER RESEARCH COMMISSION,PRETORIA,"PO BOX 824, PRETORIA 0001, SOUTH AFRICA",0378-4738,,,WATER SA,Water SA,JUL,1991,17,3,,,,,225,236,,,,,12,Water Resources,Water Resources,GA333,WOS:A1991GA33300008,,,,,2021-09-27,

The Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis) is a freshwater fish endemic to Chukotka and Alaska north of the Alaska Range (Beringia); the species was introduced outside of its native range to the Cook Inlet Basin of Alaska in the 1950s, where it has since become widespread. Here we characterize the diet of Alaska blackfish at three Cook Inlet Basin sites, including a lake, a stream, and a wetland. We analyze stomach plus esophageal contents to assess potential impacts on native species via competition or predation. Alaska blackfish in the Cook Inlet Basin consume a wide range of prey, with major prey consisting of epiphytic/benthic dipteran larvae, gastropods, and ostracods. Diets of the introduced populations of Alaska blackfish are similar in composition to those of native juvenile salmonids and stickleback. Thus, Alaska blackfish may affect native fish populations via competition. Fish ranked third in prey importance for both lake and stream blackfish diets but were of minor importance for wetland blackfish.","[Eidam, Dona M.; Carlson, Matthew L.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Biol Sci, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [von Hippel, Frank A.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 617 S Beaver St,POB 5640, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Carlson, Matthew L.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Alaska Ctr Conservat Sci, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Lassuy, Dennis R.] North Slope Sci Initiat, 222 West 7th Ave,13, Anchorage, AK 99513 USA; [Lopez, J.

Among the different types of naturally occurring micro- and mesocosms, clusters of rock pools combine a global distribution with the simplicity, replicability, tractability and structural homogeneity that are desirable in model experimental systems. However, critical geographical data gaps in the study of rock pools must be filled if ecologists are to use these as global model systems in community ecology. In a year-long study of a cluster of 181 rock pools in the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil, we conducted the first study on the ecology of freshwater rock pool communities in the entire Neotropical region, to the best of our knowledge. Building on published descriptions of the factors that drive community assembly within rock pools, we tested the hypotheses (1) that the effects of environmental factors prevail over those of spatial factors and (2) that pool volume and secondarily species interactions between consumers (anuran larvae), resources (leaf litter) and predators (dragonfly larvae) have a dominant role in driving species patterns of occurrence and abundance. Our hypotheses were generally supported as community structure was clearly influenced by the environmental characteristics of individual pools, and not to the spatial relations among them. Pool volume had a consistent, positive influence on the probability of occurrence of dragonflies and tadpoles of three anuran species, possibly through the influence of volume on hydroperiod. However, the species most strongly associated with larger pools were not those with longer times until metamorphosis, but those with larger egg clutches. In addition, species occurrences were positively associated with resource availability as measured by leaf litter mass (significantly so for Rhinella and dragonflies). These observations suggest that within these severely confined freshwater systems, indicators of environmental stability and reduced intraspecific competition could be important ultimate criteria for oviposition site selection. The ease of sampling and manipulating the rock pools at our Atlantic Forest site combined with the observation that these pools are governed by some of the same factors influencing community organisation in other rock pool systems around the world reinforces the merit of the system as a means to conduct global comparative studies of the ecology of communities and metacommunities.","[Schiesari, Luis; Monteiro, Artur Sgambatti] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Artes Ciencias & Humanidades, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Schiesari, Luis; Ilha, Paulo] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Ecol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Pope, Nathaniel; Correa, Decio Tadeu] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Ilha, Paulo] Inst Pesquisa Ambiental Amazonia, Canarana, Brazil","Schiesari, L (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Artes Ciencias & Humanidades, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",lschiesa@usp.br,"Schiesari, Luis C/E-8624-2012; Ilha, Paulo/K-8026-2019; Ilha, Paulo/U-3355-2019; Correa, Decio T/C-2726-2016","Schiesari, Luis C/0000-0003-0814-591X; Ilha, Paulo/0000-0003-3431-908X; Correa, Decio T/0000-0002-6579-306X",CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [470934/20042]; FAPESP/BIOEN-Bioenergy Research Program [2008/57939-9]; FAPESP/Research Program on Global Climate Change [2015/18790-3]; CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [1176/13-7],"CNPq, Grant/Award Number: 470934/20042; FAPESP/BIOEN-Bioenergy Research Program, Grant/Award Number: 2008/57939-9; FAPESP/Research Program on Global Climate Change, Grant/Award Number: 2015/18790-3; CAPES, Grant/Award Number: 1176/13-7",,40,3,3,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

We posited that biotic interactions, particularly predation, interspecific competition, and herbivory assumed a primary top-down role in affecting small mammals and annual plants here. Using a multi factorial design we selectively excluded vertebrate predators (principally carnivores and raptors) and a large small mammal herbivore, the degu (Octodon degus), from replicated 0.56 ha exclosures located in a valley near the coast in Bosque Fray Jorge National Park. Evidence initially supported effects of predator exclusion on O. degus but not for other small mammals in the assemblage (e.g., Phyllotis darwini, Abrothrix olivaceus). Subsequent years of monitoring have documented that predation has temporary effects on degu numbers, but that populations of this and other small mammals are much more strongly influenced by environmental bottom-up factors (i.e., rainfall). Further, our experimental manipulation has provided no evidence for negative interspecific competition effects on numbers of any small mammal in this assemblage. Degu exclusions, however, have had negative indirect effects on exotic annuals; native annuals appear to outcompete exotics especially during drought years The effect is magnified in all-small mammal exclusions. Since about 2002, selective exclusions of lagomorphs and small mammals have resulted in changes in cover of some perennial shrubs. Also notable has been a fundamental shift in the small mammal composition following the last major El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event in 2000 2002; degus now comprise a majority of small mammal biomass in the assemblage, and their numbers have become more stable and less temporally variable. This appears to have been caused by a shift in rainfall periodicity from strong interannual fluctuations in response to periodic ENSOs, to a more equitable pattern with more consistent annual rainfall. This represents one of the first documented cases of system-wide biotic phase shifts to a relatively modest change in rainfall regime. This may be indicative of ongoing climate change in the Chilean semiarid region, and we expect that further changes in the community will occur if those trends continue. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Our objectives were to determine whether (1) diet overlap and predation occurred between adult Walleyes and Largemouth Bass in four northern Wisconsin lakes and (2) the use of DNA barcoding to reduce unidentifiable fish in diet samples affected conclusions regarding diet overlap. A single occurrence of Walleye predation was observed in the diets of 945 Largemouth Bass. Moderate to high diet overlap was observed between Largemouth Bass and Walleyes throughout much of the study period. The use of DNA barcoding reduced the amount of unidentified fish in diets to <1% and showed that failure to identify fish or fish parts can affect conclusions regarding diet overlap. Largemouth Bass predation is probably not a primary factor affecting Walleye abundance in the lakes we selected, but observed diet overlap suggests the potential for competition between the two species.","[Kelling, Craig J.] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Fisheries Anal Ctr, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Isermann, Daniel A.] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Isermann, Daniel A.] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Fisheries Anal Ctr, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Sloss, Brian L.; Turnquist, Keith N.] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Mol Conservat Genet Lab, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Kelling, Craig J.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Wildlife & Sportfish Restorat Program, Bloomington, MN 55437 USA","Isermann, DA (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA.; Isermann, DA (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Coll Nat Resources, Fisheries Anal Ctr, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA.",dan.isermann@uwsp.edu,,,USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center,"We thank numerous students for field and laboratory assistance.

When population densities become high, tadpoles often become cannibalistic, likely in response to intense competition. Conspecific tissues are potentially an ideal diet by composition and should greatly improve growth and development. However, the potential release of alarm cues from the tissues of injured conspecifics may act to deter potential cannibals from feeding. We conducted multiple feeding experiments to test the relative effects that a diet of conspecifics has on tadpole growth and development. Results indicate that while conspecific tissues represent a better alternative to starvation and provide some benefits over low-protein diets, such a diet can have detrimental effects to tadpole growth and/or development relative to diets of similar protein content. Additionally, tadpoles raised individually appear to avoid consuming conspecific tissues and may continue to do so until they suffer from the effects of starvation. However, tadpoles readily fed upon conspecific tissues immediately when raised with competitors. These results suggest that cannibalism may occur as a result of competition rather than the specific quality of available diets, unless such diets lead to starvation.","[Jefferson, Dale M.; Demuth, Brandon S.; Chivers, Douglas P.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada; [Hobson, Keith A.] Environm Canada, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada; [Ferrari, Maud C.

Since, many biochemical transformations within the nitrogen cycle are performed by bacteria, ciliates could have an indirect impact on the nitrogen cycle through selective grazing on nitrogen-transforming bacteria. As a case study, we examined ciliate grazing on nitrifying bacteria of the genera Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira. All experiments were designed as in vitro-experiments with cultures of different bacteria and ciliate species. The nitrifying bacteria used in our experiments were Nitrosomonas europaea [Winogradsky 1892] and Nitrospira moscoviensis [Ehrich 2001]. The ciliates comprised of four species that are known as efficient bacterivores and common members of the protist community in aquatic systems: Paramecium aurelia [Muller 1773], Euplotes octocarinatus [Carter 1972], Tetrahymena pyriformis [Ehrenberg 1830] and Cyclidium glaucoma [Muller 1786]. Our experimental approach, using a combination of DAPI and FISH staining, was successful in allowing the observation of ingestion of specific bacteria and their detection within ciliate food vacuoles. However, the ciliates in this study showed no significant selective grazing. No food preferences for a any bacterial taxon or any size class or morphotype were detected. Correlation with time between ciliate abundance and bacterial abundance or biovolume, using log transformed growth rates of ciliates and bacteria, showed no significant results. On the bacterial side, neither an active defence mechanism of the nitrifying bacteria against ciliate grazing, such as changes in morphology, nor competition for resources were observed. These results suggest that in our in vitro-experiments grazing by ciliates has no influence on abundance and growth of nitrifying bacteria and nitrification.","[Neubacher, Elke; Prast, Mario; Berninger, Ulrike-Gabriele] Salzburg Univ, Dept Organism Biol, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Cleven, Ernst-Josef] Univ Munster, Dept Limnol, Munster, Germany","Neubacher, E (corresponding author), Salzburg Univ, Dept Organism Biol, Hellbrunnerstr 34, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.",Elke.Neubacher@sbg.ac.at,,,,,,37,10,10,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JAN,2008,596,,,,,,241,250,,10.1007/s10750-007-9100-7,,,10,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,242MR,WOS:000251729800021,,,,,2021-09-27,

Densities of Oligochaeta (families Tubificidae and Enchytraeidae), Amphipoda, Insecta larvae, Polychaeta and macro-Nematoda, and a broad range of environmental factors were followed over 5 mo of caging. A significant increase of amphipod and insect larvae densities in the cages indicated a positive exclusion effect, while no such effect was observed for oligochaetes (Tubificidae in particular), polychaetes or macronematodes. Resource competitive interactions were a plausible explanation for the status of the amphipod community.

The nest microbial environment that birds experience during early life might also affect their development and thus, faecal sacs facilitating parental removal may be a strategy to decrease bacterial contamination of nests that could harm developing nestlings. Here, we tested this hypothesis by experimentally broken faecal sacs and spreading them in nests of spotless starlings Sturnus unicolor, thereby avoiding their removal by adults. In accordance with the hypothesis, experimental nests harboured higher bacterial density than control nests. Nestlings in experimental nests were of smaller size (tarsus length) and experienced lower probability of survival (predation) than those in control nests. Moreover, nestlings in experimental nests tended to suffer more from ectoparasites than those in control nests. We discuss the possible pivotal role of bacteria producing chemical volatiles that ectoparasites and predators might use to find avian nests, and that could explain our experimental results in starlings.","[Azcarate-Garcia, Manuel; Ruiz-Rodriguez, Magdalena; Ruiz-Castellano, Cristina; Jose Soler, Juan] CSIC, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, EEZA, Almeria, Spain; [Ruiz-Rodriguez, Magdalena] Sorbonne Univ, Observ Oceanol, Biol Integrat Organismes Marins, Banyuls Sur Mer, France; [Jose Soler, Juan] Univ Granada, Unidad Asociada Coevoluc Cucos Hospedadores & Bac, Granada, Spain; [Diaz-Lora, Silvia] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Zool, Granada, Spain","Azcarate-Garcia, M (corresponding author), CSIC, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, EEZA, Almeria, Spain.",mazcarategarcia@eeza.csic.es,"Ruiz-Rodriguez, Magdalena/D-4226-2014; Soler, J.

Several reports have documented the establishment of Redside Shiners Richardsonius balteatus in mountain lakes, resulting in declines in sizes and abundance of salmonid species. An illegal bait bucket release introduced Redside Shiners into Green Canyon Lake, Montana, USA, in the 1980s. Recently, local anglers began complaining of decreases in size and catch rates of Westslope Cutthroat Trout (WCT) Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi. Our first objective was to understand the diet overlap between Redside Shiners and WCT in Green Canyon Lake. Based on delta N-15 and delta C-13 isotopic signatures and diet contents, we found little evidence that WCT were substantially preying upon Redside Shiners. We found moderate diet overlap between WCT and Redside Shiners, with both species predominately feeding on Diptera. For our second objective, we developed a population model to assess potential options for eradicating Redside Shiners. We observed Redside Shiners up to 7 years of age and with a maximum TL of 159 mm, high annual survival (50%), and mature females at age 2. We used an age-structured model to evaluate two hypothetical suppression actions: piscicide application and stocking of Rainbow Trout O. mykiss. Four consecutive piscicide treatments had a 20% probability of eradicating Redside Shiners, increasing to a 100% eradication probability after seven treatments. Bioenergetic simulations indicated that an individual Rainbow Trout (500 g) would consume 1,759 g of Redside Shiners annually. Incorporating this predation mortality and a compensatory response (50% increase in age-1 survival), we estimated that maintained abundances of up to 700 Rainbow Trout would not cause a decline in the Redside Shiner population. Our results suggest that eradication of an introduced prey fish like the Redside Shiner would be difficult and that effective removal will require dedicated effort and resources by managers.","[Smith, Troy W.; Eby, Lisa A.] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Wildlife Biol Program, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Liermann, Brad W.] Montana Fish Wildlife & Pk, 3201 Spurgin Rd, Missoula, MT 59804 USA","Smith, TW (corresponding author), Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Wildlife Biol Program, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",troy.smith@umontana.edu,,,"McIntire-Stennis Grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture [MONZ17004, 1012434 520]; Irene Evers Undergraduate Competitive Scholarship","We would first like to acknowledge that this study occurred in the aboriginal lands of the Salish and Kootenai People.

The main objective of this study is to make pattern classification and recognition on sampling information using two self-organizing neural network models. Invertebrate functional groups sampled in the irrigated rice field were classified and recognized using one-dimensional self-organizing map and self-organizing competitive learning neural networks. Comparisons between neural network models, distance (similarity) measures, and number of neurons were conducted. The results showed that self-organizing map and self-organizing competitive learning neural network models were effective in pattern classification and recognition of sampling information. Overall the performance of one-dimensional self-organizing map neural network was better than self-organizing competitive learning neural network. The number of neurons could determine the number of classes in the classification. Different neural network models with various distance (similarity) measures yielded similar classifications. Some differences, dependent upon the specific network structure, would be found. The pattern of an unrecognized functional group was recognized with the self-organizing neural network. A relative consistent classification indicated that the following invertebrate functional groups, terrestrial blood sucker; terrestrial flyer; tourist (nonpredatory species with no known functional role other than as prey in ecosystem); gall former; collector (gather, deposit feeder); predator and parasitoid; leaf miner; idiobiont (acarine ectoparasitoid), were classified into the same group, and the following invertebrate functional groups, external plant feeder; terrestrial crawler, walker, jumper or hunter; neustonic (water surface) swimmer (semi-aquatic), were classified into another group. It was concluded that reliable conclusions could be drawn from comparisons of different neural network models that use different distance (similarity) measures. Results with the larger consistency will be more reliable.","Zhongshan Sun Yat Sen Univ, Res Inst Entomol, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China","Zhang, WJ (corresponding author), Zhongshan Sun Yat Sen Univ, Res Inst Entomol, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.",zhwj@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,,,,18,7,8,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,1573-2959,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

Of particular concern is the increase in early seral vegetation in high-elevation caribou summer habitat created by the recent expansion of logging into these forests. Deep snow confines the relatively abundant moose (Alces alces) population to valleys during winter, but in summer they can move up slope, where their spatial overlap with caribou increases. Wolves (Canis lupus) follow moose, their primary prey, up slope and occasionally encounter and kill caribou. We tested the hypothesis that early seral vegetation in high-elevation cutblocks (i.e., logged areas) attracts moose into mountain caribou summer habitat, and thereby increases the spatial overlap between caribou, moose, and wolves. To test our hypothesis, we examined how moose selection for early seral vegetation changed with elevation, how moose used undisturbed habitat, and how the proportion of early seral vegetation at high elevations in a moose home range was related to the amount of time moose spent at high elevations. Moose selection for cutblocks increased with elevation; however, when moose were at high elevations they spent the majority of their time in old-growth forest where they were likely browsing on understory shrubs, and the area of high-elevation cutblocks in moose home ranges did not affect the amount of time moose spent at high elevations. When we further explored the relationship between the amount of early seral vegetation at high elevations and the amount of time moose spent at high elevations, we found moose spent more time at high elevations when total early seral vegetation (from natural sources and cutblocks) increased, but there was little evidence that either type, on their own, influenced moose to use higher elevations. We conclude that although moose select cutblocks, the influence of high-elevation cutblocks on moose was minor in our study. Our results and those of other studies suggests low-elevation logging in moose winter ranges has led to an increased number of moose, and likely has a greater effect on moose distribution than logging at higher elevations. These insights can help guide management of apparent competition between moose and caribou.

Thus, competitive interactions may take place. Fish have been introduced to many formerly fishless lakes, which has profoundly affected the competitive and predatory relations in these waters. In this paper we review recent findings on duck fish competitive interactions in boreal lakes. On a general level, analyses based on presence/absence data of fish have indicated that ducks can be negatively affected by fish. More rigorous studies where fish density has been considered have corroborated the pattern emerging from presence/absence studies. For the Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) and Eurasian Perch (Perca fluviatilis), the effect of competition has been tested experimentally. In general, it appears that diving ducks such as Common Goldeneye, which forage in open water, are the most affected by fish, Common Teal (Arias crecca) is intermediate, whereas Mallard (A. platyrhynchos), which forage among the shore vegetation, is little affected. Likelihood or the strength of competition between ducks and fish may also depend on habitat productivity and structure. Numbers of invertebrates are higher among vegetation where there are less fish preying on them. Duck fish interactions are important to take into account when planning wetland creation and restoration for ducks. There is also an urgent need to mitigate the effects of fish introductions in wetlands.","[Nummi, Petri; Vaananen, Veli-Matti; Holopainen, Sari] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Poysa, Hannu] Nat Resources Inst Finland, Yliopistokatu 6, Joensuu 80100, Finland","Nummi, P (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",petri.nummi@helsinki.fi,"Nummi, Petri/AAU-9666-2021","Holopainen, Sari/0000-0002-3271-4468; Nummi, Petri/0000-0003-1452-4633",,,,80,13,13,0,17,BIRDLIFE FINLAND,HELSINKI,"PO BOX 1285, HELSINKI, 00101, FINLAND",0030-5685,,,ORNIS FENNICA,Ornis Fenn.,,2016,93,1,,,,,67,76,,,,,10,Ornithology,Zoology,DL3FU,WOS:000375520400008,,,,,2021-09-27,

Many highly threatened CWR mammals, such as bilbies, bandicoots and numbats, are insectivorous or omnivorous, and invertebrates comprise a significant portion of their diet. Additionally, such mammals cause significant disturbance to arthropod habitats through burrowing and engage in a range of other interactions with arthropods, including mutualisms, parasitism and competition. The loss of this trophic level is thus likely to have had considerable impacts on arthropods. Here, I consider the potential effects of the dramatic decline of native omnivores on the abundance, diversity, composition, morphology and functional roles performed by arthropods. I also discuss reintroductions such as that at Scotia Sanctuary in western NSW and other conservation sites as a model for understanding the pre-European state of arthropod-CWR mammal interactions.","La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia","Gibb, H (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia.",h.gibb@latrobe.edu.au,"Gibb, Heloise/B-8338-2013",,,,,62,14,15,0,17,LINNEAN SOC NEW SOUTH WALES,NEW SOUTH WALES,"PO BOX 137, MATRAVILLE, NEW SOUTH WALES, 2036, AUSTRALIA",0370-047X,,,P LINN SOC N S W,Proc.

How such proximate cues in the environment correspond to the ultimate behaviour of the prey are important for understanding the outcome of predator-prey interactions. The precision of the anti-predator response of juvenile perch, Perca fluviatilis, and roach, Rutilus rutilus, when subjected to predation by piscivorous perch and pike, Esox lucius, and to different types of structure was tested in a wading pool experiment. The predation risk was varied between two habitats (one open water and one structured) by confining the predators to one of the two habitats. The prey were free to choose between habitats. Both perch and pike attacked both prey species but they were only successful in capturing roach. Roach swam faster than juvenile perch in the presence of perch, whereas juvenile perch swam faster than roach in the presence of pike. Juvenile perch inspected the predators more and showed a more flexible inspection behaviour than did roach. Juvenile perch decreased the number of switches between habitats and stayed in the predator-free part of the pool in the presence of perch. In contrast, roach increased their habitat switch frequency in the presence of perch and stayed in the vegetation structure even when there were perch there. Both prey species preferred to stay in the vegetation structure when pike were there. Juvenile perch used both the vegetation and pipe structure as refuges whereas roach used only the vegetation structure as a refuge. The results suggest that juvenile perch use a different cue when assessing predation risk and display a more flexible behaviour compared with roach which simply move into vegetation under the threat of predation irrespective of predator location.

We conducted field experiments to examine the sensitivity of taxa that inhabit seasonal wetlands and to determine whether salt contamination could increase the production of ovipositing insects. In two outdoor mesocosm experiments, cladocerans and copepods rarely survived concentrations of commercial road salt > 1,200 mg L-1, while wood frog eggs and hatchlings (Lithobates sylvaticus) were not strongly impacted until concentrations exceeded 4,500 mg L-1. Shore flies (Ephydridae), mosquitoes (Culex restuans; Anopheles punctipennis) and midge larvae (Chironomidae) were more salt tolerant than macrozooplankton. These taxa tended to be absent or relatively rare in experimental mesocosms with low salinities, but abundant in mesocosms with intermediate to high salinities. We conducted two additional experiments to examine whether adult choice of oviposition sites may in part explain the rarity of Cx. restuans in pools with low salinity. These revealed that Cx. restuans reduced oviposition rates in water-filled containers with cladocerans, and reduced clutch size in the presence of Lithobates larvae. However, salt concentration per se did not influence the propensity of Cx. restuans to oviposit. Collectively, our results suggest that aquatic habitats that are biologically compromised by deicing agents favor salt-tolerant insects, and that the use of road salts could increase the production of adult mosquitoes that are pests and vectors of disease.","[Petranka, James W.; Doyle, Edward J.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Asheville, NC 28804 USA","Petranka, JW (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, 1 Univ Hts, Asheville, NC 28804 USA.",petranka@unca.edu,,,,,,41,38,39,2,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,1573-5125,,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

This makes their conclusions or predictions difficult to evaluate. In out study, we used 20 years of demographic data on Serengeti cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) to conduct a population viability analysis First we constructed a model of the deterministic growth rate and found that the cheetah population is nearly self-replacing (lambda = 0.997). Our model showed that population growth was most strongly influenced by adult survival, followed by juvenile survival, which is typical of long-lived, iteroparous species. We then examined extinction risk and long-term projections of cheetah population size with our stochastic mode, Popgen, We compared the projections with over 20 years of field data and found that demographic stochasticity trials produced a stable population size, whereas environmental stochasticity trials were slightly more pessimistic. Extinction risk was highly sensitive to both adult survival and juvenile survival (from 0-1 years). Decreasing the variance in survival rates also decreased extinction risk. Because lions are the major predator on cheetah cubs, we used our demographic records to simulate the effect of different lion numbers on juvenile survival. High lion abundance and average lion abundance resulted in extinction of nearly all cheetah populations by 50 years, whereas with low lion abundance most cheetah populations remained extant. Conservation of cheetahs may not rely solely on their protection inside national parks, but may also rely on their protection in natural areas outside national parks where other large predators are absent.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London NW1 4RY, England","Kelly, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",mjkelly@ucdavis.edu,"Kelly, Marcella J/B-4891-2011; Durant, Sarah M/AAB-9659-2019","Durant, Sarah M/0000-0003-0724-0878",,,,63,38,39,0,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Numbers of nesting Caspian terns (Hydroprogne caspia) and double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) were stable at about 700-1,000 breeding pairs at five colonies and about 1,200-1,500 breeding pairs at four colonies, respectively. Numbers of American white pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) increased at Badger Island, the sole breeding colony for the species on the Columbia Plateau, from about 900 individuals in 2007 to over 2,000 individuals in 2010. Overall numbers of breeding California gulls (Larus californicus) and ring-billed gulls (L. delawarensis) declined during the study, mostly because of the abandonment of a large colony in the mid-Columbia River. Three gull colonies below the confluence of the Snake and Columbia rivers increased substantially, however. Factors that may limit colony size and productivity for piscivorous waterbirds nesting on the Columbia Plateau included availability of suitable nesting habitat, interspecific competition for nest sites, predation, gull kleptoparasitism, food availability, and human disturbance. Based on observed population trends alone, there is little reason to project increased impacts to juvenile salmonid survival from tern and cormorant populations. Additional monitoring and evaluation may be warranted to assess future impacts of the growing Badger Island American white pelican colony and those gull colonies located near mainstem dams or associated with Caspian tern colonies where kleptoparasitism is common.","[Adkins, Jessica Y.; Lyons, Donald E.; Loschl, Peter J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Roby, Daniel D.] Oregon State Univ, US Geol Survey, Oregon Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Collis, Ken; Evans, Allen F.; Hostetter, Nathan J.] Real Time Res Inc, Bend, OR 97702 USA","Collis, K (corresponding author), Real Time Res Inc, 52 SW Roosevelt Ave, Bend, OR 97702 USA.",ken@realtimeresearch.com,,,U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)-Walla Walla District; U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR),"The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)-Walla Walla District and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) provided funding for this research; we thank C.

Here, we sought to understand the bottom-up effects of plant genetic variation on herbivore preference and performance, and the top-down control of predators on herbivores and their joint effects on plant fitness and evolution. Following three ecological genetics field experiments we detected heritable variation in plant traits that influenced both the preference and performance of a specialist weevil on Oenothera biennis. However, the weevil's preference and performance were not genetically correlated among O. biennis plant genotypes. Although predators and parasitoids were abundant, predators had no detectable effect on weevil performance because high egg and larval mortality was caused by non-predatory factors such as intraspecific competition. Finally, neither the specialist weevil nor predators influenced plant fitness. Our results suggest that the focal tritrophic community studied here is primarily shaped by the bottom-up effects of plant genetic variation on herbivores, while top-down effects have no clear impacts on O. biennis fitness or evolution. We suggest that future studies should incorporate plant intraspecific genetic variation as a fundamental part of tritrophic interactions including their eco-evolutionary dynamics.","[Carmona, Diego; Johnson, Marc T.

A simulation model is used to examine the spatial pattern of resource depletion imposed by vertebrates foraging in a heterogeneous environment; this may have important consequences for the dynamics of resource populations. It is assumed that consumers distribute themselves to maximize intake rates, that mutual interference occurs between competing consumers, and that the coefficient of interference, m, is less than one. 2. Where individuals are equal in their susceptibility to interference, depletion is density-dependent and variation in resource density is reduced towards zero. However, individuals often differ in their susceptibility to interference and incorporating such individual variation modifies the expected pattern of depletion. Spatial variation in resource density is no longer reduced to zero. After consumption of a given proportion of the total resource, spatial variation in the density of that remaining is greater when there is stronger interference, greater individual variation in susceptibility to interference, or a larger consumer population. With large individual variation and a large consumer population, domed or inversely density-dependent patterns of depletion are predicted, even where the coefficient of interference, m, is less than 1. 3. Field studies that quantify depletion of resource patches within the sampling range of a vertebrate population are reviewed and related to patterns predicted by the simulation model. The correlation between depletion and initial resource density is positive in 22 of 24 cases and significantly density-dependent (P < 0.05) in 11 of these, while only one correlation is significantly inversely density-dependent. The mean correlation in a meta-analysis of vertebrate predators of invertebrate prey (22 cases) is significantly positive, showing that these groups tend to impose spatially density-dependent depletion. In contrast, reviews of invertebrate parasitoids find that inverse and positive density dependence are equally common. This difference may result partly from greater mobility of vertebrates, allowing them to sample the environment and distribute themselves closer to a rate-maximizing optimum. It is also possible that studies of vertebrates measure depletion at scales appropriate to the aggregative response of the consumers more frequently than studies of invertebrates.","UNIV E ANGLIA, SCH BIOL SCI, NORWICH NR4 7TJ, NORFOLK, ENGLAND","Dolman, PM (corresponding author), UNIV E ANGLIA, SCH ENVIRONM SCI, NORWICH NR4 7TJ, NORFOLK, ENGLAND.",,"Sutherland, William/B-1291-2013; Dolman, Paul M./AAK-3914-2020","Dolman, Paul/0000-0002-9340-2791; Sutherland, William/0000-0002-6498-0437",,,,88,27,28,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Even spatially explicit differential equation models typically make a local mean-field assumption. In effect, the assumption is that diffusive movement is strong enough to destroy spatial structure or that interactions between individuals are sufficiently long-range that the effects of spatial structure are weak. However, many important biophysical processes, such as chemical reactions of biomolecules within cells, disease transmission among humans, and dispersal of plants, have characteristic spatial scales that can generate strong spatial structure at the scale of individuals, with important effects on the behaviour of biological systems. This calls for mathematical methods that incorporate spatial structure. Here, we focus on one method, spatial-moment dynamics, which is based on the idea that important information about a spatial point process is held in its low-order spatial moments. The method goes beyond the dynamics of the first moment, i.e. the mean density or concentration of agents in space, in which no information about spatial structure is retained. By including the dynamics of at least the second moment, the method retains some information about spatial structure. Whereas mean-field models effectively use a closure assumption for the second moment, spatial-moment models use a closure assumption for the third (or a higher-order) moment. The aim of the paper was to provide a parsimonious and intuitive derivation of spatial-moment dynamic equations that is accessible to non-specialists. The derivation builds naturally from the first moment to the second, and we show how it can be extended to higher-order moments. Rather than tying the model to a specific biological example, we formulate a general model of movement, birth, and death of multiple types of interacting agents. This model can be applied to problems from a range of disciplines, some of which we discuss. The derivation is performed in a spatially non-homogeneous setting, to facilitate future investigations of biological scenarios, such as invasions, in which the spatial patterns are non-stationary over space.","[Plank, Michael J.] Univ Canterbury, Dept Math & Stat, Christchurch 1, New Zealand; [Law, Richard] Univ York, York Ctr Complex Syst Anal, Ron Cooke Hub, York YO10 5GE, N Yorkshire, England","Plank, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Dept Math & Stat, Christchurch 1, New Zealand.",michael.plank@canterbury.ac.nz; richard.law@york.ac.uk,"Plank, Michael John/H-8030-2019","Plank, Michael John/0000-0002-7539-3465",RSNZ Marsden FundRoyal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ) [11-UOC-005],"This work owes its origin to unpublished ideas of Dr. David Grey (University of Sheffield), and we are very grateful to him for his interest in the research area and for sharing his ideas.

Studies from various tropical locations report losses of forest birds as possibly direct or indirect results of deforestation. Although it may take a century for all the sensitive species to be extirpated from a site following habitat loss, species with larger or heavier bodies and those foraging on insects, fruits, or both are particularly extinction prone. Larger- or heavier-bodied species may occur at low densities, increasing their vulnerability to habitat alterations. Insectivores are vulnerable for reasons such as the loss of preferred microhabitats, poor dispersal abilities, and/or ground nesting habits that make them susceptible to predation. The lack of year-round availability of fruits may make survival in deforested or fragmented areas difficult for frugivores. Extirpation of large predators, superior competitors, pollinators, and seed dispersers may have repercussions for tropical ecosystem functioning. Large tropical reserves that adequately protect existing forest avifauna are needed. Sound ecological knowledge of tropical forest avifauna for biodiversity-friendly forest management practices is also needed but sorely lacking.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Sci Biol, Singapore 117543, Singapore; Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Biol Labs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Sodhi, NS (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Sci Biol, Singapore 117543, Singapore.",dbsns@nus.edu.sg; lhliow@midway.uchicago.edu; jbazzaz@oeb.harvard.edu,"Liow, Lee Hsiang/E-3481-2010","Liow, Lee Hsiang/0000-0002-3732-6069",,,,138,182,191,1,98,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",1543-592X,1545-2069,,ANNU REV ECOL EVOL S,Annu.

We first assess the direct epidemiological consequences of supplementation, highlighting the similarities and differences between food provisioning and two widespread forms of nutrient input: agricultural fertilization and aquatic nutrient enrichment. We then review an aquatic disease system and a general model to assess whether predator and competitor species can enhance or overturn the direct effects of enrichment. All forms of supplementation can directly affect epidemics by increasing host population size or altering parasite production within hosts, but food provisioning is most likely to aggregate hosts and increase parasite transmission. However, if predators or competitors increase in response to supplementation, they could alter resource-fuelled outbreaks in focal hosts. We recommend identifying the traits of hosts, parasites or interacting species that best predict epidemiological responses to supplementation and evaluating the relative importance of these direct and indirect mechanisms. Theory and experiments should examine the timing of behavioural, physiological and demographic changes for realistic, variable scenarios of supplementation. A more integrative view of resource supplementation and wildlife disease could yield broadly applicable disease management strategies.

The indirect effects of predators on lower trophic levels have been studied without much attention to phenotypically plastic traits of key food web components. Phenotypic plasticity among species creates phenotypic diversity over a changing environmental landscape. 2. We measured the indirect effects of planktivorous larval walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) on phytoplankton biomass through their effects on the dominant herbivore species, Daphnia pulicaria and D. mendotae. 3. Fish had no effect on phytoplankton biomass or overall Daphnia density. We observed a compensatory response to predation by functionally comparable species within a trophic level in the form of shifting dominance and coexistence of Daphnia species. We hypothesized that this phenotypically plastic response to predation decoupled a potential trophic cascade in this freshwater pelagic system. Daphnia pulicaria density decreased over time with fish predation, but D. mendotae density increased over time with fish predation. 4. Phenotypically plastic life history trait shifts and reproductive rates differed between species in fishless and fish enclosures, accounting for population trends. Daphnia pulicaria were also proportionally higher in walleye larvae stomachs than in the enclosures, indicating that walleye preferred to feed on D. pulcaria over D. mendotae. The resultant shift in dominance may partially explain the overall benign effect of fish on grazers and supports the hypothesis that trophic level diversity can decouple a trophic cascade.","Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Bernot, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",bernot.1@nd.edu,,"Dodds, Walter/0000-0002-6666-8930",,,,64,6,7,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

We tested the influences of population size, climate, calf weight and sex on survival to 6 months of age of 1241 radio-collared caribou calves over three decades, spanning periods of population growth (1979-1997) and decline (2003-2012) in Newfoundland, Canada. Daily survival rates were higher and rose more quickly with calf age during the population growth period compared to the decline. Population size (negatively) and calf weight (positively) affected survival during the decline but neither had a detectable influence during the growth phase. Sex, climate and plant productivity (the latter two derived from the North Atlantic Oscillation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, respectively) exerted minimal influence during either phase. Predation was the dominant source of mortality. The mean percentage of calves killed by predators was 30 % higher during the decline compared to the growth phase. Black bears (Ursus americanus) and lynx (Lynx canadensis) were the major predators during the population increase but this changed during the decrease to black bears and coyotes (Canis latrans). Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that Newfoundland caribou experienced phase-dependent survival mediated proximally by predation and competition for food.","[Mahoney, Shane P.] Conservat Vis Inc, St John, NF A1C 5W4, Canada; [Lewis, Keith P.; Weir, Jackie N.] Govt Newfoundland & Labrador, Dept Environm & Conservat, Sustainable Dev & Strateg Sci, St John, NF A1B 4J6, Canada; [Morrison, Shawn F.] Dryas Res Ltd, Edmonton, AB T6C 2R6, Canada; [Luther, J.

Here we discuss strengths and shortcomings of the parasite-as-predator analogy and its potential to provide new insights into both fields. Developments in predator-prey ecology, such as temporal risk allocation and associational resistance, can drive new hypotheses for parasite-host systems. Concepts developed in parasite-host ecology, such as threshold host densities and phylodynamics, might provide new ideas for predator-prey ecology. Topics such as trait-mediated indirect effects and enemy-mediated facilitation provide opportunities for the two fields to work together. We suggest that greater unification of predator-prey and parasite-host ecology would foster advances in both fields.","[Raffel, Thomas R.; Martin, Lynn B.; Rohr, Jason R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Raffel, TR (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Biol, 4202 E Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",traffel@cas.usf.edu,"Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021; Martin, Lynn/C-2037-2009","Martin, Lynn/0000-0002-5887-4937",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0516227]; US Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NRI 2006-01370],We thank Bob Holt and an anonymous reviewer for helpful comments.

To investigate possible causes for the species long-term decline, we examined habitat selection by Marsh Tits at three scales. For individual foraging birds, winter time budgets and foraging behaviour, recorded using instantaneous sampling, differed little between Marsh and Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus, but Marsh Tits spent more time in the understorey and more time lower down in both the woodland canopy and the understorey. At the scale of breeding territories, the characteristics (numbers by size class, vegetation density, species richness) of trees and shrubs were compared using 100 x 10-m sample transects of ten territories in each of four woods. The characteristics of the trees differed significantly between woods whilst those of the shrubs did not, suggesting that the characteristics of shrubs were more important in territory selection by Marsh Tits than were those of trees. Furthermore, in one of the four woods (Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire), Marsh Tits were largely absent from areas with dense tree canopy, but poor shrub cover. On a national scale, using data from 157 of the woodlands surveyed by the RSPB/BTO Repeat Woodland Bird Survey, Marsh Tit abundance in 2003/04 was found to be positively related to vegetation cover at heights corresponding to the shrub layer, especially at 2-4 m. These relationships were not apparent in data for the same woods for the 1980s, but shrub cover had increased substantially by 2003/04 and Marsh Tit abundance had increased in woods with the most cover in 2003/04. Thus, factors damaging the shrub layer, such as overgrazing by deer, shading out by canopy closure and managed clearance of shrub cover, may reduce the suitability of woodland for Marsh Tits. Habitat use by a closely related species, Willow Tit Poecile montanus, is also discussed.","Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Huntingdon PE28 2LS, England; Univ Oxford, Edward Greu Inst Field Ornithol, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; Royal Soc Protect Birds, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, England; British Trust Ornithol, Norfolk IP24 2PU, England","Hinsley, SA (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Monks Wood, Abbots Ripton, Huntingdon PE28 2LS, England.",sahi@ceh.ac.uk,"Broughton, Richard/AAE-5912-2020; Hinsley, Shelley A/E-6790-2012; Amar, Arjun/L-4493-2019; Carpenter, Jane/AAO-4538-2020; Arjun, Amar/F-3815-2011","Carpenter, Jane/0000-0002-7846-2489; Arjun, Amar/0000-0002-7405-1180; Broughton, Richard/0000-0002-6838-9628; Bellamy, Paul/0000-0003-2234-2119",Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [CEH010021] Funding Source: researchfish,,,42,20,21,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0019-1019,1474-919X,,IBIS,Ibis,NOV,2007,149,,,2,,,224,233,,10.1111/j.1474-919X.2007.00691.x,,,10,Ornithology,Zoology,235OF,WOS:000251243500020,,"Green Accepted, Bronze",,,2021-09-27,

We examine the hypothesis that the presence of these large carnivores has affected fisheries resources, either through direct predation on larval stages, or through competition for zooplankton prey, In this paper, we explore the impact of this jellyfish increase on zooplankton and fish communities based on field data on the composition of the jellyfish community, and the abundance, size, stable isotopic signatures, and feeding habits of the principal scyphomedusae in the region. These data, together with those on zooplankton biomass, are used to estimate the ecosystem impacts of this increase. The center of jellyfish biomass has shifted from the SE Middle Shelf Domain in the early 1980s to the NW in the late 1990s. In recent years, the species composition of large medusae caught in trawls was dominated (>80% by number and >95% by weight) by the scyphozoan Chrysaora melanaster, Dense aggregations of this species occupied the water column in daytime between 10 and 40 in. Their food habits consisted mainly of pelagic crustaceans (euphausiids, copepods, amphipods), although other jellyfish and juvenile pollock were also consumed, Based on stable isotope ratios, the trophic level of this scyphozoan is equivalent to, or higher than, that of Age 0 pollock. Preliminary estimates showed that medusae have a moderate grazing impact on zooplankton in the area around the Pribilof Islands; C, melanaster was estimated on average to consume seasonally about one-third of the standing stock and 4.7% of the annual production of zooplankton in this region, Daily consumption of Age 0 pollock was estimated to be 2.8% of the standing stock around the Pribilof Islands during 1999. A hypothesis for the increase in jellyfishes observed in the eastern Bering Sea, based on release from competition from planktivorous forage fishes, is proposed.","Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Newport, OR 97365 USA; Tohoku Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Tagajo, Miyagi 985, Japan; Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Brodeur, RD (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Newport, OR 97365 USA.",rick.brodeur@noaa.gov,"Hunt, George/V-9423-2019","Brodeur, Richard/0000-0002-6629-5564; Hunt, George/0000-0001-8709-2697",,,,69,236,264,3,107,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

We used a two-factor experimental design to investigate how multispecies benthic assemblages in southern California kelp forests respond to OA and grazing by the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Settlement tiles accrued natural mixed assemblages of algae and invertebrates in a kelp forest off San Diego, CA for one year before being exposed to OA and grazing in a laboratory experiment for two months. Space occupying organisms were identified and pooled into six functional groups: calcified invertebrates, non-calcified invertebrates, calcified algae, fleshy algae, sediment, and bare space for subsequent analyses of community structure. Interestingly, communities that developed on separate tile racks were unique, despite being deployed close in space, and further changes in community structure in response to OA and grazing depended on this initial community state. On Rack 1, we found significant effects of both pCO(2) and grazing with elevated pCO(2) increasing cover of fleshy algae, but sea urchin grazers decreasing cover of fleshy algae. On Rack 2, we found a similar to 35% higher percent cover of sediment on tiles reared in ambient pCO(2) but observed similar to 27% higher cover of bare space in the high pCO(2) conditions. On Rack 3, we found an average of 45% lower percent cover of calcified sessile invertebrates at ambient pCO(2) than in high pCO(2) treatments on Rack 3. Net community calcification was 137% lower in elevated pCO(2) treatments. Kelp sporophyte densities on tiles without urchins were 74% higher than on tiles with urchins and kelp densities were highest in the elevated pCO(2) treatment. Urchin growth and grazing rates were 49% and 126% higher under ambient than high pCO(2) conditions. This study highlights consistent negative impacts of OA on community processes such as calcification and grazing rates, even though impacts on community structure were highly context-dependent.","[Donham, Emily M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Donham, Emily M.; Hamilton, Scott L.] San Jose State Univ, Moss Landing Marine Labs, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Price, Nichole N.] Bigelow Lab Ocean Sci, East Boothbay, ME 04544 USA; [Kram, Susan; Smith, Jennifer] Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Kelly, Emily] Stanford Univ, Ctr Ocean Solut, Palo Alto, CA 94305 USA; [Johnson, Maggie D.] Smithsonian Marine State Ft Pierce, Ft Pierce, FL 34949 USA; [Neu, Alexander T.] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Donham, EM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",edonham@ucsc.edu,,,"CSU COAST; Dr. Earl and Ethyl Myers Oceanographic and Marine Biology Trust; NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA10OAR4170060]; California Sea Grant College Program Project through NOAA'S National Sea Grant College Program, U.S. Dept. of Commerce [R/CC-05]","We thank Isabella Doohan, Jeremiah Ets-Hokin, Evie Fachon, Matt Metzger, Garrett Stewart, Dr. Yuichiro Takeshita and Phil Zerofski for their help collecting specimens and maintaining laboratory experiments and Dr. Pete Raimondi for help with statistical analyses.

We examined temporal variation in fish community abundance in a headwater tributary of a large river in the upper South Island (New Zealand) over 10 years. We were interested in the influence of natural flow variation and temperature on native fish abundance within the context of potential competition/predation pressure from juvenile introduced trout. Results from biannual sampling highlighted the dominating influence of floods on fish population dynamics, overriding biotic effects. We found no evidence for adverse effects of trout on native fish, and flow-related habitat performed more poorly in explaining variation in fish abundance than low- and median-flow statistics. Differences in temporal variation in abundance between species were largely consistent with life histories that provide resistance and (or) resilience to flood flows and relative insensitivity to low flows. Long-term data (>= 10 years) are needed for detecting meaningful trends and quantifying the effects of human activities on fish community abundance.","[Hayes, John W.; Goodwin, Eric O.; Clapcott, Joanne E.; Shearer, Karen A.] Cawthron Inst, Private Bag 2, Nelson 7042, New Zealand","Hayes, JW (corresponding author), Cawthron Inst, Private Bag 2, Nelson 7042, New Zealand.",john.hayes@cawthron.org.nz,,,"New Zealand Ministry for Business, Innovation and EmploymentNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) [CAWX0208, C01X0308]; National Institute of Water and Atmosphere's Core [C01X1004]; Fish and Game New Zealand; Cawthron Institute","We thank the following for assistance with field work: staff from the Nelson-Marlborough Fish and Game Council, Cawthron Institute, Tasman District Council and the Department of Conservation, and Nelson Anglers Club members and Nicholas F.

Reptiles are often neglected in island systems, principally the ones inhabiting remote areas, therefore little is known on their ecological networks. The Selvagens gecko Tarentola (boettgeri) bischoffi, endemic to the remote and integral reserve of Selvagens Archipelago, is classified as Vulnerable by the Portuguese Red Data Book. Little is known about this gecko's ecology and dietary habits, but it is assumed to be exclusively insectivorous. The diet of the continental Tarentola species was already studied using classical methods. Only two studies have used next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques for this genus thus far, and very few NGS studies have been employed for reptiles in general. Considering the lack of information on its diet and the conservation interest of the Selvagens gecko, we used morphological and DNA metabarcoding approaches to characterize its diet. The traditional method of morphological identification of prey remains in faecal pellets collected over a longer period was compared with metabarcoding of samples collected during rapid surveys. Molecular results revealed that this species is a generalist, feeding on invertebrate, plant and vertebrate items, whereas the morphological approaches were unable to detect the latter two. These results opened up new questions on the ecological role of the Selvagens gecko that deserves to be further explored, such as the possible predation on seabirds, plant services or trophic competition with the sympatric Madeira lizard Teira dugesii. Metabarcoding identified a greater diversity of dietary items at higher taxonomic resolution, but morphological identification enabled calculation of relative abundances and biomasses of ingested arthropods, and detected a dietary shift on invertebrate preys between seasons. Results of this study highlight the global applicability of rapid metabarcoding surveys for understudied taxa on remote islands that are difficult to access. We recommend using the metabarcoding approach, even if 'speedy' sampling only is possible, but we must highlight that disregarding long-term ecological data may lead to 'hasty' conclusion.","[Gil, Vanessa; Aguiar, Carlos A.

Its spatial distribution and food preferences were evaluated between February and May 2007, both in shaded (with tree cover) and sunny (open) cattle pastures in the Pescador and El Palmar regions of southwestern Colombia. Two sunny and two shaded cattle pasture plots were selected at each region. Twenty consecutive, equilateral 25 m(2) parcels were established at each plot. Nest locations were found by following trails from 20 equidistant tuna baits per parcel. The procedure was repeated during the wet and dry seasons with a total of 16 plot records. For determining food preferences, a paper disk providing five live ticks, five honey droplets and five Passiflora ligularis seeds was placed 30 cm away from the nest entrance, at one nest for each of 15 parcels per plot. Nest distribution was aggregated in shaded pastures, with an average nest density of 568 nests/ha, whereas it was mainly random in sunny pastures, with an average nest density of 1945 nests/ha. Whatever the season, E. ruidum nested preferentially in open places in both regions, apparently avoiding soil surfaces under the tree canopy cover in shaded pastures. This could explain the aggregated pattern recorded in these pastures despite solve intraspecific competition. Foragers demonstrated a high capacity as seed dispersers, the myrmecochoric P. ligularis seeds representing 74.7% of the total weight of all food items removed. Comparatively, they were significantly less attracted by honey and ticks which were retrieved in similar quantities (14.3% and 11.0% of the total weight removed, respectively). In the course of this study, individual workers were observed carrying in their mandibles wild, natural ticks, captured in the field. This is the first report of ants naturally preying on ticks in Colombia. Our data confirm the status of E. ruidum as an important natural biocontrol agent which could be properly managed for ecological services in Neotropical agroecosystems.","[Santamaria, Carlos; Armbrecht, Inge] Univ Valle, Dept Biol, Cali, Colombia; [Lachaud, Jean-Paul] Univ Toulouse 3, Ctr Rech Cognit Anim, CNRS, UMR 5169, F-31062 Toulouse 09, France; [Lachaud, Jean-Paul] Colegio Frontera Sur, Dpto Entomol Trop, Chiapas 30700, Mexico","Armbrecht, I (corresponding author), Univ Valle, Dept Biol, Calle 13 100-00, Cali, Colombia.",inge@univalle.edu.co,"Lachaud, Jean-Paul/H-4266-2019; Trejo, Yesenia YGTA/D-9257-2012",,"ColcienciasDepartamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias [1106-07-17808]","We are grateful to C.

Here we examine the phylogeographic and phenotypic patterns of diversity within Percichthys trucha, a widely distributed Patagonian fish species complex that inhabits Andean and steppe freshwater environments. Molecular analysis (mtDNA control region) of 21 populations distributed throughout its latitudinal range revealed little evidence of phylogeographic structure and no evidence of species-level genetic divergence east of the Andes. The complex, however, exhibits high levels of intra-and interpopulation phenotypic variation. Patterns of among-population divergence in morphology were most easily explained by differences in predation pressure among populations; dorsal fin spines (commonly a defensive characteristic) were longer in environments with greater densities of potentially piscivorous fish. Trophic characters were highly variable within populations, suggesting an important role for resources in generating within-population morphological variation. The very shallow levels of divergence shown by the molecular data most likely reflect the historical mixing of populations as a result of the climatic and landscape changes that affected Patagonia throughout the Quaternary. The phenotypic divergences, in contrast, are probably the result of differing contemporary selection regimes acting on currently disjoint populations.

Although territory ownership is already known to contribute importantly to male reproductive success and the ecological coexistence of African rock-dwelling cichlids, the significance of variation in territory features has received little attention in these fishes. In Lake Malawi, males of Pseudotropheus tropheops orange chest defend territories on either of two substrate classes at Harbour Island: flat rock slabs lacking crevices and caves, or structurally complex boulder fields containing cave shelters. Focal watches of this species demonstrated that both territory size and occupancy on either substrate type depend on the size of male residents. Males larger than a threshold size exclusively held the largest and most structurally complex territories. After removal of conspecific residents, more vacant territorial areas on cave-containing substrate were reoccupied by orange chest males in full breeding coloration compared to vacant areas on flat substrate. These findings suggest competition among orange chest males for complex rocky substrate. Defense of caves was associated with enhanced male courtship rates: the number of caves within a male's territory was a better predictor of courtship activity than was male size or territory area. In addition to territories being crucial for male reproductive success and therefore likely playing a role in sexual selection, male-male competition for caves in rock-dwelling cichlids may be promoted by the ecological advantage of enemy-free space. Smaller orange chest males lacking caves tended to move into adjacent boulder fields in the presence of predators, particularly at night. In contrast, males defending caves were more likely to remain on their territories when nocturnal predators were present. The territorial behaviors of P. tropheops orange chest that we observed in situ provide an instructive natural framework for testing the roles of substrate and ecology in the mating systems of rock-dwelling cichlid fishes.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; US EPA, Atlantic Ecol Div, Populat Ecol Branch, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA","Arnegard, ME (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",markert@fastmail.fm; arnegard@zoology.ubc.ca,,,,,,63,15,16,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,2007,154,3,,,,,611,621,,10.1007/s00442-007-0853-5,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,234FU,WOS:000251146900017,17885765,,,,2021-09-27,

We quantified the diet of autumn-migrant mergansers and walleye during 1998-2000 in Sandusky Bay and adjacent waters of western Lake Erie. We hypothesized that the diets of both predators would be similar in species composition, but because of different foraging ecologies their diets would differ markedly in size of prey consumed. In addition to predator samples, we used trawl data from the same general area as an index of prey availability. We found that mergansers fed almost exclusively on fish (nine species). Gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), emerald shiner (Notrapis atherinoides) and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) were consumed in the greatest numbers, most frequently and comprised the greatest biomass. Walleye fed exclusively on fish: gizzard shad, alewife (Alosa psuedoharengus) and emerald shiner were consumed in the greatest numbers, most frequently and comprised the greatest biomass. Diet overlap between mergansers and walleye was 67% by weight and 66% by species frequency. Mean total lengths of gizzard shad, emerald shiner and round goby found in walleye stomachs exceeded those captured in trawls by 47%, on average. Mean total lengths of gizzard shad, emerald shiner and round goby were greater in walleye stomachs than in merganser stomachs. Mean total lengths of emerald shiner and round goby were less in merganser stomachs than in trawls. Our results suggest that although the diets of walleye and mergansers overlapped considerably, mergansers generally consumed smaller fish than walleye. Given the abundance and diversity of prey species available, and the transient nature of mergansers on Lake Eric during migration, we conclude that competition for food between these species is minimal.","[Bur, Michael T.; Stapanian, Martin A.] Great Lakes Sci Ctr, US Geol Survey, Sandusky, OH 44870 USA; [Bernhardt, Glen] Wildlife Serv, USDA, Sandusky, OH 44870 USA; [Turner, Mark W.] Ohio Dept Nat Resources, Sandusky Fisheries Res Unit, Sandusky, OH 44870 USA","Bur, MT (corresponding author), Great Lakes Sci Ctr, US Geol Survey, Lake Erie Biol Stn,6100 Columbus Ave, Sandusky, OH 44870 USA.",mbur@usgs.gov,,"Stapanian, Martin/0000-0001-8173-4273",,,,44,17,17,0,25,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0003-0031,,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

Maternity roosts of insectivorous bats (where females raise young) are critical to the conservation of threatened species as roost quality can influence reproductive success. Additionally, threatened species may have specialised requirements or unusual behaviour, which may be overlooked without targeted investigation. Aims. To explore which factors influence the roost selection of Mormopterus norfolkensis, by comparing day roosts, identified via radio-tracking, with environmental variables collected at tree, patch and landscape scales. Methods. We collected a range of variables describing maternity roosts and surrounding patches, including internal measurements of hollows and microclimate. Additionally, we derived landscape-scale variables using a geographic information system. We then explored which variables best explained roost occurrence using logistic regression. Key results. Nineteen lactating females and two male M. norfolkensis were tracked to 40 roost trees, mostly grey mangrove, Avicennia marina subsp. australasica. Lactating females were found to be faithful to two patches of mangrove forest close to where they were captured, regularly switched roosts and roosted in hollows singularly or in small groups. The attributes of mangrove patches, especially a high proportion of hollows, better predicted roosting by lactating females than roost-tree or landscape characteristics. Additionally, although the microclimate of roost hollows was not significantly different from ambient mangrove conditions, the mangrove forest was slightly more stable and had higher humidity than did other nearby habitats. Conclusions. Contrary to predictions, maternity roosting group sizes were relatively small, indicating that bats were not deriving thermoregulatory benefits from communal living. However, we suggest that lactating females may benefit from the operation of a fission-fusion society among the colony as a whole. Additionally, the mature mangrove forest could offer unique roosting opportunities for bats because they support high densities of hollow-bearing trees, a stable microclimate and potentially low abundances of predators and competitors. Implications. This is one of few international bat-mangrove studies and it illustrates that threatened species can behave unexpectedly and may be overlooked in conservation strategies that are based largely on anecdotal observations. We encourage further research into the value of mangrove forests to terrestrial fauna globally.","[McConville, Anna; Mahony, Michael J.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Fac Sci & Informat Technol, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Law, Bradley S.] Forest Sci Ctr, Dept Primary Ind, Beecroft, NSW 2119, Australia","McConville, A (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Fac Sci & Informat Technol, Univ Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",anna.mcconville@uon.edu.au,,"Law, Bradley/0000-0002-3991-3865",Tom Farrell Institute for the Environment; Donaldson Conservation Trust; Hunter-Central Rivers Catchment Management Authority; Royal Zoological Society of NSW; Wambo Coal Pty Ltd; Australian Geographic Society,"We thank the numerous volunteers who assisted with field work and land managers that provided property access for this project.

In a consumer-exclusion experiment spanning twenty degrees of latitude along the east Australian coast, the magnitude of consumer effects on sub-tidal sessile assemblage composition was not greater at low than high latitudes. Across caged and control assemblages, Shannon's diversity, Pielou's evenness, and richness of functional groups decreased with increasing latitude, but the magnitude of consumer effects on these metrics did not display consistent latitudinal gradients. Instead, latitudinal gradients in consumer effects were apparent for individual functional groups. Solitary ascidians displayed the pattern consistent with predictions of greater direct effects of predators at low than high latitude. As consumers reduced the biomass of this and other competitive dominants, groups less prone to predation (e.g., hydroids, various groups of bryozoans) were able to take advantage of freed space in the presence of consumers and show increased abundances there. This large-scale empirical study demonstrates the complexity of species interactions, and the failure of assemblage-level metrics to adequately capture consumer effects over large spatial gradients.","[Lavender, James T.; Dafforn, Katherine A.; Johnston, Emma L.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Dafforn, Katherine A.; Bishop, Melanie J.; Johnston, Emma L.] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW, Australia; [Bishop, Melanie J.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Lavender, JT (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",jlavender10@gmail.com,"Johnston, Emma/B-7210-2009; Dafforn, Katherine/J-9647-2013","Johnston, Emma/0000-0002-2117-366X; Bishop, Melanie/0000-0001-8210-6500; Dafforn, Katherine/0000-0001-8848-377X",Australian Research Council Linkage ProjectAustralian Research Council [LP140100753]; University of New South Wales; Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government,"The authors wish to thank the managers of the various marinas used in this study.

Owing to the lack of specificity of many arthropods, spontaneous plants may be attacked by the same arthropods that attack cultivated plants and they may also harbor natural enemies of organisms harmful to cultivated plants. Aceodromus convolvuli Muma (Blattisociidae) has been reported recently in relatively large numbers in Tocantins state, central Brazil, mostly on Helicteres guazumifolia Kunth (Malvaceae). Very little has been reported about the population dynamics of blattisociid mites under field conditions. The objective of this work was to study the population dynamics of A. convolvuli in Gurupi, Tocantins state, to evaluate its possible interaction with associated mites. Monthly samples were taken from leaves of the 11 most abundant and frequent spontaneous plants in a Jatropha curcas L. (Euphorbiaceae) plantation. About 96.5 % of the specimens of A. convolvuli were collected in the rainy season. The patterns of variation of the population of A. convolvuli and of predators belonging to the family Phytoseiidae were similar, but A. convolvuli was much more numerous than all phytoseiid specimens combined. Highly significant correlations were observed between A. convolvuli densities and relative humidity or diversity of spontaneous plants. When only mites on H. guazumifolia were considered, highly significant correlation was also observed between densities of A. convolvuli and of mites of the family Tetranychidae. The results suggested that A. convolvuli could be a predator of tenuipalpid and/or tetranychid mites. Studies about its biology are needed to determine its preferred food sources and potential as biological control agent.","[Cruz, Wilton P.; Sarmento, Renato A.; Pedro-Neto, Marcal] UFT, Gurupi, State Of Tocant, Brazil; [Cruz, Wilton P.; de Moraes, Gilberto J.] Univ Estadual Paulista, UNESP, Programa Posgrad Entomol Agr, Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil; [Teodoro, Adenir V.] Embrapa Tabuleiros Costeiros, Aracaju, State Of Sergip, Brazil; [Rodrigues, Diego M.] Univ Fed Para UFPA, Dept Ciencias Agr, Maraba, Para, Brazil; [de Moraes, Gilberto J.] Univ Sao Paulo ESALQ USP, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Dept Entomol & Acarol, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil","Sarmento, RA (corresponding author), UFT, POB 66, Gurupi, State Of Tocant, Brazil.",rsarmento@uft.edu.br,"Teodoro, Adenir/AAY-1190-2021; de Moraes, Gilberto J./H-9849-2012","de Moraes, Gilberto J./0000-0002-5587-1781; Sarmento, Renato/0000-0002-5379-9595","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [620028/2008-4, 475408/2008-0]; Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel CAPES-BrazilCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)","The authors thank the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) for financial support (Projects 620028/2008-4 and 475408/2008-0) and Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel CAPES-Brazil for providing scholarships to the first and third authors (Projects: PROCAD-NF and CAPES-PNPD).

Identifying preferred physical characteristics (e.g., topography, vegetation structure) can inform managers to improve nesting habitat suitability. However, social factors (e.g., attraction, territoriality, competition) can complicate understanding physical characteristics preferred by nesting birds. We simultaneously evaluated the physical characteristics and social factors influencing selection of island nest sites by colonial-nesting American avocets (Recurvirostra americana) and Forster's terns (Sterna forsteri) at 2 spatial scales in San Francisco Bay, 2011-2012. At the larger island plot (1m(2)) scale, we used real-time kinematics to produce detailed topographies of nesting islands and map the distribution of nests. Nesting probability was greatest in island plots between 0.5m and 1.5m above the water surface, at distances <10m from the water's edge, and of moderately steep (avocets) or flat (terns) slopes. Further, avocet and tern nesting probability increased as the number of nests initiated in adjacent plots increased up to a peak of 11-12 tern nests, and then decreased thereafter. Yet, avocets were less likely to nest in plots adjacent to plots with nesting avocets, suggesting an influence of intra-specific territoriality. At the smaller microhabitat scale, or the area immediately surrounding the nest, we compared topography, vegetation, and distance to nearest nest between nest sites and paired random sites. Topography had little influence on selection of the nest microhabitat. Instead, nest sites were more likely to have vegetation present, and greater cover, than random sites. Finally, avocet, and to a lesser extent tern, nest sites were closer to other active conspecific or heterospecific nests than random sites, indicating that social attraction played a role in selection of nest microhabitat. Our results demonstrate key differences in nest-site selection between co-occurring avocets and terns, and indicate the effects of physical characteristics and social factors on selection of nesting habitat are dependent on the spatial scale examined. Moreover, these results indicate that islands with abundant area between 0.5m and 1.5m above the water surface, within 10m of the water's edge, and containing a mosaic of slopes ranging from flat to moderately steep would provide preferred nesting habitat for avocets and terns.

We tested this hypothesis by manipulating the density of two common lake predators, the small-sized fish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco (the intraguild predator) and the shrimp Exopalaemon modestus (the intraguild prey), in outdoor mesocosms containing natural phytoplankton and zooplankton communities. In single predator treatments, both predators induced a strong trophic cascade, as evidenced by extinction of the key herbivore, Daphnia pulex, and increasing phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a concentration. When the two predators were added together, however, the strength of collective predator effects on zooplankton and the cascading effects on phytoplankton growth were weaker than the sum of the individual predator effects. We attributed this antagonism among predators to intraguild predation as demonstrated by the lower shrimp catch per unit effort in the presence of fish. Our study suggests that common predators in subtropical shallow lakes may act antagonistically and thereby dampen trophic cascades in food webs. Thus, when implementing biomanipulation efforts to suppress algal growth via enhancing zooplankton herbivory, both the quantity and diversity of lake predator assemblies should be considered.","[He, Hu; Chen, Kunquan; Li, Qisheng; Li, Kuanyi; Liu, Zhengwen] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Ning, Xiaoyu] Chuzhou Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Chuzhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Qisheng] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Shanghai Engn Res Ctr Aquaculture, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Kuanyi; Liu, Zhengwen; Jeppesen, Erik] Sino Danish Ctr Educ & Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhengwen] Jinan Univ, Dept Ecol, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhengwen] Jinan Univ, Inst Hydrobiol, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Jeppesen, Erik] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Silkeborg, Denmark; [Jeppesen, Erik] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Limnol Lab, Ankara, Turkey; [Jeppesen, Erik] Middle East Tech Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Res & Implementat, Ankara, Turkey; [Jeppesen, Erik] Middle East Tech Univ, Inst Marine Sci, Mersin, Turkey","He, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",hehu@niglas.ac.cn,"Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012","Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X","National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31930074, 31971473]; Chinese National Key Research and Development Project [2017YFA0605201]; One-Three-Five Strategic Planning of Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences [NIGLAS2017GH01, NIGLAS2018GH04]; AnaEE Denmark; AQUACOSM; Tubitak program BIDEB 2232Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK) [118C250]","National Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31930074 and 31971473; Chinese National Key Research and Development Project, Grant/Award Number: 2017YFA0605201; One-Three-Five Strategic Planning of Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: NIGLAS2017GH01 and NIGLAS2018GH04; AQUACOSM; AnaEE Denmark; Tubitak program BIDEB 2232, Grant/Award Number: 118C250",,55,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

But landscapes of fear are complex and dynamic, such as temperate deciduous forests characterized by intermittent, synchronized production of large seed crops (mast peaks). These resource pulses elevate the magnitude of predation risk via direct or indirect effects, possibly altering also predator avoidance strategies of a prey. Yet, how animals manage predation risk via informed habitat selection and how this depends on ecological context remains poorly explored. We studied risk-sensitive settlement behavior of wood warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix. We tested the hypothesis that warblers flexibly avoid predators (Eurasian jays Garrulus glandarius) during habitat selection but that their interactions are mediated by mast seeding, which is known to elevate the overall nest predation risk for warblers through its cascading effects on population dynamics of rodents and generalist predators. We used a playback experiment to manipulate warblers' perceived risk of nest predation by jays. We replicated the experiment in two consecutive years, followed by high or low seed crop. In the spring following mast trough, risky jay plots featured low abundance, late settlement, and poor pairing success compared to other treatments. In contrast, no response differences were found in the spring following mast seeding. Our results suggest that the way wood warblers adjust habitat choices to jay predation risk is indirectly mediated by mast seeding. This highlights plasticity in predator avoidance during prey habitat selection in complex and dynamic landscapes of fear, and the potential effects of mast seeding on animal behavior via indirect interactions.Significance statementAvoiding places with high nest predation risk during settlement decisions is believed to be widespread in birds. However, the mechanistic understanding of how birds acquire and use information about ambient nest predation risk to fine-tune settlement decisions is still limited. Using a playback experiment, we show that wood warblers eavesdrop on predator calls and avoid settling at sites with high perceived risk of nest predation by Eurasian jays. However, the way warblers adjust habitat choices to the nest predation risk posed by jays appears to be affected by tree mast seeding. This is potentially due to cascading effects of masting on the population dynamics of rodents and generalist predators, creating temporal peaks of elevated nest predation risk for wood warblers. Our study highlights plasticity in predator avoidance during prey settlement behavior in temporally variable, pulsed-resources ecosystems.","[Szymkowiak, Jakub] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Environm Biol, Populat Ecol Lab, Fac Biol, Umultowska 89, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland; [Thomson, Robert L.] Univ Cape Town, FitzPatrick Inst African Ornithol, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa","Szymkowiak, J (corresponding author), Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Environm Biol, Populat Ecol Lab, Fac Biol, Umultowska 89, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland.",jszym@amu.edu.pl,"Szymkowiak, Jakub/D-6669-2016; Thomson, Robert L/B-9637-2012","Szymkowiak, Jakub/0000-0002-4595-1876; Thomson, Robert L/0000-0002-6958-1259","National Science Centre in PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [2012/07/N/NZ8/00129]",This work was supported by the National Science Centre in Poland (grant number 2012/07/N/NZ8/00129).,,71,6,6,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

However, the lack of operable research system limits the studies on functional response of fungal predators. Hirsutella rhossiliensis is a dominant parasite of the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines. In a soil microcosm bioassay, we determined fungal biomass at different days within 21 days after inoculation, and parasitism rate of H. glycines by the fungus was determined. The functional response of H. rhossiliensis to H. glycines was established and found to be Holling's type III, which was influenced by mycelial densities. Meanwhile, we conducted anti-fungal analysis of metabolic fractions extracted from H. rhossiliensis to explain the potential mechanism of the intraspecific competition illustrated by functional response. The result of anti-fungal experiments indicated that the fungal predators had more complicated interaction at population level than expected, which might be regulated by self-inhibition metabolite(s). This study was the first functional response study of fungal predators in microcosm. With the increasing recognition of emerging fungal threats to animal, plant, and ecosystem health, the methodologies and hypotheses proposed in this study might inspire further research in fungal ecology.","[Shu Chi; Lai YiLing; Yang EnCe; Xiang MeiChun; Liu XingZhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Microbiol, State Key Lab Mycol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Shu Chi] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Chen SenYu] Univ Minnesota, Southern Res & Outreach Ctr, Waseca, MN 56093 USA","Xiang, MC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Microbiol, State Key Lab Mycol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",xiangmc@im.ac.cn; liuxz@im.ac.cn,"Yang, Ence/C-5938-2014","Yang, Ence/0000-0002-9526-2737",National Key Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2013CB127506]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30800732]; National Public Benefit Research Foundation of China [200903040],"This work was supported by the National Key Basic Research Program of China (2013CB127506), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (30800732), and the National Public Benefit Research Foundation of China (200903040).

Therefore, survival and reproductive success depend not only on the ability to secure prey but also on minimizing foraging costs. African wild dogs often coexist with lions (Panthera leo) and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta); these competitors can seriously increase foraging costs by kleptoparasitism. In this study, we empirically and experimentally assessed the risk and costs of kleptoparasitism for African wild dogs inside Hwange National Park, where hyena densities are high, and outside the park, where hyena densities are lower. Lion densities within the study area have been fluctuating. The risk and costs of kleptoparasitism were determined by comparing direct observations during hunt follows of radio collared African wild dog packs and by the use of experimental call-ups with African wild dog sounds inside and outside Hwange National Park. The risk of kleptoparasitism was found to be significantly higher inside the park. The time it took lions and hyenas to get to the kill site during African wild dog hunts was longer outside the park allowing the dogs a longer carcass access time. The found differences in risk and costs of kleptoparasitism could contribute to African wild dog habitat choice for the buffer zone outside Hwange National Park. As habitat choice in and around protected areas is often related to the possibility of exposure to an edge effect,'' interspecific competition should be considered in the conservation strategy of African wild dogs.","[van der Meer, Ester; Moyo, Mkhalalwa; Rasmussen, Gregory S.

We examined interactions between the two seastars in a different situation, in a mussel bed at 6 m in depth (a rare situation in this region). In the deeper mussel bed, seastars were three times more abundant than in the shallower beds, and the mussels were larger, The deeper bed disappeared rapidly due to the intense predation. Although decreased prey abundance should have favored interference interactions, we did not detect either partitioning of mussels by size or avoidance of A. vulgaris by L, polaris as previously reported when mussels are in short supply in shallower water. The lack of an avoidance behavior by L. polaris, together with the higher proportion of L. polaris than A. vulgaris that were feeding, suggests that in this situation, the dominance of A. vulgaris (observed in shallower water) is attenuated, or that L. polaris may dominate.

They may also have positive residual effects on mosquitoes after pesticide degradation, by altering the community structure, that is, by reducing abundances of mosquito competitors and predators, and via a trophic cascade, which may increase food resources for mosquito larvae. Alternatively, if a pesticide-mediated trophic cascade results in toxic or inedible algae, the pesticide can act as an ecological trap for some taxa by attracting oviposition in sites where algae are abundant but unsuitable. The present study assessed mosquito oviposition habitat selection, mosquito larval performance, and community structure alterations after applications of various pesticides. The experiment was conducted in outdoor mesocosms assigned to one of four treatments: (1) control, no pesticides; (2) Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti), a narrow-spectrum bacterium well known for its larvicidal activity on mosquitoes and other dipterans; (3) temephos, an organophosphate mosquito larvicide with community-wide spectrum effects; and (4) pyriproxyfen, a pyridine-based insect growth regulator (IGR) class with wide-spectrum effects. Soon after pesticide application, Culex pipiens oviposition was highest in the control pools. Invertebrate species richness and abundance were strongly reduced in the broad-spectrum pesticide treatments (temephos and pyriproxyfen) when compared to control. One month after pesticide application, Cx. pipiens oviposition was highest in the pyriproxyfen-treated pools, although larval survival remained lowest in the pyriproxyfen-treated pools. Our results suggest that pyriproxyfen causes a chemically mediated trophic cascade and provides an ecological trap, that is, attracting mosquito oviposition due to an altered community structure, but causing high mosquito larval mortality.","[Duchet, Claire; Moraru, Gail M.; Hayoon, Anna Gershberg; Shapir, Ronen; Blaustein, Leon] Univ Haifa Mt Carmel, Fac Nat Sci, Inst Evolut, Community Ecol Lab, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel; [Duchet, Claire; Moraru, Gail M.; Hayoon, Anna Gershberg; Shapir, Ronen; Blaustein, Leon] Univ Haifa Mt Carmel, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel; [Spencer, Matthew] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England; [Saurav, Kumar; Steindler, Laura] Univ Haifa, Leon H Charney Sch Marine Sci, Dept Marine Biol, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel; [Bertrand, Celine; Fayolle, Stephanie] Univ Avignon, Aix Marseille Univ, IMBE Inst Mediterraneen Biodiversite & Ecol Marin, CNRS,IRD,FSE Jerome, Case 431, F-13397 Marseille 20, France; [Duchet, Claire] WSU Puyallup Res & Extens Ctr, 2606 W Pioneer, Puyallup, WA 98371 USA","Duchet, C (corresponding author), Univ Haifa Mt Carmel, Fac Nat Sci, Inst Evolut, Community Ecol Lab, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel.; Duchet, C (corresponding author), Univ Haifa Mt Carmel, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Evolutionary & Environm Biol, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel.; Duchet, C (corresponding author), WSU Puyallup Res & Extens Ctr, 2606 W Pioneer, Puyallup, WA 98371 USA.",claire.duchet@wsu.edu,"Kumar, Saurav/J-7377-2017; Duchet, Claire/AAI-3569-2021; Duchet, Claire/AAL-8575-2020","Kumar, Saurav/0000-0002-7084-4204; Duchet, Claire/0000-0002-6542-650X; ",Israel Science Foundation (ISF)Israel Science Foundation [891-12],"We thank the Israel National Parks Authority for allowing us to carry out the experiment in the Hai-Bar Nature Reserve.

A few species across bee families have evolved nocturnality, displaying remarkable adaptations to overcome limitations of their daylight-suited apposition eyes. Phase inversion to nocturnality in a minority of bees that co-exist with diurnal bees provides a unique opportunity to study ecological benefits that mediate total temporal niche shifts. While floral traits and sensory modalities associated with the evolution of classical nocturnal pollination syndromes, e.g. by bats and moths, are well-studied, nocturnality in bees represents a poorly understood, recently invaded, extreme niche. To test the competitive release hypothesis, we examine how nocturnality shapes foraging by comparing pollen loads, nest pollen, and flower visitation of sympatric nocturnal and diurnal carpenter bees. We predicted that nocturnal bees primarily use night-blooming flowers, show little/no resource overlap with diurnal species and competitive release favors night-time pollen collection for provisioning. Contrarily, we found substantial resource overlap between nocturnal and diurnal bees. Flower opening times, floral longevity and plant abundance did not define nocturnal flower use. Smaller pollen loads on nocturnal foragers suggest subsistence on resource leftovers largely from diurnal flowers. Greater pollen types/diversity on nocturnal foragers indicate lower floral constancy compared to diurnal congenerics. Reduced activity during new moon compared to full moon suggests constraints to nocturnal foraging. Invasion and sustenance within the nocturnal niche is characterized by: (i) opportunistic foraging on residual resources as indicated by smaller pollen loads, extensive utilization of day-blooming flowers and substantial overlap with diurnal bees, (ii) generalization at two levels-between and within foraging trips as indicated by lower floral constancy, (iii) reduced foraging on darker nights, indicating visual constraints despite sensitive optics. This together with smaller populations and univoltine breeding in nocturnal compared to multivoltine diurnal counterparts suggest that nocturnality imposes substantial fitness costs. In conclusion, the evolution of nocturnality in bees is accompanied by resource generalization instead of specialization. Reduced floral constancy suggests differences in foraging strategies of nocturnal and diurnal bees which merits further investigation. The relative roles of competition, floral rewards and predators should be examined to fully understand the evolution and maintenance of nocturnality in bees.","[Somanathan, Hema; Krishna, Shivani; Jos, Elsa M.] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res, Sch Biol, IISER TVM Ctr Res & Educ Ecol & Evolut ICREEE, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India; [Krishna, Shivani] Ashoka Univ, Dept Biol, Sonepat, India; [Gowda, Vishwas; Borges, Renee M.] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bengaluru, India; [Kelber, Almut] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Lund, Sweden; [Jos, Elsa M.] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Gowda, Vishwas] Univ Arizona, Dept Neurosci, Tucson, AZ USA","Somanathan, H (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res, Sch Biol, IISER TVM Ctr Res & Educ Ecol & Evolut ICREEE, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.",hsomanathan@iisertvm.ac.in,"Kelber, Almut/H-6216-2014","Kelber, Almut/0000-0003-3937-2808",Swedish International Development Agency; Wenner-Gren foundation; IISER Thiruvananthapuram,"We thank Kalu Kurade, Ganpat Lohkare, and Subhash Vangere for field assistance and the Maharashtra Forest Department for permissions.

Due to the pack predation-herd behavior, the predator-prey interaction occurs only at the outer edge of each group. First, we analyze the existence and local stability of the equilibria of temporal model using vector field analysis and characteristic equations. Second, we deduce the conditions under which Turing instability occurs with the help of linear stability analysis. Then, using standard multiple-scale analysis, we derive the amplitude equations for the excited modes. By numerical simulations, we find that the model exhibits complex pattern replication by varying the value of parameters a and d(21), and study the relationships between the average density of both prey and predator and these two parameters.","[Yang, Jingen; Yuan, Sanling] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tonghua] Swinburne Univ Technol, Dept Math, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia","Yuan, SL (corresponding author), Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China.",tonghuazhang@swin.edu.au; sanling@usst.edu.cn,,"Yuan, Sanling/0000-0002-0502-3653",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11671260],Research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 11671260).,,53,6,6,4,20,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0218-1274,1793-6551,,INT J BIFURCAT CHAOS,Int.

Unlike their marine counterparts, freshwater dinoflagellates are rarely considered to be potential toxin producers. Here we tested whether the winter species Peridinium aciculiferum produces a toxin(s) and investigated the potential adaptive function of that toxin, i.e., predator defense or inhibition of competitors (allelopathy). Using traditional toxicity bioassays (Artemia toxicity test and hemolytic activity assay). we detected the production of a toxic substance by P. aciculiferum cells from both the field and from laboratory cultures. Cultures deprived of phosphorus and in stationary phase showed highest toxicity. Potential predators, such as Daphnia galeata (Cladocera) and Eudiaptomus graciloides (Copepoda), were apparently not harmed by P. aciculiferum toxicity. However, the naturally coaccurring competitor Rhodomonas lacustris (Cryptophyceae) was killed by P. aciculiferum. An allelopathic substance(s) caused the cells of R. lacustris to form blisters and subsequently lyse. We concluded that our results support the hypothesis that P. aciculiferum is allelopathic, but not that toxins serve as predator defense. We therefore suggest that allelopathy may be an adaptive strategy of winter dinoflagellates, which could allow them to outcompete other phytoplankton species and thereby dominate the algal biomass.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Limnol, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Kalmar, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Marine Sci Div, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden","Rengefors, K (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",Karin.Rengefors@limnol.lu.se,"Rengefors, Karin/K-5873-2019","Legrand, Catherine/0000-0001-7155-3604; Rengefors, Karin/0000-0001-6297-9734",,,,32,81,93,2,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0024-3590,1939-5590,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR,Limnol.

We found that 86% of the overwintering invertebrates in traps were predators, which were dominated by spiders (72%) of different guilds and different body sizes. Spiders had spatially segregated in the traps so that smaller specimens hid in an interstitial space that was inaccessible to larger specimens. Spiders of the bark-dwelling guild, Anyphaena and Philodromus, are winter-active and can prey on other smaller spiders. Analysis of their abundance in traps indicated a negative relationship between Anyphaena and Philodromus or other spiders. Inspection of traps during winter revealed an influx of spider specimens confirming their winter-activity. In a semi-field experiment, where overwintering in cardboard bands was studied under controlled conditions, we observed mortality of both winter-active Philodromus and Anyphaena spiders due to their interspecific predation. The mortality was affected by their size ratio - larger specimens consumed smaller ones. Presence of alternative prey, theridiid spiders, did not affect their mortalities, but the presence of shelters (interstitial spaces) did. In boards with interstitial spaces smaller spiders suffered lower mortality than in boards without the interstitial spaces. Obtained results suggest that intraguild predation between overwintering spiders can decrease their population density during winter. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

More proximal variables, such as potential prey fields, could refine relationships between top predator distributions and their environment. In situ data on prey distributions are not available over large spatial scales but, a numerical model, the Spatial Ecosystem And POpulation DYnamics Model (SEAPODYM), provides simulations of the biomass and production of zooplankton and six functional groups of micronekton at the global scale. Here, we explored whether generalised additive models fitted to simulated prey distribution data better predicted deep-diver densities (here beaked whales Ziphiidae and sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus) than models fitted to environmental variables. We assessed whether the combination of environmental and prey distribution data would further improve model fit by comparing their explanatory power. For both taxa, results were suggestive of a preference for habitats associated with topographic features and thermal fronts but also for habitats with an extended euphotic zone and with large prey of the lower mesopelagic layer. For beaked whales, no SEAPODYM variable was selected in the best model that combined the two types of variables, possibly because SEAPODYM does not accurately simulate the organisms on which beaked whales feed on. For sperm whales, the increase model performance was only marginal. SEAPODYM outputs were at best weakly correlated with sightings of deep-diving cetaceans, suggesting SEAPODYM may not accurately predict the prey fields of these taxa. This study was a first investigation and mostly highlighted the importance of the physiographic variables to understand mechanisms that influence the distribution of deep-diving cetaceans. A more systematic use of SEAPODYM could allow to better define the limits of its use and a development of the model that would simulate larger prey beyond 1,000 m would probably better characterise the prey of deep-diving cetaceans.","[Virgili, Auriane; Hedon, Laura; Authier, Matthieu; Doremus, Ghislain; Laran, Sophie; Van Canneyt, Olivier; Ridoux, Vincent] UMS 3462 CNRS La Rochelle Univ, Observ PELAGIS, La Rochelle, France; [Authier, Matthieu; Pettex, Emeline] ADERA, Pessac, France; [Calmettes, Beatriz; Lehodey, Patrick] CLS, Space Oceanog Div, Ramonville St Agne, France; [Claridge, Diane; Dunn, Charlotte] Bahamas Marine Mammal Res Org, Marsh Harbour, Abaco, Bahamas; [Cole, Tim; Corkeron, Peter; Lewis, Mark; Palka, Debra] NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Sci, Protected Species Branch, Woods Hole, MA USA; [Dunn, Tim E.] Joint Nat Conservat Comm, Inverdee House, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Louzao, Maite] AZTI, Marine Res, Basque Res & Technol Alliance BRTA, Pasaia, Spain; [Mannocci, Laura] Univ Montpellier, MARBEC, CNRS, Ifremer,IRD, Sete, France; [Martinez-Cedeira, Jose] CEMMA, Pontevedra, Spain; [Monestiez, Pascal] INRA, BioSP, Avignon, France; [Monestiez, Pascal; Ridoux, Vincent] UMR 7372 CNRS La Rochelle Univ, Ctr Etud Biol Chize La Rochelle, Villiers En Bois, France; [Pettex, Emeline] La Rochelle Univ, Cohabys ADERA, La Rochelle, France; [Roberts, Jason J.] Duke Univ, Marine Geospatial Ecol Lab, Durham, NC USA; [Ruiz, Leire] AMBAR Elkartea Org, Bizkaia, Spain; [Saavedra, Camilo; Santos, M.

Due to large cell size and several grazer-avoidance strategies, G. semen is hypothesized to be inedible for most zooplankton species and therefore may constitute a bottleneck for the transfer of energy and nutrients in pelagic food webs. Repression of other phytoplankton through increased competition and induced mortality could further exacerbate this effect. In a field study of four lakes with recurring blooms of G. semen and four lakes without blooms, we found significant differences in community structure between the two lake groups during the bloom period. Bloom-lakes had lower biovolumes of small chrysophytes and chlorophytes and zooplankton assemblages were predominated by small, potentially bacterivorous cladocerans, suggesting a limited availability of edible phytoplankton and an increased importance of microbial pathways during G. semen blooms. Low biovolumes of large cladocerans in bloom-lakes may be due to interference of G. semen with filter feeding. Moreover, high abundances of the phantom midge Chaoborus flavicans in bloom-lakes suggest that the flow of energy and nutrients is directed more towards this invertebrate predator than fish. This could have negative impacts on fish populations, especially if bloom periods are prolonged.","[Johansson, Karin S.

We compared the swans' attack rates, foraging costs and giving-up densities (GUDs) in natural and experimental food patches that differed in water depth. Unlike most studies that attribute habitat-specific differences in GUDs to predation risk, food quality or foraging substrate, we quantified the relative importance of energetic costs and accessibility. Accessibility is defined as the extent to which the animal's morphology restricts its harvest of all food items within a food patch. Patch use behaviours were measured at shallow (ca 0.4 m) and deep (ca 0.6 m) water depths on sandy sediments. In a laboratory foraging experiment, when harvesting food patches, the swan's attack rate (m(3) s(-1)) did not differ between depths. In deep water the energetic costs of surfacing, feeding and trampling were 1.13 to 1.21 times higher than in shallow water with a tendency to spend relatively more time trampling, the most expensive activity. Taking time allocation as measured in the field into account, foraging in deep water was 1.26 times as expensive as in shallow water. In the lake the GUD in shallow water was on average 12.9 g m(-2). If differences in energetic costs were the only factor determining differences in GUDs, then the deep water GUD should be 14.2 g m(-2). Instead, the mean GUD in deep water was 20.2 g m(-2), and therefore energetic costs explain just 18% of the difference in GUDs. At deep sites, 24% of tuber biomass was estimated to be out of reach, and we calculated a maximum accessible foraging depth of 0.86 m. This is close to the published 0.84 m based on body measurements. A laboratory experiment with food offered at a depth of 0.89 m confirmed that it was just out of reach. The agreement between calculated and observed maximum accessible foraging depths suggests that accessibility largely explains the remaining difference in GUDs with depth, and it confirms the existence of partial prey refuges in this system.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Entomol, NL-6700 EH Wageningen, Netherlands; Netherlands Inst Ecol, NIOO, KNAW, Dept Plant Anim Interact, NL-3600 Maarssen, Netherlands","Nolet, BA (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, CEES, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands.",nolet@nioo.knaw.nl,"Nolet, Bart A/C-1416-2008","Nolet, Bart A/0000-0002-7437-4879",,,,45,48,52,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2006,112,2,,,,,353,362,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2006.13463.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,005CR,WOS:000234800700012,,,,,2021-09-27,

Nonetheless, little is known about the effects of stocked Rainbow Trout on native non-game species. We conducted experiments in an artificial stream to assess the effects of hatchery Rainbow Trout on home range and behaviour of Warpaint Shiners (Luxilus coccogenis Cope), a common minnow frequently found in stocked Southern Appalachian streams. We used the LoCoH algorithm to generate polygons describing the home ranges used by Warpaint Shiners. When a stocked trout was present Warpaint Shiners: (a) increased home range size by 57%, (b) were displaced into higher velocity mesohabitats, and (c) reduced mean overlap between the home ranges of individual warpaint shiners. Rainbow Trout did not significantly affect the edge/area ratio of Warpaint Shiner home ranges. Warpaint Shiner density (two and five fish treatments) did not significantly affect any response variable.

Initially, we focused on the role of biotic interactions including predation, interspecific competition, and herbivory in small mammal and plant components of the community. We utilized a reductionist approach with replicated 0.56 ha fenced grids that selectively excluded vertebrate predators and/or larger small mammal herbivores such as the degu, Octodon degas. Although we detected small transitory effects of predator exclusions on degu survival and numbers, other species failed to show responses. Similarly, interspecific competition (i.e., degus with other small mammals) had no detectable numerical effects (although some behavioral responses occurred), and degu-exclusions had relatively small effects on various plant components. Modeling approaches indicate that abiotic factors play a determining role in the dynamics of principal small mammal species such as O. degas and the leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini). In turn, these are mainly related to aperiodic pulses of higher rainfall (usually during El Nino events) which trigger ephemeral plant growth; a food addition experiment. in 1997-2000 verified the importance of precipitation as a determinant of food availability. Since 2004, we have expanded long-term monitoring efforts to other important community components including birds and insects in order to understand effects of abiotic factors on them; we report some of the first results of comprehensive surveys on the former in this region. Finally, we recently shifted focus to documenting effects of exotic lagomorphs in the park. We installed additional treatments selectively excluding small mammals, lagomorphs, or both, from replicated grids in order to evaluate putative herbivore impacts. In conjunction with increased annual rainfall since 2000, we predict that introduced lagomorphs will have increasing impacts in this region, and that more frequent El Ninos in conjunction with global climatic change may lead to marked changes in community dynamics. The importance of long-term experimental studies is underscored by the fact that only now after 20 years of work are some patterns becoming evident.","[Gutierrez, Julio R.] Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, La Serena, Chile; [Gutierrez, Julio R.] Univ La Serena, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Zonas Aridas, La Serena, Chile; [Meserve, Peter L.; Previtali, M.

The foraging activity of the I. elegans larvae was significantly reduced in the presence of a free-swimming predator but not a caged predator. Abdominal movements were significantly reduced at a low prey density, Growth was significantly reduced by the presence of a free swimming predator and low prey densities. These results provide evidence that these damselfly larvae adjust their behavior to the presence of predators to increase their survival at the expense of reduced growth and development.","Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada; Univ Zurich, Dept Zool, Zurich, Switzerland","Anholt, BR (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, POB 1700, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada.",,,,,,,35,33,35,0,26,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0892-7553,1572-8889,,J INSECT BEHAV,J.

We described the host-use pattern and sexual dimorphism of A. aidae to test for monogamy given the generality of this mating system in the subfamily Pinnothereliinae (family Pinnotheridae) to which A. aidae belongs. Against expectations, A. aidae lives as solitary individuals within burrows more frequently than expected by chance alone. Additional observations suggested that A. aidae exhibits a polygynandrous mating system with males moving among burrows in search of receptive females. First, only 21% of the burrows harboured heterosexual pairs of crabs and the body size of paired crabs was poorly correlated. This suggests pair instability and frequent shifts among burrows by male and/or female crabs, as reported before for other symbiotic crustaceans in which the body size of paired crabs is poorly correlated. Second, males paired with females that were sexually receptive (without embryos) or that have been receptive recently (carrying early embryos) were found more frequently than expected by chance alone. The above agrees with that reported for species in which sexual pairing does not last long. Third, sexual dimorphism in terms of claw size and coloration was evident. Claws were larger in males than in females, a condition that argues in favour of male-male competition in A. aidae. In addition, the body coloration of males was more similar to the sand grains of the beach than that of females. This sex-specific coloration suggests that males are 'better adapted' than females to roam on the surface of the beach in search of burrows because their coloration should diminish the risk of detection by predators. Experiments are needed to reveal the details of the polygynandrous mating system herein inferred for A. aidae and to understand those conditions favouring particular reproductive strategies in symbiotic decapod crustaceans.","[Peiro, Douglas F.; Mantelatto, Fernando L.] Univ Sao Paulo, Lab Bioecol & Crustacean Systemat LBSC, Fac Philosophy Sci & Letters Ribeirao Preto FFCLR, Dept Biol,Postgrad Program Comparat Biol, BR-14040901 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil; [Antonio Baeza, J.] Smithsonian Marine Stn Ft Pierce, Ft Pierce, FL USA; [Antonio Baeza, J.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23435 USA; [Antonio Baeza, J.] Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, Dept Biol Marina, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile","Mantelatto, FL (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Lab Bioecol & Crustacean Systemat LBSC, Fac Philosophy Sci & Letters Ribeirao Preto FFCLR, Dept Biol,Grad Program Comparat Biol, Ave Bandeirantes 3900, BR-14040901 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.",flmantel@usp.br,"Peiro, Douglas F/E-1203-2011; Mantelatto, Fernando L/H-2695-2012; Mantelatto, Fernando/N-9536-2019","Peiro, Douglas F/0000-0003-4928-1432; Mantelatto, Fernando L/0000-0002-8497-187X; Mantelatto, Fernando/0000-0002-8497-187X; Baeza, Juan Antonio/0000-0002-2573-6773","CAPES-Brazil (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); CNPq-Brazil (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [302748/2010-5]; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [471794/2006-6, 473050/2007-2]; FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2010/50188-8]","This study formed part of a Master's degree thesis by D.F.P., and was supported by a fellowship from CAPES-Brazil (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior).

The novel finding was that meroplankton and attached benthos were apparently effective competitors and predators of planktonic copepods in both nutrient-limited and nutrient-enriched systems. During the spring period of increase Acartia hudsonica, as well as other abundant species of copepods, reached considerably higher numbers in four mesocosms without sediments than in four other mesocosms with the normal sediment community in place regardless of rate of nutrient input to the mesocosms. Measurements of population parameters of A. hudsonica indicated equivalent rates of reproduction, growth, and recruitment in nutrient-enriched treatments with and without sediments. Suppression of population growth in the presence of sediments was therefore not due to food limitation but, by inference, to higher rates of mortality associated with high abundances of potential predators of benthic origin. In unriched control mesocosms, resource competition with the benthos may also have contributed to low population densities in tanks with sediments (reproductive rates were more food limited in enclosures with sediment that in those without sediment).

I have reviewed the recent primary literature in order to assess quantitatively the frequency of studies of mutualism, the types of questions they address, and their general scientific approach. All articles appearing from 1986 to 1990 in nine major journals that publish ecological and evolutionary research were examined. It is clear that mutualism research is not in fact rare. Studies of interspecific interactions made up about 22% of the over 4500 articles published during this period; of these, about one-quarter investigated some form of mutualism. Over 90% of them investigated plant-animal interactions, primarily pollination (52 %) and seed dispersal (31 %), a bias probably related in part to the particular journals examined. The diversity of questions addressed in these articles was surprisingly low. The majority (63 %) focused simply on identifying the mutualists of some species of interest. Furthermore, almost all studies were unilateral, that is, they focused on only one of the interacting species, plants being studied much more frequently than their animal partners. Mutualism studies do not appear to have focused on mutualism as a form of interaction in the same way as studies of competition and predation. Rather, researchers have treated mutualism primarily as a life history attribute of one of the two partners. Consequently, although an impressive amount of information has accumulated about these interactions, we are still far from achieving an overall picture that transcends the boundaries of particular taxa or combinations of taxa. Three other obstacles have prevented data on mutualisms from being brought together: the historical isolation of studies of different kinds of mutualism, a nearly total disconnection between mutualism theories and empirical studies, and the unilateral approach almost always used to study these bilateral interactions. I identify eight research questions whose answers have the potential to reveal broad-based generalizations about the evolution and ecology of mutualism.",,"BRONSTEIN, JL (corresponding author), UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.",,,,,,,171,359,372,6,208,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0033-5770,1539-7718,,Q REV BIOL,Q.

A distribution model on 10 x 10 km cells of Sicily was described using Generalized Linear Models and variation partitioning methods. This modelling approach extracted explanatory factors, pure and joint effects of greatest influence from subsets of variables controlled for multi-collinearity and spatial autocorrelation. Analytical cartography used the environmental favourability function to assess habitat preferences, and the insecurity index estimated the degree to which lanner falcon occupancy is represented in the Natura2000 networks of Sicily. The lanner population is not randomly distributed across the geographical space as the significant latitudinal effect revealed. The most parsimonious explanatory model suggested traditional agro-ecosystems (i.e. arable lowlands and grasslands, with rugged terrains and cliffs) as the best predictors of lanner occupancy, and gave strong support to the negative effects of land abandonment and intensification (i.e. increase of heterogeneous areas and shrubby vegetation). The variation partitioning method suggested how an alteration of traditional agro-ecosystems might enhance interference competition with the peregrine falcon and limit lanner falcon occupancy. Most of the lanner falcon favourable habitats fall outside the Natura2000 networks, thus the main challenge for its conservation is represented by agri-environmental measures to be taken within the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union. Conservation of traditional agro-ecosystems devoted to top-predators, like the lanner falcon, requires single environmental management agreements for multiple farm units, deployed at landscape scale on a network of favourable areas.

This kind of indirect effects has received little attention to date, although recent research suggest they may not be infrequent. Chytridiomycosis is an EID that is affecting amphibian assemblages worldwide. Here we present the first (to our knowledge) field evidence of its indirect effect on assemblage structure through the disruption of a biotic interaction. We have documented an expansion of the common toad (Bufo bufo) after chytridiomycosis nearly extirpated the midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) in Penalara Natural Park (Central Spain). Bufo bufo has significantly increased its number of breeding sites. All newly occupied breeding ponds were colonized once the large numbers of large, overwintering A. obstetricans tadpoles they had previously held disappeared. An experiment demonstrated that breeding B. bufo adults strongly avoided laying eggs in water containing A. obstetricans tadpoles, accounting for observed patterns of pond use. A second experiment failed to show any predation by large A. obstetricans tadpoles on B. bufo eggs, but other researchers have documented reductions in condition, growth and survival of B. bufo larvae caused by the presence of A. obstetricans tadpoles. In Penalara, chytridiomycosis attacks B. bufo too, but its effect on it has been quite less severe than on A. obstetricans. Our findings show how, besides any chytridiomycosis direct effects, interspecific differences in its impact may alter assemblage-influencing biotic interactions and, hence, assemblage structure in indirect ways.","[Bosch, Jaime; Rincon, Pedro A.] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Bosch, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",bosch@mncn.csic.es,"Bosch, Jaime/H-3042-2011","Bosch, Jaime/0000-0002-0099-7934",,,,55,24,25,3,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

As a result of this disturbance, introduced honeybees are now the dominant visitors to flowers instead of endemic bees on these islands. On the other hand, satellite islands not invaded by alien anoles have retained the native flower visitors. The effects of pollinator change on plant reproduction were surveyed on these contrasting island groups. The total visitation rates and the number of interacting visitor groups on main islands were 63% and 30% lower than that on satellite islands, respectively. On the main islands, the honeybees preferred to visit alien flowers, whereas the dominant endemic bees on satellite islands tended to visit native flowers more frequently than alien flowers. These results suggest that alien anoles destroy the endemic pollination system and caused shift to alien mutualism. On the main islands, the natural fruit set of alien plants was significantly higher than that of native plants. In addition, the natural fruit set was positively correlated with the visitation rate of honeybees. Pollen limitation was observed in 53.3% of endemic species but only 16.7% of alien species.

We investigated potential mechanisms underlying the patchy local distribution of the devil crayfish (Cambarus diogenes Girard) in a stream floodplain ecosystem of the coastal plain of Alabama. We used a series of field surveys and laboratory trials to: 1) quantify local distributions and soil-type associations, 2) identify soil preferences of juveniles and adults, 3) examine the effects of biotic (adult occupancy) and abiotic (soil compaction) factors on juvenile burrowing preferences, and 4) investigate the role of floodplain connectivity on burrow density. Juvenile crayfish were more abundant in sandy streamside soils, whereas adults were more abundant in clay-based floodplain soils. In laboratory preference trials in artificial burrowing chambers, adults and juveniles showed affinity for floodplain over streamside soils, a result suggesting that factors other than soil preference influence field patterns. When juveniles were presented with situations where adults were established, they initiated burrows in association with the adult burrows regardless of soil type. Soil compaction did not influence juvenile burrowing preference, but did result in smaller burrows in laboratory trials. Adult burrow density in the floodplain was negatively related to stream bank angle and top-of-bank height. Juvenile C. diogenes took longer to climb banks with high bank angles than those with low bank angles, a result suggesting increased risk of predation and desiccation associated with disconnected floodplain conditions. Local distribution of C. diogenes burrows in stream/floodplain systems appears to be a product of interacting physical and biological factors rather than of soil-type preferences. Stream-floodplain connectivity may affect recruitment and population viability of burrowing crayfish.","[Helms, Brian; Kosnicki, Ely; Feminella, Jack] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Budnick, William; Skipper, James; Stoeckel, James] Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Pecora, Paolo] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Helms, B (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",helmsbs@auburn.edu; wbudni1@lsu.edu; pap0003@auburn.edu; jds0003@auburn.edu; ezk0004@auburn.edu; feminjw@auburn.edu; jas0018@auburn.edu,"Budnick, William/ABI-7625-2020",,Auburn University Undergraduate Research Fellowship Program; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0949624],"Partial funding was provided by the Auburn University Undergraduate Research Fellowship Program and the National Science Foundation (DEB 0949624).

Specifically, we determined the vertical distribution of C. pengoi in Lake Ontario with respect to other zooplankton species and possible biotic and abiotic controlling factors and used seasonal time series of potential prey species, both before and after C. pengoi invasion. to make inferences about predatory impacts of C. pengoi. The highest abundances of C. pengoi generally Occurred at the bottom of the epilimnion or at the top of the metalimnion, and strong diet vertical migration was not observed. The vertical distribution of cyclopoid and calanoid nauplii and copepodids was deeper in 1999 than had historically been observed, which Suggest possible avoidance of C. pengoi or localized predatory depletion. Seasonal analyses of normalized biomass size spectra from the Bay Of Quinte supported an impact of C. pengoi on organisms <0.1 mu q, dry weight. The hypothesized predatory effect on juvenile copepods was supported by an analysis of seasonal time series, where we observed that high abundances of C. pengoi coincided with marked decreases in these groups. Consequently, the presence of C. pengoi likely decreases the production Of juvenile copepods both through direct predation and through a shift of copepod vertical distribution to colder waters.

Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis and Gambusia holbrooki) have been introduced throughout the world to control larval mosquito populations in aquatic environments, but they have also been implicated in the decline of native fish, amphibian, and aquatic invertebrate populations. We investigated the roles of introduced western mosquitofish (G. affinis), and two naturally colonizing predators (crayfish and dragonfly naiads) in inflicting tail injuries observed on ranid frog tadpoles in experimental constructed wetlands. We also examined the influence of vegetation in reducing tail injury severity. We found that mosquitofish significantly increased the prevalence and severity of tail injuries, but crayfish and dragonfly naiads contributed much less to increased injury levels. Furthermore, increased vegetation cover did not significantly attenuate tail injuries. However, after chemical removal of Gambusia, injury prevalence and severity was significantly reduced. Although previous investigations have concluded that mosquitofish prey upon the eggs and larvae of some amphibians, our results illustrate that these fish can cause substantial but apparently sub-lethal injuries to large numbers of larval amphibians in a wetland. Further investigations are needed to determine if these injuries impede the fitness of victims and lead to population reductions.","[Shulse, Christopher D.] Missouri Dept Transportat, Jefferson City, MO 65102 USA; [Semlitsch, Raymond D.] Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Semlitsch, RD (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",Christopher.Shulse@modot.mo.gov; SemlitschR@missouri.edu,,"Semlitsch, Raymond/0000-0002-7999-5762",United States Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [CD-98769101-0]; Missouri Department of Conservation Wildlife Diversity Fund Grant; Missouri Department of Transportation Research and Development Grant [RI 07-005],"We thank the staff of the Missouri Department of Transportation, Missouri Department of Conservation, and University of Missouri Division of Biological Sciences.

The mean time in which the corpses stayed out in the field is less than five minutes (x = 285 +/- 282 s), in a range of 2-2228 s. This holds true in cleared areas as well as in high vegetation areas. Ants are the principal scavengers of this type of remains, although the species that collect them vary according to the time of day and season of year, with the corpses' disappearance being the most rapid during the middle hours of the day, precisely when ants' density on the ground is less. The reason for this was the peak daytime abundance of insectivore, opportunistics ants. Anyway, the short time lapse that the prey stay in the field - at any time of the day - can be considered as an indirect estimate of the scarcity of these resources.","CSIC,CID,E-08034 BARCELONA,SPAIN; AUTONOMOUS UNIV BARCELONA,DEPT ANIM BIOL VEGETAL BIOL & ECOL,E-08193 BARCELONA,SPAIN","RETANA, J (corresponding author), AUTONOMOUS UNIV BARCELONA,CREAF,E-08193 BARCELONA,SPAIN.",,"Cerda, Xim/P-6461-2014; Espadaler, Xavier/F-1898-2011; Retana, Javier/L-1214-2014","Cerda, Xim/0000-0002-3222-2471; Espadaler, Xavier/0000-0002-7681-5957; Retana, Javier/0000-0002-7505-9467",,,,33,36,36,0,5,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0105-9327,,,HOLARCTIC ECOL,,JAN,1991,14,1,,,,,63,67,,,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FB367,WOS:A1991FB36700009,,,,,2021-09-27,

We used the holm oak Quercus ilex-wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus mutualism as a model system to evaluate the relative importance of seed size and fat content on scatter-hoarders' foraging decisions influencing oak dispersal and potential recruitment. We performed a field experiment in which we offered holm oak acorns with contrasting seed size (2 vs 5 g) and fat content (3 vs 11%). Moreover, to test if the strength of these seed trait effects was context-dependent, experimental acorns were placed in small fragments, where natural regeneration is scarce or absent, and forest habitats. In small fragments, rodents had to face increased intraspecific competition for acorns and reduced anti-predator cover during transportation. As a result, they became more selective to ensure rapid acquisition of most valuable food items but, in turn, transported seeds closer to avoid unaffordable predation risks. During harvesting and caching, larger acorns were prioritized and preferentially cached. Fat content only had a minor effect in harvesting preferences. In contrast, in forest sites, where rodent abundance was four times lower and understory cover was well-developed, rodents were not selective but provided enhanced dispersal services to oaks (caching rates were 75% higher). From the plants' perspective, our results imply that the benefits of producing costly seeds are context-dependent. Seed traits modified harvesting and caching rates only when rodents were forced to forage more efficiently in response to increased intraspecific competition. However, when landscape traits limited cache protection strategies, a more selective foraging behavior by scatter-hoarders did not result in enhanced dispersal services. Overall, our result shows that successful dispersal of acorns depends on how specific traits modulate their value and how landscape properties affect rodents' ability to safeguard them for later consumption.","[Moran-Lopez, T.; Valladares, F.; Perez-Sepulveda, J.

Fish were sam-pled from single-species and mixed assemblages in 2-m(3) cages for 8 weeks during April and May. Both species initially ate mostly cyclopoid copepodites and small cladocerans (Bosmina spp.). Schoener's index of diet overlap showed considerable overlap (70-90%). Lake whitefish ate Daphnia spp, and adult copepods about 2 weeks earlier than did lake herring, perhaps related to their larger mean mouth gape. Lake whitefish were consistently larger than lake herring until the eighth week, especially in the sympatric treatments. Lake whitefish appeared to have a negative effect on the growth of lake herring, as lake herring in mixed-species treatments were smaller and weighed less than lake herring reared in single-species treatments. The diet similarities of lake whitefish and lake herring larvae could make them competitors for food in the Great Lakes. The greater initial size of lake whitefish could allow them to eat larger prey earlier and thereby limit availability of these prey to lake herring at a crucial period of development.","Great Lakes Sci Ctr, Biol Resources Div, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA","Davis, BM (corresponding author), Great Lakes Sci Ctr, Biol Resources Div, 1451 Green Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA.",bruce_davis@USGS.GOV,,,,,,46,20,24,1,17,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

We used a hostparasitoid system consisting of necrophagous Diptera species and their pupal parasitoids. The basal resources used by the host species were assumed to be ephemeral, supporting only one generation of individuals before completely disappearing from the environment. We experimentally measured the hostparasitoid persistence and the effects of local demographic processes in two scenarios: 1) constant occurrence of basal resources at a single site (no dispersion or colonization of other sites) and 2) variable occurrence of basal resources between two sites (colonization of a new patch requiring species dispersal). The experimental setup and findings were then formalized into a mathematical model describing the interaction dynamics in a MELP structure. We evaluated the contribution of several factors to the hostparasitoid coexistence, such as resource allocation probability (probability of resource appearance in a site), variation in resource size and number of sites available to receive resources in the MELP. We found that demographic fluctuations and environmental stochasticity affected the density of migrants, patch habitat connectivity, persistence and spatial distribution of interacting species.","[Reigada, Carolina; de Aguiar, Marcus A.

Degraded stream communities are often dominated by organisms with shell or case protections, such as snails, which are less vulnerable to predation than desired organisms, such as mayflies. Unprotected organisms may be preferentially eaten, limiting biotic restoration success after the physical restoration of degraded stream communities. We investigated whether restoration success depended on differences in vulnerability to predation by testing whether consumption-based interaction strengths (IS) between vulnerable colonizing Deleatidium spp. mayflies and upland bullies (Gobiomorphus breviceps) changed with different densities of protected Potamopyrgus antipodarum snails and whether snails affected Deleatidium behavior. Deleatidium and fish IS were stronger with fewer Deleatidium present, a destabilizing effect on vulnerable prey populations, and less total prey biomass was consumed with higher densities of protected relative to vulnerable prey, potentially having long-term negative effects on predators. Furthermore, mayflies appeared less on surfaces with high snail densities, potentially due to altered resource use. The combination of these biotic interactions could form a barrier to successful biotic restoration by preventing colonization of desired vulnerable prey, through priority effects within the established community. Therefore, considering biotic interactions in stream restoration is important to overcome biotic restoration barriers.","[White, Bridget E.; McIntosh, Angus R.; Warburton, Helen J.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand; [Febria, Catherine M.] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, 2990 Riverside Dr W, Windsor, ON N9C 1A2, Canada","White, BE (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand.",bridget.el.white@gmail.com,"; McIntosh, Angus/B-2992-2011","White, Bridget/0000-0002-9040-5065; Febria, Catherine/0000-0002-3570-3588; McIntosh, Angus/0000-0003-2696-8813","University of Canterbury Freshwater Ecology Research Group (UC FERG); New Zealand's Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (New Zealand's Biological Heritage National Science Challenge) [C09X1501]; Mackenzie Charitable Foundation as part of the Canterbury Waterway Rehabilitation Experiment (CAREX); Waterways Centre for Freshwater Management","We thank the University of Canterbury Freshwater Ecology Research Group (UC FERG) for their support throughout this research, in particular Linda Morris for organizing essential equipment, and Issie Barrett and Kate Hornblow for extensive help and support during the experiments.

We present data collated over an 8-year period from a catchment of geothermally heated streams in Iceland, which acts as a natural experiment on the effects of warming across different organisational levels and spatiotemporal scales. Body sizes and population biomasses of individual species responded strongly to temperature, with some providing evidence to support temperature size rules. Macroinvertebrate and meiofaunal community composition also changed dramatically across the thermal gradient. Interactions within the warm streams in particular were characterised by food chains linking algae to snails to the apex predator, brown trout These chains were missing from the colder systems, where snails were replaced by much smaller herbivores and invertebrate omnivores were the top predators. Trout were also subsidised by terrestrial invertebrate prey, which could have an effect analogous to apparent competition within the aquatic prey assemblage. Top-down effects by snails on diatoms were stronger in the warmer streams, which could account for a shallowing of mass-abundance slopes across the community. This may indicate reduced energy transfer efficiency from resources to consumers in the warmer systems and/or a change in predator-prey mass ratios. All the ecosystem process rates investigated increased with temperature, but with differing thermal sensitivities, with important implications for overall ecosystem functioning (e.g. creating potential imbalances in elemental fluxes). Ecosystem respiration rose rapidly with temperature, leading to increased heterotrophy. There were also indications that food web stability may be lower in the warmer streams.","[O'Gorman, Eoin J.; Pichler, Doris E.; Cohen, Haley; Craig, Nicola; Hawczak, Adrianna; Johansson, Liselotte; Mavromati, Efpraxia; Perkins, Daniel M.; Stewart, Rebecca; Thompson, Murray S.

We hypothesized that the abiotic environment mediates the interaction between an ant-dispersed plant, Datura wrightii (Solanaceae), ant mutualists, and rodent seed predators in the Sonoran Desert. Field experiments contrasting diurnal and nocturnal seed collection rates in the presence of ants only, vertebrates only, and in the presence of both groups indicated that 85% of seed collection by mammalian seed predators occurred at night (between 1900 and 0700). Seed collection by ants, in contrast, was similar between day and night, although seed collection decreased during very hot days and very bright nights. The total number of seeds collected by both groups foraging separately exceeded the number removed when both groups shared access to seed depots, suggesting that ants and rodents compete for seeds. However, D. wrightii plants dehisced 86% of their fruits between 0700 and 1900, increasing the likelihood of seed collection by ant mutualists rather than rodent seed predators. Dehiscence was sensitive to environmental cues: greenhouse plants kept at constant temperature and humidity dehisced 47% of their fruits between 0700 and 1900. Additional field experiments demonstrated that seed-collecting ants transported seeds considerable distances to their nests, microsites that can be rich in nutrients. The mean ( SE) seed dispersal distance was 6.1 +/- 0.5 m, the longest mean dispersal distance yet reported for an ant-dispersed seed.","Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Ness, JH (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",jness@email.arizona.edu,,,,,,28,22,22,0,22,UNIVERSITE LAVAL,ST FOY,"PAVILLON CHARLES-EUGENE MARCHAND, LOCAL 0166, ST FOY, QUEBEC G1K 7P4, CANADA",1195-6860,,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2005,12,1,,,,,76,81,,10.2980/i1195-6860-12-1-76.1,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,913AE,WOS:000228121300011,,,,,2021-09-27,

We evaluated body condition and survival during breeding and non-breeding periods in two closely related species with notably different reproductive systems. Male and female saltmarsh sparrows Ammodramus caudacutus represent extremes in parental care: males perform none, leaving females to do everything from build nests to care for fledglings. In contrast, male and female seaside sparrows A. maritimus have bi-parental care and similar levels of reproductive investment, intermediate between male and female saltmarsh sparrows. Our results are consistent with the idea that females experience non-lethal effects of reproduction, and that differences between the breeding season and winter affect condition. In both species, females had lower scaled mass index (SMI) values than males during both breeding and non-breeding seasons, and female saltmarsh sparrows had lower SMI values than female seaside sparrows. Females carried more fat than males during the breeding season, and female, but not male, fat and muscle scores decreased over time, which is consistent with the adaptive mass hypothesis. In winter, all groups carried more fat and had higher muscle scores than when breeding, despite having lower SMI scores. Although we observed variation in body condition, within-season survival was uniformly high in both seasons, suggesting that sex, species, season, body size, and body condition have little impacts on within season survival. Comparisons with previously-published estimates of annual adult survival suggest that most mortality occurs during migration, even in these short-distance migrants. The importance of considering multiple aspects of body condition, multiple seasons, and difficult-to-monitor events, such as migration, should not be ignored when thinking about the events and processes that cumulatively determine population dynamics.","[Borowske, Alyssa; Field, Christopher R.; Elphick, Chris S.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Field, Christopher R.] Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr, Annapolis, MD USA; [Ruskin, Katharine J.] Univ Maine, Climate Change Inst, Ecol & Environm Sci Program, Orono, ME USA","Borowske, A (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",a.c.borowske@gmail.com,"; Ruskin, Katharine/P-6551-2018","Field, Christopher/0000-0002-8305-7728; Ruskin, Katharine/0000-0003-1999-2268",National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-0753455]; Competitive State Wildlife Grant via U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Division of Federal Aid in Sportfish and Wildlife Restoration to the state of Delaware [CT U2-5-R-1]; Competitive State Wildlife Grant via U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Division of Federal Aid in Sportfish and Wildlife Restoration to the state of Maryland [CT U2-5-R-1]; Competitive State Wildlife Grant via U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Division of Federal Aid in Sportfish and Wildlife Restoration to the state of Connecticut [CT U2-5-R-1]; Competitive State Wildlife Grant via U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Division of Federal Aid in Sportfish and Wildlife Restoration to the state of Maine [CT U2-5-R-1]; Wilson Ornithological Society Louis Agassiz Fuertes Award; Univ. of Connecticut; Connecticut Museum of Natural History George Clark Jr and Manter Funds; Garden Club of America Frances M.

Such assemblages may be organized at the level of guilds rather than at the finer species level. In a ten-year study of assemblages of fish at One Tree Reef, Great Barrier Reef, we found species composition and the number of fish on a given lagoonal patch reef vary greatly across time (Sale and Douglas 1984; Sale et al. in preparation). The mean average proportional similarity of a reef's assemblage to itself at different times (censuses) is usually low at a value of around 0.5. This apparent variability may be ecologically irrelevant noise if organization is at the higher guild level. We have recast our database at the guild level to test this possibility. Thirteen guilds were defined by the diets, foraging habitats and times of the individual species comprising them. Similarity of an assemblage to itself at successive censuses was re-calculated using the number of individuals in each guild instead of the numbers in each species. This analysis yielded significantly higher levels of similarity (P<0.01) among censuses. To test whether this increase in similarity was due solely to the smaller number of categories used to calculate the similarity indices, 5 sets of randomly generated guilds were constructed using a Monte Carlo approach. No significant difference (P>0.05) was found between the average similarity among censuses when assemblages were classified into these null guilds and when they were classified according to the real guilds. These results indicate that shifting to the larger taxonomic scale of guilds does not reveal a significantly more persistent assemblage structure than that revealed when analysis is at the smaller scale of species. There is no evidence of an underlying organization of these assemblages at the guild level.","UNIV NEW HAMPSHIRE, CTR MARINE BIOL, DURHAM, NH 03824 USA","SALE, PF (corresponding author), UNIV NEW HAMPSHIRE, DEPT ZOOL, DURHAM, NH 03824 USA.",,"Sale, Peter/AAM-5414-2020",,,,,55,23,23,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0722-4028,1432-0975,,CORAL REEFS,Coral Reefs,SEP,1992,11,3,,,,,147,154,,10.1007/BF00255469,,,8,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,JR082,WOS:A1992JR08200007,,,,,2021-09-27,

When nesting aggregations are close to one another density-dependent competition is likely to be high, potentially promoting foraging segregation (i.e. neighbouring colonies may segregate to search for food in different areas). However, little is known about spatial segregation in foraging behaviour between closely adjacent colonies, particularly in species that are wide-ranging foragers. Here, we tested for foraging segregation between two sub-colonies of a wide-ranging seabird, Cory's shearwater Calonectris borealis, separated by only 2 km, on a small Island in the North Atlantic. During the 2010 chick-rearing period, 43 breeding adults of both sexes were simultaneously sampled at both sub-colonies. A GPS logger was deployed on each individual and removed after several foraging trips at sea. Blood samples (plasma and red blood cells) were collected from each tracked individual for stable isotope analysis. Results indicated partial spatial segregation between the two sub-colonies during local foraging trips (i.e. those of a parts per thousand currency sign1 day duration and 216 km from the colony) accounting for 84.2 % of all trips recorded. The location of the breeding sub-colony influenced the direction of travel of birds during local trips resulting in sub-colony-specific foraging areas. Although the oceanographic conditions associated with the foraging range of the two sub-colonies differed, no differences were found in the habitat exploited and in their estimated diets. This suggests that birds concentrated their feeding activity in patches of similar habitat and prey during the chick-rearing period.","[Ceia, Filipe R.; Paiva, Vitor H.; Ceia, Ricardo S.; Marques, Joao C.; Ramos, Jaime A.] Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, Marine & Environm Res Ctr IMAR CMA, P-3004517 Coimbra, Portugal; [Hervias, Sandra] BirdLife Int Partner, SPEA Portuguese Soc Study Birds, Lisbon, Portugal; [Garthe, Stefan] Univ Kiel, Res & Technol Ctr FTZ, Busum, Germany","Ceia, FR (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, Marine & Environm Res Ctr IMAR CMA, P-3004517 Coimbra, Portugal.",ceiafilipe@zoo.uc.pt,"Parejo, Sandra Hervias/AAF-6214-2020; Ceia, Filipe R./A-2196-2012; Paiva, Vitor H./J-1092-2019; Ramos, Jaime A./B-6616-2018; Hervias-Parejo, Sandra/K-4917-2017; dos Santos Ceia, Ricardo Rafael/C-3094-2019; MARQUES, JOAO CARLOS/L-9478-2014","Parejo, Sandra Hervias/0000-0002-5377-3619; Ceia, Filipe R./0000-0002-5470-5183; Paiva, Vitor H./0000-0001-6368-9579; Ramos, Jaime A./0000-0002-9533-987X; Hervias-Parejo, Sandra/0000-0002-5377-3619; dos Santos Ceia, Ricardo Rafael/0000-0001-7078-0178; MARQUES, JOAO CARLOS/0000-0001-8865-8189","Foundation for Science and Technology (Portugal)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology; European Social Fund (POPH, EU) [SFRH/BD/64558/2009]; LIFE project Safe Islands for Seabirds [LIFE07 NAT/P/000649]","This research was co-sponsored by the Foundation for Science and Technology (Portugal) and the European Social Fund (POPH, EU) through a PhD grant to Filipe R.

I added six Rana clamitans, eight Rana sphenocephala, eight Rana blairi, and 10 Bufo woodhousii to terrestrial enclosures shortly after metamorphosis and recaptured them during the following spring. All anurans from low-density ponds were significantly larger than those from high-density ponds, but these size differences did not significantly affect survival to or size at spring emergence. However, R. sphenocephata, R. blairi, and R. clamitans that survived to spring had been larger at metamorphosis on average than those that did not survive; in contrast, B. woodhousii that survived the winter were smaller at metamorphosis on average than those that did not survive. Carbaryl exposure affected mass at metamorphosis of R. clamitans and B. woodhousii that were added to enclosures, but this difference disappeared or did not increase by spring emergence. Overall, exposure to carbaryl during the larval period did not have any apparent effects on survival or growth during the terrestrial phase. In my study, anurans were able to offset small size at metamorphosis with terrestrial growth, although there was a trend of reduced overwinter survival for ranid species that metamorphosed at a smaller size.","Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; US Geol Survey, Columbia Environm Res Ctr, Columbia, MO 65201 USA","Boone, MD (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, 212 Pearson Hall, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",boonemd@muohio.edu,,,,,,30,74,74,0,33,SOC STUDY AMPHIBIANS REPTILES,ST LOUIS,"C/O ROBERT D ALDRIDGE, ST LOUIS UNIV, DEPT BIOLOGY, 3507 LACLEDE, ST LOUIS, MO 63103 USA",0022-1511,,,J HERPETOL,J.

Tetranychidae) and predatory mite (Acari: Phyto-seiidae) populations in eight vineyards in California in 2006 and 2007. Temperature of south-facing leaves increased significantly by 0.8 degrees C for every 1 0 degrees C increase in ambient air temperature, and by 5.3 degrees C for every one MPa drop in leaf water potential Peak population densities of Pacific spider mite, Tetranychus pacific-us McGregor, increased significantly with increasing frequency of leaf temperatures above 31 degrees C. In contrast, peak population densities of Willamette spider mite, Eotetranychus willametter (McGregor), showed no relationship with the frequency of leaf temperatures above 31 degrees C This differential relationship between the two mite species and high leaf temperatures is consistent with their upper thresholds for development, which are 40 degrees C for T pacificus and 31 degrees C for E willametter, as identified in a previous study. Predatory mite population densities showed no relationship with peak population densities of either spider mite species during the analysis period, but decreased with the frequency of leaf temperatures above 31 degrees C In addition, predatory mite population densities were significantly higher on south-facing than interior leaves after adjusting for the effect of leaf temperature. These results help to explain why outbreaks of T pacificus occur in warmer or water-stressed vineyards, whereas E willamettei develops higher populations in cooler or well-irrigated vineyards. In addition, these results suggest that regulated deficit irrigation should be implemented with caution, especially in those vineyards with a high risk of T. pacificus outbreaks.","[Stavrinides, Menelaos C.] Agr Res Inst, CY-1516 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Stavrinides, Menelaos C.; Daane, Kent M.; Mills, Nicholas J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lampinen, Bruce D.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Stavrinides, MC (corresponding author), Agr Res Inst, CY-1516 Nicosia, Cyprus.",,"Stavrinides, Menelaos/A-3082-2013","Stavrinides, Menelaos/0000-0002-6459-1941; Mills, Nicholas/0000-0001-8885-8674",Cyprus-America Scholarship; American Vineyard Foundation; Viticulture Consortium West; California Raisin Marketing Board,"We thank Margarita Hadpstylli, Jennifer King, Ricky Lara, and the Daane laboratory at Kearney Agricultural Center for help with field and laboratory observations SUM Metcalf of University of California, Davis, helped with thermocouple setup for measuring leaf temperature.

We evaluated resource selection by the spiny rat (Thrichomys fosteri) in a heterogeneous habitat, disentangling the relative importance of habitat structure, escape cover, food availability, and intraspecific competition. The last 2 variables were estimated directly by explicitly incorporating their spatiotemporal variation in the model. We radiotracked 15 males and 5 females for a median of 10 days per month for 17 months. Used and available resources were estimated at the home-range scale by intersecting the radiotracking locations (used) and random points (available) with resource maps that were either temporally static (measured only once; palm density and bromeliad cover) or dynamic (with temporal variation; arthropod biomass and conspecific abundance). We performed a resource selection function analysis using conditional logistic regression stratified by each individual location. Within their home ranges, spiny rats selected areas with high bromeliad cover and arthropod biomass. There was a negative interaction between conspecific abundance and arthropod biomass. We showed that resource selection by individuals takes into account multiple resources that vary in space and time. Individuals tended to select areas with high escape cover and high food availability balanced by low intraspecific competition.","[Antunes, Pamela C.; Fernandez, Fernando A.

We review characteristics of these prey subsidies and their strong direct and indirect effects on consumers and recipient food webs. 2. Fluxes of terrestrial invertebrates to streams can provide up to half the annual energy budget for drift-feeding fishes such as salmonids, despite the fact that input occurs principally in summer. Inputs appear highest from closed-canopy riparian zones with deciduous vegetation and vary markedly with invertebrate phenology and weather. Two field experiments that manipulated this prey subsidy showed that it affected both foraging and local abundance of stream fishes. 3. Emergence of adult insects from streams can constitute a substantial export of benthic production to riparian consumers such as birds, bats, lizards, and spiders, and contributes 25-100 % of the energy or carbon to such species. Emergence typically peaks in early summer in the temperate zone, but also provides a low-level flux from autumn to spring in ice-free streams. This flux varies with in-stream productivity, and declines exponentially with distance from the stream edge. Some predators aggregate near streams and forage on these prey during periods of peak emergence, whereas others rely on the lower subsidy from autumn through spring when terrestrial prey are scarce. Several field experiments that manipulated this subsidy showed that it affected the short-term behaviour, growth, and abundance of terrestrial consumers. 4. Reciprocal prey subsidies also have important indirect effects on both stream and riparian food webs. Theory predicts that allochthonous prey should increase density of subsidised predators, thereby increasing predation on in situ prey and causing a negative indirect effect via apparent competition. However, short-term experiments have produced either positive or negative indirect effects. These contrasting results may be due to characteristics of the subsidies and individual consumers, but could also result from differences in experimental designs. 5. New study approaches are needed to better determine the direct and indirect effects of reciprocal prey subsidies. Experiments coupled with comparative research will be required to measure their effects on individual consumer fitness and population demographics. Future work should investigate whether reciprocal prey fluxes stabilise linked stream-riparian ecosystems, explore how landscape context affects the magnitude and importance of subsidies, and determine how impacts of human disturbance can propagate between streams and riparian zones via these trophic linkages. Study of thesereciprocal connections is helping to define a more holistic perspective of catchments, and has the potential to shape new directions for ecology in general.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Fishery & Wildlife Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Baxter, CV (corresponding author), Idaho State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stream Ecol Ctr, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA.",baxtcold@isu.edu,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009; Fausch, Kurt D/A-8849-2010",,,,,153,717,739,11,506,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Laboratory microcosm experiments were conducted to characterize the feeding strategies of Ae. sierrensis larvae in the presence of multiple resource types (free-swimming protozoa and substrate-bound particulate material). In our experiment, we quantified the effects of varying instar numbers and profile, resource type, and refuge size on predation of protozoa. Refugia were explicitly modeled in our microcosms, representing the interstitial spaces of leaf litter and the wood lining of natural tree holes. Results from these microcosm experiments suggested that: (1) Even in the absence of larvae, the majority of protozoa resided in the small-volume, resource-rich refugia. There was, however, a strong nonlinear and negative relationship between larval densities in the upper compartment and the protozoan densities in the refuge, suggesting that there was continual movement of protozoa between the two spaces. (2) Fourth instars harvested resources by filter-feeding at a higher rate than second instars. (3) As the level of substrate-bound particulate food was increased, the predation pressure by filter-feeding on the protozoa decreased. (4) As the refuge volume increased, the predation pressure on the protozoa decreased. We constructed a three-state-variable mathematical model describing the generalist feeding behavior of Ae. sierrensis larvae. The model system, with constant predator densities and two prey groups, exhibited full cooperativity; i.e., an increase in protozoa density resulted in a shift toward predation by filter feeding, while an increase in substrate-bound resources resulted in a shift toward predation by browsing. This indirect mutualism is mechanistically distinct from previously published systems and provides a potential mechanism for protozoan persistence in the presence of larval predation.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Environm Hlth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Western Washington Univ, Dept Math, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA","Eisenberg, JNS (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Environm Hlth Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,"Schreiber, Sebastian/0000-0002-5481-4822",,,,42,28,28,1,19,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,APR,2000,81,4,,,,,921,935,,10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0921:GFBOAS]2.0.CO;2,,,15,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,302EB,WOS:000086351500005,,,,,2021-09-27,

The three populations showed large-scale movements over deep oceanic waters near the Subantarctic Front, with generally little individual variation. The two neighboring populations of Eastern Rockhopper Penguins showed strikingly distinct distribution in space, while foraging in similar habitats and at the same trophic level (crustacean-eaters). In contrast, Northern Rockhoppers showed marked spatial overlap with birds of the sibling Eastern species, but their temporal delay of two months enabled them to effectively avoid significant overlap.

F. Muller, 1785) and its impact on competition outcome between Chlorella vulgaris Beijerinck, 1890 and Chlamydomonas globosa J. W. Snow, 1902. Freshwater green algae, Chlorella, have heavy cell walls and their size usually exceeds the lower limits of limb size of Ceriodaphnia. According to the optimal foraging theory, it is speculated that Ceriodaphnia would graze on the more exposed and relatively larger Chlamydomonas rather than on Chlorella, and this process would lead to small-sized Chlorella becoming a superior competitor in the presence of Ceriodaphnia. This work used Ceriodaphnia, Chlamydomonas globosa and Chlorella vulgaris to test this hypothesis. The grazing experiment showed that Ceriodaphnia preferred Chl. globosa to Ch. vulgaris, regardless of the concentration and relative abundance of these algae. The decrease in relative abundance of high-quality Chlamydomonas in Chlamydomonas-Chlorella assemblages did not diminish the grazing efficiency of Ceriodaphnia on this algal species, but increased the selectivity of small-sized cells of Chlorella. However, when the concentration of Chlamydomonas was extremely high, the grazing of Ceriodaphnia on Chlamydomonas decreased. In competition experiments, it was observed that the presence of Chlamydomonas restrained the growth potential of Chlorella; however, the introduction of Ceriodaphnia into the competing environment weakened this influence and to some extent enhanced the growth ability of Chlorella. The different densities of Ceriodaphnia had an obvious influence on the competition outcome between Chlamydomonas and Chlorella.","Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Biol, Antakya, Turkey","Tellioglu, A (corresponding author), Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Biol, Antakya, Turkey.",atellioglu69@gmail.com,"Tellioglu, Ayda/AAY-1586-2020","Tellioglu, Ayda/0000-0002-4528-5834",,,,62,1,1,1,21,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0011-216X,1568-5403,,CRUSTACEANA,Crustaceana,DEC,2013,86,13-14,,,,,1550,1563,,10.1163/15685403-00003246,,,14,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,275FD,WOS:000328660800003,,,,,2021-09-27,

It has been suggested that zooplankton (Daphnia) faced with this trade-off distribute vertically according to an Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) with Costs. An experiment has been designed to test the density (competition) dependence of the vertical distribution as this is a basic assumption of IFD theory. Results: Experiments were performed in large, indoor mesocosms (Plankton Towers) with a temperature gradient of 10 degrees C and a deep-water algal maximum established below the thermocline. As expected, Daphnia aggregated at the interface between the two different habitats when their density was low. The distribution spread asymmetrically towards the algal maximum when the density increased until 80% of the population dwelled in the cool, food-rich layers at high densities. Small individuals stayed higher in the water column than large ones, which conformed with the model for unequal competitors. Conclusion: The Daphnia distribution mimics the predictions of an IFD with costs model. This concept is useful for the analysis of zooplankton distributions under a large suite of environmental conditions shaping habitat suitability. Fish predation causing diel vertical migrations can be incorporated as additional costs. This is important as the vertical location of grazing zooplankton in a lake affects phytoplankton production and species composition, i.e. ecosystem function.","Max Planck Inst Limnol, Dept Physiol Ecol, D-24302 Plon, Germany","Lampert, W (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Limnol, Dept Physiol Ecol, Postfach 165, D-24302 Plon, Germany.",lampert@mpil-ploen.mpg.de,,,,,,44,45,47,0,23,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1741-7007,,BMC BIOL,BMC Biol.,APR 6,2005,3,,,,,,,,10,10.1186/1741-7007-3-10,,,12,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,026UD,WOS:000236367000001,15813974,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-27,

From hunter-gatherers through to Neolithic societies-and particularly in contemporary industrialised countries-humans have (voluntarily or involuntarily) provided other animals with food, often with a high spatio-temporal predictability. Nowadays, as much as 30-40% of all food produced in Earth is wasted. We argue here that predictable anthropogenic food subsidies (PAFS) provided historically by humans to animals has shaped many communities and ecosystems as we see them nowadays. PAFS improve individual fitness triggering population increases of opportunistic species, which may affect communities, food webs and ecosystems by altering processes such as competition, predator-prey interactions and nutrient transfer between biotopes and ecosystems. We also show that PAFS decrease temporal population variability, increase resilience of opportunistic species and reduce community diversity. Recent environmental policies, such as the regulation of dumps or the ban of fishing discards, constitute natural experiments that should improve our understanding of the role of food supply in a range of ecological and evolutionary processes at the ecosystem level. Comparison of subsidised and non-subsidised ecosystems can help predict changes in diversity and the related ecosystem services that have suffered the impact of other global change agents.","[Oro, Daniel; Genovart, Meritxell; Tavecchia, Giacomo; Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro] IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Populat Ecol Grp, Esporles 07190, Spain; [Fowler, Mike S.] Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro] Univ A Coruna, Depto Biol Anim, Coruna 15071 A, Spain","Oro, D (corresponding author), IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Populat Ecol Grp, Esporles 07190, Spain.",d.oro@uib.es,"Oro, Daniel/H-4208-2012; Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro/G-4522-2016; Genovart, Meritxell/L-4873-2014; Tavecchia, Giacomo/N-3961-2014","Oro, Daniel/0000-0003-4782-3007; Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro/0000-0001-8009-4331; Genovart, Meritxell/0000-0003-2919-1288; Tavecchia, Giacomo/0000-0001-5435-2691",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [CGL2012-34125]; FEDER (Balearic Government),"Michel Kaiser, Kees Camphuysen, Pepe Tella, Gilles Gauthier, Antoni Margalida, Juan Jimenez, Nacho Munilla and Xavier Querol kindly provided helpful comments and data on different PAFS and climatic cycles.

We quantified tadpole activity, growth, and relative morphology and found widespread differences in species responses to predator cues and reduced food. We detected pervasive phylogenetic signals in traits within each environment, but the phylogenetic signal was much less common in the trait plasticities. Among different models of continuous character evolution, Brownian Motion and Ornstein Uhlenbeck models provided better fits to the data than the Early Burst model. Tadpole activity level in predator environments had much higher evolutionary rates than in the control and reduced-food environments; we did not see this pattern in the other traits. In comparing traits versus trait plasticities, activity evolved much faster than the plasticity of activity whereas morphological traits evolved much slower than morphological plasticities.

One possible cause is that breeding areas are becoming less open because of tall trees and other factors. The effects of tree lines are generally studied by means of transversal studies spanning a short period of time. We report on a longitudinal field study from 1993 to 2010 into the breeding densities of Eurasian Oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus),Northern Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus),Black-tailed Godwit (Limosa limosa)and Common Redshank (Tringa totanus)in the Demmerik polder, the Netherlands. One part of this polder, a nature reserve, has an older tree line, while two agricultural parts are divided by a newly developing tree line. As the tree line in the agricultural parts was developing, foraging families of Greylag Goose (Anser anser)showed a strong increase in only one of these parts during the breeding season. During the same period, the density of avian predators also increased in the whole polder. Analysis shows waders avoid trees in both situations: with an existing tree line (a static situation) and with a growing tree line (a dynamic situation). We investigated the possible role of geese and avian predators in explaining the decline in density of breeding wader meadow birds, by systematic comparison of several different models. In these models, the effect of the growing tree line has the greatest impact on breeding meadow birds. Models with geese describe the trends of breeding wader meadow birds better than those including avian predators, but since these two variables, geese and avian predators, are confounded, no definitive conclusion can yet be drawn. Potential explanations of and functional mechanisms behind the strong decline in breeding meadow bird populations in this area are discussed.","[Tamis, Wil L.

Zoological Studies 49(4): 437-452. Green turtles Chelonia mydas nest year round at the Ras Al Hadd Nature Reserve, Oman, with a distinct lower-density nesting season from Oct. to May, and a higher-density nesting season from June to Sept. On these beaches, the main predators of turtle eggs and hatchlings are foxes Vulpes spp., wolves Canis lupus arabs, and wild cats Felis spp. and Caracal caracal schmitzi. During 1999-2001, both the nesting behavior of these turtles and the diets of foxes (the main predator on the beaches) were investigated, and we tested whether female turtles were able to avoid/reduce predation pressure on their eggs and hatchlings on the nesting grounds. Elsewhere in the region and globally, foxes are known to feed on rodents, lizards, birds, and insects, but at Ras Al Hadd, their diet is basically composed of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings (comprising about 95% in volume), with smaller contributions from other marine invertebrates (mostly ghost crabs Ocypode spp. and large gastropods), although they also sporadically ingested birds and lizards. The ability to adapt to a diet of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings, on these beaches, is certainly a factor behind the success of this carnivore community in the arid lands of the Arabian Peninsula. Field experiments indicated that nesting sea turtles recognized both natural predators and humans as threats to their offspring, and this was reflected in modifications to their nesting behavior. In relatively undisturbed areas (by both natural predators and humans), sea turtle nest density was significantly higher, and nests were placed further away from the surf's edge, in contrast to results from relatively disturbed areas, where turtle nests were closer to the surf's edge, thus reducing the distance hatchlings had to travel when they emerge and begin their journey to the sea. Nesting turtles interrupted their nesting cycle if they sensed the presence of people or foxes, returning to the sea without laying a clutch. However, if they had already initiated oviposition when they sensed the presence of people and/or predators, they continued, although they significantly increased efforts to camouflage their nests. Other reasons behind nest site abandonment included sand collapsing events (critical during preparation of the egg chamber) and intraspecific competition for nest sites. These behavioral patterns of sea turtles result from their evolutionary adaptation to nesting on beaches, which surely played a role in their survival, but also highlight the importance of minimizing human disturbance and activities on turtle nesting beaches. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/49.4/437.pdf","[Mendonca, Vanda Mariyam] EI EMC Int, Sur 411, Oman; [Al Saady, Salim; Al Kiyumi, Ali] Minist Environm & Climate Affairs, Muscat 113, Oman; [Mendonca, Vanda Mariyam; Erzini, Karim] Univ Algarve, Algarve Marine Sci Ctr CCMAR, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal","Mendonca, VM (corresponding author), Rua Joao Coutinho Pais,Lote 23-2EF, P-8700240 Olhao, Portugal.",drvandamendonca@mail.seaturtle.org,"Mendonca, Vanda Maria Domingos/P-3441-2017; Erzini, Karim/M-5216-2013; stud, zool/G-4030-2011","Mendonca, Vanda Maria Domingos/0000-0002-8007-0898; Erzini, Karim/0000-0002-1411-0126; ","Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education of Portugal [PRAXIS XXI/BPD/16317/98]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF)","The 1st author was supported by a 3 yr (1998-2001) postdoctoral research fellowship (ref.

Studies addressing such communities in the karst springs have rarely examined springheads, and have ignored intermittent springs. During high flow conditions the stygophilic crustaceans are flushed to the surface of a temporary stream Krcic where microbial mats prevent their drift and enables their successful retreat into underground in the periods of drought. The objective of this study was to characterize the microbial mat community of the Krcic Spring as a shelter for S. ambulans during strong current and high water level. Representative samples for diatom and cyanobacterial species identification and composition, as well as the fresh mat material for potential animal activity and cyanobacterial phylogenetic analysis were collected. The most dominant diatom was Achnanthidium minutissimum, whilst Fragilaria capucina, Meridion circulare, Navicula cryptocephala and Nitzschia palea had abundance greater than 0.5%. Morphological observations of cyanobacteria revealed that Phormidium favosum was the most dominant, with Hydrocoleum muscicola as a subdominant. Cyanobacterial phylogenetic relationship revealed two distinct clusters: ?(i) Phormidium cluster, confirming morphological observations in both winter and spring samples, and ?(ii) Wilmottia cluster, a first report for Croatia and found exclusively in the winter sample. Laboratory observations revealed a small stygophilic amphipod S. ambulans, hiding and feeding inside the pockets of fresh microbial mat. The intermittent Krcic Spring as a predator-free and competitor-free ecosystem provides a spatiotemporal conformity between microbial mat and stygophilous amphipod.","[Zutinic, Petar; Gottstein, Sanja; Udovic, Marija Gligora; Plenkovic-Moraj, Andelka; Ternjej, Ivancica] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Rooseveltov Trg 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Petric, Ines; Kolda, Anamarija] Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Div Marine & Environm Res, Bijenicka Cesta 54, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Borojevic, Koraljka Kralj] 3 Minnesota Dr, Warrington WA5 3SY, Cheshire, England; [Kamberovic, Jasmina] Univ Tuzla, Fac Nat Sci & Math, Dept Biol, Univ 4, Tuzla 75000, Bosnia & Herceg","Zutinic, P (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Rooseveltov Trg 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",petar.zutinic@biol.pmf.hr,"Udovic, Marija Gligora/AAK-7730-2021; Gottstein, Sanja/K-3822-2014; Petric, Ines/AAC-1341-2021; Zutinic, Petar/AAM-2532-2020","Zutinic, Petar/0000-0002-9836-9636; Kamberovic, Jasmina/0000-0002-5408-1438; Gligora Udovic, Marija/0000-0002-1982-2528",project MULTISEK (Multimetric evaluation of crenobiocoenosis) - Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund [351-01/13-01/108]; project AQUA-HEALTH (Aquatic microbial ecology as an indicator of the health status of the environment) - Croatian Science Foundation [3494],"This research was supported by the projects MULTISEK (Multimetric evaluation of crenobiocoenosis) funded by the Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund (code: 351-01/13-01/108) and AQUA-HEALTH (Aquatic microbial ecology as an indicator of the health status of the environment) funded by the Croatian Science Foundation (code: 3494).

Tundra vole and singing vole populations were negatively associated, probably because of their very different habitat preferences. At low densities, experimental manipulation of food, cover and competing species on the same 18 grids revealed different effects on the arvicoline species. Abundance of tundra voles increased with supplemental food, but singing voles and collared lemmings showed no significant responses. Singing vole populations had a clear negative response, but tundra voles and collared lemmings had no significant response to removal of shrub cover. Similarly, collared lemmings showed no response to removal of tundra voles or singing voles, and tundra voles showed no response to removal of singing voles, but singing voles showed a negative response to removal of tundra voles. The apparent mutualistic relationship between tundra voles and singing voles probably resulted from an indirect effect via predation, i.e., more predation on singing voles when tundra voles were removed.

Natural seedbank, separated into two size classes, was placed in seed trays in the field at four different densities (1/16 x, 1/4 x, 1 x, and 2 x normal). Following exposure to granivory, the remaining seeds were weighed and germinated to test for community level effects. Only the 1 x and 2 x normal density plots were heavily foraged, and at both seed sizes, which suggests that the gerbils employed a quitting harvest rate rule. In support of our second prediction, the two species of gerbils tended to consume more of the larger seeds, particularly at higher densities. The mean number and total number of plant species that germinated in plots exposed to granivores was not significantly different from unexposed samples. At the community level however, there was no net association of germinated plant species in the four treatment groups exposed to granivores, but a significant net positive association in the unexposed control seedbank. Gerbil foraging on annual plant seedbank may thus subtly change the entire community structure (from positive to neutral), although not necessarily shift the species distributions significantly. Our results corroborate other studies involving artificial food types such as millet and suggest that foraging decisions may affect the plant community.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel","Lortie, CJ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",lortiec@interchange.ubc.ca,"lortie, christopher j/F-6241-2014; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","lortie, christopher j/0000-0002-4291-7023; Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",,,,38,8,12,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2000,90,2,,,,,399,407,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.900221.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,349EX,WOS:000089031600021,,,,,2021-09-27,

We hypothesized that aphids in the canopy can increase the abundance of ants on the forest floor, thus intensifying the impacts of ants on other arthropods on the forest floor. We tested this hypothesis in a deciduous temperate forest in Beijing, China. We excluded the aphid-tending ants Lasius fuliginosus from the canopy using plots of varying sizes, and monitored the change in the abundance of ants and other arthropods on the forest floor in the treated and control plots. We also surveyed the abundance of ants and other arthropods on the forest floor to explore the relationships between ants and other arthropods in the field. Through a three-year experimental study, we found that the exclusion of ants from the canopy significantly decreased the abundance of ants on the forest floor, but increased the abundance of beetles, although the effect was only significant in the large ant-exclusion plot (80*60 m). The field survey showed that the abundance of both beetles and spiders was negatively related to the abundance of ants. These results suggest that aphids located in the tree canopy have indirect negative effects on beetles by enhancing the ant abundance on the forest floor. Considering that most of the beetles in our study are important predators, the ant-aphid mutualism can have further trophic cascading effects on the forest floor food web.","[Zhang, Shuang; Zhang, Yuxin; Ma, Keming] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Zhang, S (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",mkm@rcees.ac.cn,"Zhang, Yuxin/A-8223-2008","Zhang, Yuxin/0000-0003-0968-6558","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30900185, 30870459]; Special Fund for Forestry-scientific Research in the Public Interest [200904005]; State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology [SKLURE2008-1-02]","This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (30900185, 30870459), Special Fund for Forestry-scientific Research in the Public Interest (200904005), and State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology Grant (SKLURE2008-1-02).

Few studies, however, have tested the importance of individual variation to factors affecting population dynamics (e.g., average individual growth rates, developmental rates, survivorship, etc.) using natural populations. We conducted a field experiment designed to test effects of larval density and individual variability in body size on growth and development of larval tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum). We performed our experiment in a natural sinkhole lake in central Arizona; experimental populations differing in density and initial variability in body size were held in nylon mesh enclosures. Effects of individual variability in size were examined independently of any effects due to mean body size of the population or total population biomass. Density affected growth rates and development to metamorphosis of experimental larvae in a manner consistent with other studies. Initial variability in body size did not affect larval growth rates or diets but did interact with density to affect survivorship and development: experimental larvae held with similarly sized individuals experienced lower survivorship and were metamorphosing earlier than experimental larvae held with variably sized individuals. These effects did not appear to be mediated by size-specific competitive abilities but may have been mediated by individual behavioral responses to size structure.

As cormorants nest in high densities on islands, they can affect benthic communities through nutrient runoff from colonies and may also induce trophic cascades through fish predation. Here, we describe fish, invertebrate, and algal communities, as well as algal growth and biomass accumulation, around colony and control islands along the Finnish coast to determine how cormorants affect communities through top-down and bottom-up processes. While cormorants did not affect the species richness or biodiversity of any trophic levels, there were differences in the community composition of pelagic fish between colony and control islands, and mesopredators perch Perca fluviatilis and ruffe Gymnocephalus cernua were less abundant near colonies. The abundance of several species correlated with cormorant abundance, density and colony age, indicating that these are essential factors in determining the strength of colony impacts. Filamentous algae tended to be more abundant and primary production was higher near older, denser colonies, likely due to nutrient enrichment from the colonies, which overwhelms top-down control. Consequent increased competition by filamentous algae probably explains the decrease in biomass of the foundation algal species Fucus vesiculosus near denser, more populated colonies. Cormorants can thus affect benthic communities through both top-down and bottom-up processes, with bottom-up impacts being locally concentrated near colony islands. The impacts can become more pronounced over time and with increasing cormorant populations, potentially leading to shifts in community composition and ecosystem functioning around cormorant colonies.","[Gagnon, Karine; Yli-Rosti, Juho; Jormalainen, Veijo] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turun 20014, Finland","Gagnon, K (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turun 20014, Finland.",karine.gagnon@utu.fi,"Gagnon, Karine/O-1514-2013; Jormalainen, Veijo/B-2073-2008","Gagnon, Karine/0000-0002-0971-7740; Jormalainen, Veijo/0000-0001-6346-2585",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [251102],"V.J. conceived and designed the experiments, with input from others.

Recovery in the field does not depend on the chemical's properties and type of exposure only, but it is strongly linked to important environmental variables and biological interactions as well. Yet, these remain only marginally considered in the European risk assessment of chemicals. Here, we use individual-based modelling to investigate how the environmental scenario affects Daphnia magna population recovery from chemical exposure. Simulation experiments were performed for chemicals with lethality levels ranging from 40% to 90% at different food and temperature conditions. The same toxicity levels were then tested in combination with biological interactions including predation or competition. Results show that for the same chemical effect strength, populations often exhibited different recovery times in a different environmental context. The interactions between the chemical and the environmental variables were the strongest determinants of population recovery. Most important, biotic interactions even induced opposite effects on recovery at low and at high mortality levels. Results of this study infer that no specific role can be attributed to any abiotic or biotic variable in isolation. We conclude that unless the complex interactive mechanisms between the different factors constituting the full environmental scenario are taken into account in risk assessment, we cannot achieve a complete understanding of recovery processes from chemical effects.

Several main trends in the economics of biodiversity are identified. First, biodiversity change has come to be analyzed largely through its impact on ecosystem services (in the sense of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment). Second, there has been a growing focus on factors that optimally lead to biodiversity decline, i.e., the benefits to be had from reducing the abundance of pests, predators, pathogens, and competitors. Third, increasing attention is being paid to two global drivers of biodiversity change, climate and global economic integration, and the effect they have on the distribution and abundance of both beneficial and harmful species. Fourth, there has been growing interest in the development of instruments to deal with the transboundary public good aspect of biodiversity, and in particular in the development of payments for ecosystem services. The paper identifies the influence of these trends on attempts to model the role of biodiversity in the production of goods and services.","Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Perrings, C (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, POB 874501, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",charles.perrings@asu.edu,,,,,,114,7,8,1,33,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Specifically, the invasive social wasp, Vespula pensylvanica, is native to western North America and has become naturalized in Hawaii, where it exerts pressures on native arthropod communities as a competitor and predator. As invasive species may alter the microbial and disease ecology of their introduced ranges, there is a need to understand the microbiomes and virology of social wasps. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbiome of V. pensylvanica samples pooled by colony across two geographically distinct ranges and found that wasps generally associate with taxa within the bacterial genera Fructobacillus, Fructilactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, and Zymobacter, and likely associate with environmentally-acquired bacteria. Furthermore, V. pensylvanica harbors-and in some cases were dominated by-many endosymbionts including Wolbachia, Sodalis, Arsenophonus, and Rickettsia, and were found to contain bee-associated taxa, likely due to scavenging on or predation upon honey bees. Next, we used reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR to assay colony-level infection intensity for Moku virus (family: Iflaviridae), a recently-described disease that is known to infect multiple Hymenopteran species. While Moku virus was prevalent and in high titer, it did not associate with microbial diversity, indicating that the microbiome may not directly interact with Moku virus in V. pensylvanica in meaningful ways. Collectively, our results suggest that the invasive social wasp V. pensylvanica associates with a simple microbiome, may be infected with putative endosymbionts, likely acquires bacterial taxa from the environment and diet, and is often infected with Moku virus. Our results suggest that V. pensylvanica, like other invasive social insects, has the potential to act as a reservoir for bacteria pathogenic to other pollinators, though this requires experimental demonstration.","[Rothman, Jason A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Loope, Kevin J.] Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30458 USA; [McFrederick, Quinn S.; Wilson Rankin, Erin E.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Rothman, JA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.; Loope, KJ (corresponding author), Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30458 USA.",rothmanj@uci.edu; kjloope@gmail.com,"Wilson Rankin, Erin E./J-7044-2014","Wilson Rankin, Erin E./0000-0001-7741-113X","United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA) Predoctoral Fellowship [2018-67011-28123]; USDA NIFA Postdoctoral Fellowship [201667012-24681]; USDA NIFA Hatch funds [CA-R-ENT-5109-H, CA-R-ENT5091-H]; United States National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1557163]","This work was supported by a United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA) Predoctoral Fellowship (Award No. 2018-67011-28123) to JAR, a USDA NIFA Postdoctoral Fellowship (201667012-24681) to KJL, USDA NIFA Hatch funds to QSM (CA-R-ENT-5109-H) and EWR (CA-R-ENT5091-H) and a United States National Science Foundation grant (DEB #1557163) to EWR.

We examined the evidence for this argument for Macrocystis pyrifera (giant kelp) forests in southern California. Others have concluded that forests in this region collapsed between 1950 and 1970 as a result of sea urchin grazing driven by overfishing of sea urchin predators (sheephead wrasse and spiny lobsters) and competitors (abalone), and that the kelp forests recovered but are currently sustained as a result of a commercial sea urchin fishery that began in the early 1970s. Our examination of the historical record, primary publications, and previously unpublished data showed that there was no widespread decline in the region between 1950 and 1970, but there were localised declines in mainland kelp forests near the rapidly growing cities of Los Angeles and San Diego. The preponderance of evidence indicates that kelp losses were caused primarily by large increases in contaminated sewage discharged into coastal waters, sedimentation from coastal development, and the 1957-1959 El Nino. Increases in active sea urchin foraging were most likely a secondary effect following dwindling food resources. The forests recovered when sewage treatment improved and sewage outfalls were relocated. The effects of fisheries were explored by correlation analysis between kelp canopy cover and commercial sea urchin landings, and among fisheries landings for sea urchins, abalone, sheephead and lobster. These correlations were generally insignificant, but were often confounded by differences in the spatial scale over which the data were collected as well as factors other than simple abundance that affect the fisheries. However, where area-specific data were available, the landings of sea urchins generally tracked kelp abundance, most likely because roe (gonad) development is directly related to food availability. A literature review showed that although sheephead and lobsters may control sea urchin abundance at small spatial scales within some sites, there is little evidence they do so over large areas. That abalone and sea urchins compete, such that sea urchins increased as a result of abalone harvesting, is largely conjecture based on their similar habitat and food utilization. This study shows that kelp forests in southern California did not collapse, and that declines in some coastal sites were caused primarily by degradation of water quality, increased sedimentation and contamination, and unfavorable oceanographic conditions. We conclude that management by species' protection or reserves will not be effective if poor habitat quality impacts the ability of giant kelp to survive and thrive. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The first focused on random sampling in three 9 m2 plots. The second tested distribution inside and outside of the macrophyte root zone at three sites within a lake. The aggregation patterns varied with both taxonomical groups and levels of spatial scale. Chironomids were aggregated in level of samples, particularly when 1 m2 plots were compared but they were randomly distributed at higher spatial levels. Oligochaetes were randomly distributed at lower levels but aggregated among sites. Red chironomids were aggregated at lower levels and randomly distributed among sites. Predatory chironomids were almost uniformly distributed, especially at lower densities. A triangular model was suggested for relating the aggregation patterns to major influencing factors in the community. Taxonomic composition, animal size and number were considered the basic characteristics of a benthic community, and the three relationships among them were suggested to determine the aggregation pattern. According to the model, chironomids were dominated by interspecific competition at lower levels and by environment at higher levels of the spatial scale Oligochaetes were always influenced by environment.

In 2011 and 2013, experiments were conducted at Los Banos, Laguna, Philippines, to compare arthropod communities in rice plots and on levees with and without vegetation strips. Vegetation strips included spontaneous weeds, sesame and okra (2011), or mung bean (2013). The plots were treated with one of three nitrogen levels and in one experiment were planted with planthopper-resistant (IR62) and susceptible (IR64) rice varieties. Parasitoids and predators of lepidopteran pests and of the ricebug, Leptocorisa oratorius, were more abundant in high-nitrogen rice plots where their prey/hosts also had highest densities. Planthoppers and leafhoppers were more abundant in low-nitrogen plots. Weedy and sesame/okra bunds provided habitat for a range of natural enemies including spiders, parasitoids and predatory bugs, but did not have higher pest numbers than cleared bunds. Higher abundances of the predator Cythorhinuslividipennis and higher parasitism of planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) eggs by Anagrus sp. were associated with sesame/okra bunds in late season rice plots. Mung bean also provided habitat for key predators and parasitoids that spilled over to adjacent rice; however, mung bean was also associated with higher numbers of lepidopteran and grain-sucking pests in the adjacent rice, albeit without increased damage to the rice. For ricebug in particular, damage was probably reduced by higher parasitoid:pest ratios adjacent to the vegetation strips. Varietal resistance and mung bean strips had an additive effect in reducing abundance of the planthopper Sogatella furcifera and the leafhopper Nephotettix virescens. Reduced numbers of these latter pests close to vegetation strips were often compensated for by other plant-sucking bugs, thereby increasing the intensity of potentially stabilizing interspecific interactions such as competition. We highlight the benefits of diversifying rice landscapes and the need to optimize vegetation strips, e.g., by including lepidopteran trap-plants, for intensive rice production systems.","[Horgan, Finbarr G.; Crisol Martinez, Eduardo] EcoLaVerna Integral Restorat Ecol, Kildinan T56CD39, Cork, Ireland; [Crisol Martinez, Eduardo] COEXPHAL Assoc Vegetable & Fruit Growers Almeria, C Esteban Murillo 3, La Mojonera 04746, Almeria, Spain; [Stuart, Alexander M.; Bernal, Carmencita C.; de Cima Martin, Elena; Almazan, Maria Liberty P.] Int Rice Res Inst, DAPO Box 7777, Manila 1301, Philippines; [Fame Ramal, Angelee] Univ Philippines, Sch Environm Sci & Management, Los Banos 4030, Laguna, Philippines","Horgan, FG (corresponding author), EcoLaVerna Integral Restorat Ecol, Kildinan T56CD39, Cork, Ireland.",f.horgan@ecolaverna.org; eduardocrisol@googlemail.com; a.stuart@irri.org; c.bernal@irri.org; eledecima@gmail.com; m.l.almazan@irri.org; angelee.ramal@gmail.com,,"Horgan, Finbarr/0000-0003-3796-667X",Global Rice Science Partnership (GRiSP),This research was funded by the Global Rice Science Partnership (GRiSP) under the directorship of Achim Dobermann for research into optimizing ecosystem services in rice production landscapes.,,80,8,8,3,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,OCT,2019,10,10,,,,,,,328,10.3390/insects10100328,,,28,Entomology,Entomology,JS8TI,WOS:000500573900022,31581452,"Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-27,

Many reef fish species decline in abundance as coral cover is lost, yet the mechanisms responsible for these losses are largely unknown. A commonly hypothesised cause of fish decline is the loss of shelter space between branches as dead corals become overgrown by algae. Here we tested this hypothesis by quantifying changes in predator-avoidance behaviour of a common damselfish, Pomacentrus moluccensis, before and after the death of their coral colony. Groups of P. moluccensis were placed on either healthy or degraded coral colonies, startled using a visual stimulus and their sheltering responses compared over a 7-week period. P. moluccensis stopped sheltering amongst the coral branches immediately following the death of the coral, despite the presence of ample shelter space. Instead, most individuals swam away from the dead coral, potentially increasing their exposure to predators. It appears that the presence of live coral rather than shelter per se is the necessary cue that elicits the appropriate behavioural response to potential predators. The disruption of this link poses an immediate threat to coral-associated fishes on degrading reefs.","[Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa; Bonin, Mary C.; Munday, Philip L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia","Bostrom-Einarsson, L (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia.; Bostrom-Einarsson, L (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",lisa.bostromeinarsson@my.jcu.edu.au,"Munday, Philip L/F-5443-2011; Jones, Geoffrey P./E-9306-2010; Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa/B-5436-2015","Munday, Philip L/0000-0001-9725-2498; Jones, Geoffrey P./0000-0002-6244-1245; Bostrom-Einarsson, Lisa/0000-0003-4814-9552",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council,"The authors are grateful for the logistical support of Mahonia Na Dari Conservation Centre, Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea.

In the present study, we examined the influence of coastal exploitation in terms of invertebrate harvesting and harbour activity on invertebrate community composition in subtropical seagrass meadows at Inhaca Island, Mozambique, in the Western Indian Ocean. There was a fivefold higher invertebrate density and biomass, and clearly higher invertebrate species richness, in the protected (control) site compared to the two exploited sites. The causes for the clear differences between protected and exploited sites were probably a result of (1) the directional outtake of large edible or saleable invertebrates (mostly molluscs) and the absence of boat traffic in the harvested site, and (2) harbour activities. Invertebrate community composition in the two exploited sites also differed (although less clear), which was likely due to inherent distinction in type of disturbance. Our findings revealed that protection of seagrass habitat is necessary and that disturbances of different origin might require different forms of management and conservation. Designing protected areas is however a complex process due to competition for use and space with activities such as invertebrate harvesting and harbours. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Diverse communities of smaller predators-mesopredators-often remain after apex predator removal. Despite concern that these mesopredators may be 'released' in the absence of the apex predator and exert negative effects on each other and on co-occurring prey, these interactions have been little studied. Here, we investigate the potential effects of competition and intraguild predation between red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and feral cats (Felis catus) in south-eastern Australia where the apex predator, the dingo (Canis dingo), has been extirpated by humans. We predicted that the larger fox would dominate the cat in encounters, and used a fox-removal experiment to assess whether foxes affect cat abundance, diet, home-range and habitat use. Our results provide little indication that intraguild predation occurred or that cats responded numerically to the fox removal, but suggest that the fox affects some aspects of cat resource use. In particular, where foxes were removed cats increased their consumption of invertebrates and carrion, decreased their home range size and foraged more in open habitats. Fox control takes place over large areas of Australia to protect threatened native species and agricultural interests. Our results suggest that fox control programmes could lead to changes in the way that cats interact with co-occurring prey, and that some prey may become more vulnerable to cat predation in open habitats after foxes have been removed. Moreover, with intensive and more sustained fox control it is possible that cats could respond numerically and alter their behaviour in different ways to those documented herein. Such outcomes need to be considered when estimating the indirect impacts of fox control. We conclude that novel approaches are urgently required to control invasive mesopredators at the same time, especially in areas where apex predators are absent.","[Molsher, Robyn] Dept Environm Water & Nat Resources, Kangaroo Isl, SA, Australia; [Newsome, Alan E.] CSIRO, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Newsome, Thomas M.; Dickman, Christopher R.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Newsome, Thomas M.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Newsome, Thomas M.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Newsome, Thomas M.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Newsome, TM (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Newsome, TM (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.; Newsome, TM (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Geelong, Vic, Australia.; Newsome, TM (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",tnew5216@uni.sydney.edu.au,"Dickman, Christopher/Q-4662-2019","Dickman, Christopher/0000-0002-1067-3730; Newsome, Thomas/0000-0003-3457-3256",Department of the Environment and Energy,"We gratefully acknowledge CSIRO and the Vertebrate Biocontrol CRC (now the Invasive Animals CRC) for access to the Burrendong study region and use of facilities, and Environment Australia (now the Department of the Environment and Energy) for additional funding.",,40,28,30,1,62,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JAN 9,2017,12,1,,,,,,,e0168460,10.1371/journal.pone.0168460,,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,EH5WO,WOS:000391843900009,28068378,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2021-09-27,

However, intermediate outcomes occur when individuals escape intraguild (IG) interactions with non-lethal injuries. While the effects of wounds for prey include compromised mobility and increased predation risk, the consequences of similar injuries among top predators are not well understood, despite the implications for species interactions. Using an amphibian IG predator, Ambystoma opacum (Caudata: Ambystomatidae), we examined associations between non-lethal injuries and predator body size, foraging strategy, microhabitat selection, and intraspecific agonistic interactions. Wounds were common among IG predators, generally increasing in frequency throughout larval ontogeny. Non-lethal injuries were associated with differences in predator body size and behavior, with injured predators exhibiting smaller body sizes, increased use of benthic microhabitats, reduced agonistic displays, and increased risk of intraspecific aggression. While such effects were not ultimately associated with reduced foraging success, non-lethal injury could contribute to niche partitioning between injured and healthy predators via habitat selection, but injured predators likely continue to exert predatory pressure on IG and basal prey populations. Our results indicate that studies of top-down population regulation should incorporate injury-related modifications to both prey and predator behavior and size structure.","[Mott, Cy L.] Valdosta State Univ, Dept Biol, Valdosta, GA 31698 USA; [Mott, Cy L.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Cooperat Wildlife Res Lab, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Steffen, Michael A.] Univ Tulsa, Dept Biol Sci, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA; [Steffen, Michael A.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA","Mott, CL (corresponding author), Valdosta State Univ, Dept Biol, 1500 North Patterson St, Valdosta, GA 31698 USA.",cy.mott@gmail.com,,,Delyte and Dorothy Morris Doctoral Fellowship,"We thank S.A.

We investigated a unique IGP example among predacious fungus Zoophagus sp. and two rotifers, the predacious Cephalodella gibba and the common prey Lecane inermis. We checked the influence of the fungus on its competitor C. gibba and their joint influence on shared prey L. inermis, and the impact of the competitive predator on the growth of predacious fungus. The experiment on grown mycelium showed that Zoophagus strongly, negatively influences the growth of C. gibba (intermediate consumer) whose number did not increase throughout the experiment. The intermediate consumer was also trapped by Zoophagus and become extinct when it was its only prey, whereas in the absence of the fungus and with unlimited access to prey, its number grew quickly. As only few C. gibba were trapped by fungi when common preys were present, competition for food seems to have stronger effect on intermediate consumer population than predation. The experiment with conidia of the fungus showed that intermediate consumer significantly limits the growth of Zoophagus by reducing the number of available prey. It was observed that although the fungus can trap C. gibba, the latter does not support its growth.

We experimentally evaluated the influence of grazing by zooplankton and by different predator groups on the abundance and biomass of phytoplankton and morphologically-based functional groups (MBFGs), in a subtropical floodplain shallow lake (Brazil). We tested if different grazing levels modify the structure of the phytoplankton, considering that higher zooplankton abundance reduces the abundance and biomass of phytoplankton and the MBFGs. We used five treatments (5 L) with different zooplankton abundance and five replicas to represent an increasing grazing gradient. Sampling of phytoplankton and zooplankton was carried out after 24 hours, in each treatment. The zooplankton abundance presented significant differences among treatments (F = 11.79; p < 0.01), showing the evident grazing gradient in the experiment. Rotifers dominated all the treatments, followed by copepods, although their abundance decreased at the end of the experiment. In contrast, cladoceran abundance increased. An inverse and significant relationship was observed between zooplankton and rotifer abundances and MBFG III abundance (beta = -0.85, p < 0.01; r(2) = 0.32; beta = -0.54; p < 0.01; r(2) = 0.29, respectively), showing an effective predator-prey interaction. Many positive and significant relationships were also observed among the grazers and the prey. The increase of the abundance and biovolume of phytoplankton was related to the bottom-up mechanisms, the rapid population growth of prey, and the short time of the experiment. The change in the MBFGs' contribution was related to the increase in the zooplankton and group abundance, grazer competition and exploitative competition among the MBFGs. The experiment contributes to the knowledge on an important part of the trophic dynamics among planktonic communities in subtropical floodplain shallow lakes.","[Fonseca da Silva, Joao Vitor; Bonecker, Claudia Costa] Univ Estadual Maringa, Programa Posgrad Biol Comparada, Ave Colombo 5790, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Baumgartner, Matheus Tenorio; Rodrigues, Luzia Cleide; Bonecker, Claudia Costa] Univ Estadual Maringa, Programa Posgrad Ecol Ambientes Aquat Continentai, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Miracle, Maria Rosa] Univ Valencia, Dept Microbiol & Ecol, ICBiBE, Burjassot, Valencia, Spain; [Dias, Juliana Deo] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Oceanog & Limnol, Natal, RN, Brazil","da Silva, JVF (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Maringa, Programa Posgrad Biol Comparada, Ave Colombo 5790, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil.",joaovitorbio@live.com,"Dias, Juliana D/B-3184-2013; Rodrigues, Luzia/AAB-2194-2021; Bonecker, Claudia C/D-5946-2013","Rodrigues, Luzia/0000-0002-0593-0931; Bonecker, Claudia C/0000-0003-4338-9012; Fonseca da Silva, Joao Vitor/0000-0002-1742-995X",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Nupelia (UEM); PELD/CNpq (site 6-PIAP); Proex/CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),"We thank Leilane Talita Fatoretto Schwind for substantially contributing to the improvement of the manuscript.

Hermit crabs were most common in rocky intertidal areas with cobbles and boulders, while many guarding pairs were observed on fronds of brown algae such as Sargassum confusum in Hakodate Bay, Japan. We examined three hypotheses explaining why the guarding pairs were most common on algae; (1) aggregation place for mature males and females to find mates, (2) avoidance of male-male combat, and (3) avoidance of predators. If solitary males and females climbed up algae, then many guarding pairs were observed after pairing, but only guarding pairs climbed up the algae after removing all crabs. Experiments in aquariums showed that the disturbance rate for guarding pairs due to male-male competition was lower on the algae than in boulder and rocky flat areas, and few disturbances were observed by predatory crabs in all habitat types. These results suggest that the guarding males climb up the fronds of algae to sequester guarded females from rival males and avoid male-male combat. This behavior could be considered as a male counter tactic against indirect female choice mediated by sex pheromones in which females release sex pheromones while guarded, attracting many rival males and inducing male-male competition.","[Kawaminami, Takuma] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries Sci, Marine Biol Lab, Hakodate, Hokkaido 0418611, Japan; [Goshima, Seiji] Hokkaido Univ, Marine Biol Lab, Fac Fisheries Sci, Hakodate, Hokkaido 0418611, Japan","Goshima, S (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Marine Biol Lab, Fac Fisheries Sci, Hakodate, Hokkaido 0418611, Japan.",goshima@fish.hokudai.ac.jp,,,,,,28,6,6,1,35,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",0289-0771,1439-5444,,J ETHOL,J.

However, patches consisting of older aphids received fewer eggs. The number of eggs laid decreased in response to the presence of conspecific eggs, and in response to the presence of 2-day old conspecific larvae.

It is well-established that apparent competition can result from changes in predator abundance or behavior caused by interactions with alternate prey, but no previous empirical study has demonstrated that apparent competition can also result from prey-induced changes in predator morphology. This trait-mediated alternative mechanism of apparent competition would expand the range of conditions under which apparent competition might occur in nature and identify new ways to generate or modify apparent competition in applied contexts. Here, as a proof of concept, we show that trait-mediated apparent competition can arise from inducible offenses and show how it operates using experiments involving three ciliates. When it feeds on Colpidium kleini, the intraguild predator Tetrahymena vorax increases in size to the extent that it can then consume Paramecium aurelia, an even larger prey. When feeding only on bacteria, however, Tetrahymena remains smaller and is unable to consume Paramecium. This trait-mediated indirect effect leads to the predatory exclusion of Paramecium, while Tetrahymena and Colpidium coexist. Developmental expansions such as those underlying the interactions observed in our study are not limited to ciliates, such as Tetrahymena, but occur among many diverse taxa and may have a surprising degree of influence over the structure and dynamics of food webs.","[Banerji, Aabir] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Morin, Peter J.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 07853 USA","Banerji, A (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",aabir.banerji@ieu.uzh.ch,,,School of Environmental and Biological Sciences; New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station,"We gratefully acknowledge Osamu Kishida, Jotaro Urabe, Peter Thrall, Rebecca Jordan, Mike Pace, Kevin Aagaard, Laura Chen, Jean Deo, Sean Hayes, Ruchi Patel, Jack Siegrist, Maria Stanko, Holly Vuong and Talia Young for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Predators can also evolve counter-defenses to increase the likelihood of successful attack. Investment in either trait can be costly, leading to a trade-off between the traits and other fitness components. Costs for defense have been shown experimentally to depend on environmental factors such as resource availability. This suggests that costs can increase with population size, rather than remaining constant as models often assume. Using a quantitative trait model with predator-prey coevolution, we investigate how both population and trait dynamics are affected by density-dependent prey defense cost (variable cost) vs. density-independent cost (fixed cost). We assume predator counter-defense cost is always density independent. We also investigate the effect of relative speeds of prey and predator evolution on population and trait dynamics, by varying a parameter that determines each population's additive genetic variance. For both models, increasing the speed of predator evolution always has a stabilizing effect on the dynamics, while increasing the speed of prey evolution (within a biologically reasonable range) is largely destabilizing. Within the plausible range of prey evolution speed, variable cost of prey defense is more stabilizing than fixed cost. Our results suggest that density-dependent costs of defense can have important effects on predator-prey dynamics, even when evolution is relatively slow. Our results might also help to explain why many real populations do not display predator-prey cycles.","[Tien, Rebecca J.; Ellner, Stephen P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Tien, RJ (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Math Biosci Inst, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",rtien@mbi.osu.edu,,,Mellon Foundation grant,"This article is based on work in Rebecca Tien's doctoral dissertation, submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell.

Yet biological analysis of such populations is often extremely time consuming, owing to abundance estimation by counting, measuring body size, or determining the investment into sexual versus asexual reproduction. An automated system for sampling and analyzing experimental rotifer populations is described. It relies on image analysis of digital photographs taken from subsamples of the culture. The system works completely autonomously for up to several weeks and can sample up to 12 cultures at time intervals down to a few hours. It allows quantitative analysis of female population density at a precision equivalent to that of conventional methods (i.e., manual counts of samples fixed in Lugol solution), and it can also recognize males, which allows detecting temporal variation of sexual reproduction in such cultures. Another parameter that can be automatically measured with the image analysis system is female body size. This feature may be useful for studies of population productivity and/or in competition experiments with clones of different body size. In this article, I describe the basic setup of the system and tests on the efficiency of data collection, and show some example data sets on the population dynamics of different strains of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus.","Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Limnol, A-5310 Mondsee, Austria","Stelzer, CP (corresponding author), Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Limnol, Mondseestr 9, A-5310 Mondsee, Austria.",claus-peter.stelzer@oeaw.ac.at,"Stelzer, Claus-Peter/F-3789-2018","Stelzer, Claus-Peter/0000-0002-6682-0904",FWFAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [P20735-B17]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 20735] Funding Source: researchfish,"I thank Johanna Schmidt and Anneliese Wiedlroither for technical assistance in the maintenance of chemostats and in microscopic analyses.

First instar larvae of a brown-eyed Drosophila tripunctata mutant were added to Agaricus bisporus mushrooms (10, 20 or 40 larvae/mushroom). The mushrooms were placed on dry. moist, or wet soil in ant-access and ant-exclusion treatment cups. The cups were placed in a woodland for 5 days where they were available to native flies for oviposition. We used ANOVA and MANOVA to measure the effects of our independent variables on the percentage of mutant larvae completing development and the number and diversity of native metamorphs. Ants visited wet soils (30% visited) more frequently than moist (20% visited) or dry soils (10% visited). and had stronger negative effects on larval survivorship and native metamorph abundance in wet and moist microenvironments. For example. ant predation reduced metamorph abundance by 60% on wet soil. 30% on moist soil, and only 8% on dry soil. Community composition also changed with soil moisture: a phorid (Dohrniphora sp.) dominated the dry soil mushrooms (49% of metamorphs). whereas drosophilids were more abundant in mushrooms on moist (63%) and wet soils (74%). The relatively low larval densities used in this experiment had no effect on either survivorship or diversity.

Four densities of fish were used, encompassing the biomass of fish in the lake. Bosmina was most abundant at low and medium fish densities (1.06 and 2.12 g fish biomass . m-3) and less abundant when fish were either absent or present at high density (3.71 g fish biomass . m-3). The unimodal response to predator abundance resulted from effects on both birth and death rates. Bosmina birth rates increased as fish biomass increased, in response to increasing food (phytoplankton) biomass. Death rates were highest at high fish biomass (because of fish predation) and in the absence of fish (because of predation by the dipteran Chaoborus, which was most abundant in the absence of fish). Size-frequency distributions revealed that fish eliminated the larger size classes of Bosmina, and mean carapace length of Bosmina populations was inversely proportional to fish biomass. Bosmina initiated reproduction at smaller size in the presence of fish than in their absence, and size at maturity was inversely proportional to fish biomass. Size at birth also tended to decrease with increasing fish biomass, but this trend was not as strong as that of size at maturity. Decreased size at maturity apparently allowed Bosmina individuals to reproduce before becoming vulnerable to fish predation. Flexibility in size at maturity, together with low abundance of invertebrate predators and large herbivores (which were preyed upon by fish), allowed Bosmina to become abundant in low and medium fish treatments. In the high fish treatment, mortality due to fish predation was too severe to be offset by decreased size at maturity, and Bosmina population density was low. The net response of Bosmina populations to fish predation results from interactive effects of predation on mortality, natality, and life history traits.","MIAMI UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,OXFORD,OH 45056",,,,,,,,32,21,21,1,3,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1993,95,1,,,,,70,80,,10.1007/BF00649509,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LR541,WOS:A1993LR54100011,28313314,,,,2021-09-27,

The descriptive studies, carried out in 1985 and 1989, revealed 36 clones in 150 habitats with individual ponds containing an average of 1.7 and a maximum of 5 clones. Distributional patterns and relative abundances of the clones were stable over the 4-yr interval. Three clones dominated the assemblage, comprising > 75% of the animals. One of these clones dominated saline habitats while the other two displayed a checkerboard distribution in low-salinity ponds. The latter distributional pattern appeared linked to the presence of a predatory copepod, Hesperodiaptomus arcticus, in some ponds. Manipulation experiments showed that abiotic variables (e.g., salinity) played a role in excluding clones from some habitats, but that many habitats were invasible by a broader spectrum of clones than was ever detected in them. Experiments showed that clones were ordinarily superior in their home environments, supporting the role of competition in limiting local richness. The experimental results were not totally congruent with the clones' natural distributions, as one clone became dominant in all of the low-salinity manipulation ponds. This outcome was reversed by introducing H. arcticus into ponds. The results confirm that clonal diversity is maintained by physical and biological variation in the system, and demonstrate that substantial taxon diversity can be sustained in the absence of marked ecological divergence.",,"WILSON, CC (corresponding author), UNIV GUELPH, DEPT ZOOL, GUELPH N1G 2W1, ONTARIO, CANADA.",,"Hebert, Paul DN/C-4161-2013; Wilson, Chris C/J-4851-2012","Hebert, Paul DN/0000-0002-3081-6700; Wilson, Chris C/0000-0002-9528-0652",,,,52,47,47,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,1992,73,4,,,,,1462,1472,,10.2307/1940690,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JE984,WOS:A1992JE98400027,,,,,2021-09-27,

Because wrens did not consume the egg contents, the behavior is not predation. Wrens attacked nests only within their own territories but often in vegetation not used as nesting substrate. Hence, the behavior probably does not represent attempts at cuckoldry or mate displacement, or competition for nest sites. Nest destruction may represent intraspecific or interspecific competition for (1) food or (2) predator-free nesting space. Evidence supporting these nonexclusive hypotheses are that food limits reproductive success in this population of wrens, and nest predation was density dependent in this population (natural nests surrounded by experimental nests showed higher predation rates than controls). Major predators included snakes, especially whipsnakes (Masticophis spp.), which are able to access Cactus Wren nests despite cholla (Opuntia spp.) spines.","ARIZONA STATE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, TEMPE, AZ 85287 USA",,,"simons, Lee/AAR-6686-2020",,,,,22,10,12,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0010-5422,1938-5129,,CONDOR,Condor,NOV,1990,92,4,,,,,855,860,,10.2307/1368721,,,6,Ornithology,Zoology,EP836,WOS:A1990EP83600005,,,,,2021-09-27,

Although many populations of Burbot Lota lota are declining in the species' native range, a nonnative population recently expanded into Flaming Gorge Reservoir (FGR), Wyoming-Utah, and threatens to disrupt predator-prey interactions within this popular sport fishery. To determine potential impacts on sport fishes, especially trophy Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush, we assessed the relative abundance of Burbot and quantified the potential trophic or food web impacts of this population by using diet, stable isotope, and bioenergetic analyses. We did not detect a significant potential for food resource competition between Burbot and Lake Trout (Schoener's overlap index = 0.13), but overall consumption by Burbot likely affects other sport fishes, as indicated by our analyses of trophic niche space. Diet analyses suggested that crayfish were important diet items across time (89.3% of prey by weight in autumn; 49.4% in winter) and across Burbot size-classes (small: 77.5% of prey by weight; medium: 76.6%; large: 39.7%). However, overall consumption by Burbot increases as water temperatures cool, and fish consumption by Burbot in FGR was observed to increase during winter. Specifically, large Burbot consumed more salmonids, and we estimated (bioenergetically) that up to 70% of growth occurred in late autumn and winter. Further, our population-wide consumption estimates indicated that Burbot could consume up to double the biomass of Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss stocked annually (>1.3 x 10(5) kg; >1 million individuals) into FGR. Overall, we provide some of the first information regarding Burbot trophic interactions outside of the species' native range; these findings can help to inform the management of sport fisheries if Burbot range expansion occurs elsewhere.","[Klobucar, Stephen L.; Saunders, W.

Mites commonly occur in phoretic association with this beetle, but little is known about their effects on beetle population dynamics. We assessed the effects of phoretic mites on the reproductive success of I. grandicollis using complementary correlative and manipulative approaches. First, we allowed beetles to colonize Pinus resinosa (Ait) logs from sites across Wisconsin, reared them in a common environment, and related the species identities and abundances of mites with beetle production from each log. We found a positive relationship between I. grandicollis abundance and the presence of five mite species, Histiostoma spp., Dendrolaelaps quadrisetus (Berlese), Iponemus confusus (Lindquist), Trichouropoda australis Hirschmann, and Tarsonemus spp. While the abundance of individual mite species was positively correlated with beetle abundance, assessments of mite community structure did not explain beetle reproduction. Next, we introduced beetles that either had a natural complement of mites or whose mites were mechanically reduced into logs, and compared reproductive success between these beetles. We found no difference in colonization rates or beetle emergence between mite-present and mite-reduced treatments. Collectively, these results suggest a correlative, rather than causal, link between beetle reproductive success and mite incidence and abundances. These mites and beetles likely benefit from mutually suitable environments rather than exerting strong reciprocal impacts. Although mites may have some effects on I. grandicollis reproductive success, they likely play a minimal role compared to factors such as tree quality, beetle predation, and weather.","[Pfammatter, Jesse A.; Raffa, Kenneth F.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Russell Labs 345, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Pfammatter, JA (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Russell Labs 345, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",pfammatter@wisc.edu,,,McIntire-Stennis [WIS01430]; University of Wisconsin-Madison College of Agricultural and Life Sciences,"Maggie Joyce, Ainsley McMaster, Lukas Brown, Kareem Malas, and Kirsten Martin (University of Wisconsin-Madison) assisted with field collections and colony maintenance.

However, it has been suggested that clonal encrusting organisms with unlimited attachment to the substratum do not rely heavily on microrefuges for post-larval survival, since they quickly outgrow refuges and then suffer partial rather than total mortality. Consequently, the larva of such organisms is predicted to show little selectivity at the time of settlement. This prediction, verified for some bryozoans and ascidians, has also been extrapolated to sponges despite the fact that there is virtually no field information on patterns of settlement and post-settlement mortality in this group. In the present study, we investigated patterns of settlement and juvenile mortality in 2 common Mediterranean encrusting sponges, Crambe crambe and Scopalina lophyropoda. We placed a set of grooved plates (providing microrefuges for larval settle ment) and a set of smooth plates (without refuges) in the natural community, mapped larval settlement on plates at 3 d intervals, and recorded the fate of each settled larva for 10 wk. The total number of larvae of C. crambe that settled on the plates was significantly higher than that of S. lophyropoda, and both species settled preferentially in the microrefuges of the grooved plates. On each of the grooved plates, larvae settled preferentially on the shaded sides of outer ridges, avoiding equivalent ridge sides that were highly exposed to Light. This pattern suggests that microrefuges are located by larvae on the basis of photic cues, The analysis of survival time revealed that survival of post-larval stages protected in grooves was higher in both species compared to unprotected post-larvae. The survival curve of the juveniles did not clearly follow an exponential model. Survival decreased more or less rapidly for the first 2 mo, but the chance of mortality was not markedly higher 1 wk after settlement than during subsequent weeks. Because we could not exert control over the various coincidental mortality factors that affected the sponges settled on the experimental plates, we tested the following hypotheses in the laboratory: (1) that the abundant echinoderms inhabiting these assemblages cause significant mortality by both unselective ingestion and abrasion, and (2) that microrefuges substantially reduce sponge vulnerability to this mortality factor. In this experiment, we investigated differences in mortality among small sponges as a function of microhabitat exploitation (sponges protected in grooves versus unprotected sponges on smooth surfaces) and the presence/absence of potential predators (the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, the starfish Echinaster sepositus). It was found that E. sepositus caused negligible mortality, irrespective of sponge microhabitat. In contrast, P. licidus caused significant mortality, indicating that bulldozing by urchins may have substantial negative effects on sponge recruitment in temperate hard-bottom communities where urchins are ubiquitous. Our results also indicate that exploitation of physical microrefuges, such as grooves and crevices, reduces, but does not prevent, sponge mortality due to bulldozing by urchins. The enhancement of juvenile survival in microrefuges has probably operated as a selective force, favoring larval mechanisms that facilitate selective settlement in refuges.","CSIC, Dept Aquat Ecol, E-17300 Blanes, Girona, Spain","Maldonado, M (corresponding author), CSIC, Dept Aquat Ecol, Camino de Santa Barbara S-N, E-17300 Blanes, Girona, Spain.",maldonado@ceab.csic.es,"Maldonado, Manuel/J-9331-2012; Uriz, Maria/J-9001-2012","Maldonado, Manuel/0000-0002-7447-4212; ",,,,60,56,59,0,13,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Experienced animals use information about social and physical environment to improve resources exploitation, tended to maintain positions within the preferred areas and reuse the environment that is often referred to as site fidelity. In this study, radio-telemetry was used to observe the movements of 98 adult brown trout, Salmo trutta, in oligotrophic streams with different population densities; to determine subpopulation site fidelity, 5,195 conspecifics from 14 subpopulations were individually tagged during spring and autumn. During a 7-year-long field study, we tested the hypothesis that brown trout individuals from subpopulations with high site fidelity would display lower movement. The hypothesis was supported, and reduced movement was further related to high subpopulation density in association with high slope indicating the physical environment-influenced movement. The probability of contact between individuals increased with subpopulation site fidelity and subpopulation density. No influence of food abundance on brown trout movement was found. Furthermore, increased body size predicted higher movement (and vice versa). The least movement occurred during the day and during the full moons.

In the low rocky intertidal zone of the Pacific Northwest, the chiton Katharina tunicata is closely associated with the canopy-forming alga Hedophyllum sessile. In a 27-month field experiment, I used experimental devices to mimic characteristics of the Hedophyllum canopy and monitored the abundance and physiology of Katharina to determine the mechanism behind this association. The data show that this association is due to selection of shaded microhabitats by Katharina, and that neither predation nor Hedophyllum per se influenced the distribution of the chiton. Exclusion of visual predators had no effect on chiton abundance, and tests of the effects of shade independent of Hedophyllum presence indicated that the shade produced by the alga was critical to the chiton. Seasonal fluctuations in levels of 70 kDa 0.16 X 10(-19) g) heat shock proteins (Hsp70), indicate that Katharina experience sublethal physiological stress during the spring and summer. The corresponding use of shaded areas during spring and summer low tides suggests that the chiton's distribution is limited during these seasons by the availability of refugia from sublethal abiotic stresses. Subtle variations in environmental conditions are also important to this association; the strength of the positive interaction varied annually, becoming more positive in warm summers (1998 and 2000) and neutral in a cooler summer (1999). On a finer scale, physiological measurements indicate that the response of chitons to summertime temperatures depends on both absolute temperature change and the animal's recent thermal history. In particular, the seasonal onset of daytime low tides in the spring is associated with increased Hsp70 levels, indicating that this is a significant physiological event for Katharina. The importance of facultative positive interactions that allow consumers to escape from sublethal abiotic stresses will likely be variable in time but can have large impacts on communities both by affecting the small-scale distribution of consumers over the short term and potentially by affecting the persistence of organisms over the long term.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Burnaford, JL (corresponding author), Univ Puget Sound, Dept Biol, 1500 N Warner St 1088, Tacoma, WA 98416 USA.",jburnaford@ups.edu,,,,,,67,42,43,2,151,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2004,85,10,,,,,2837,2849,,10.1890/03-0113,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,867LS,WOS:000224844700023,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, cormorants have a wettable plumage, which leads to poor insulation. Despite this, these birds are apparently highly successful predators in most aquatic ecosystems. We studied the theoretical influence of water temperature, dive depth, foraging techniques, and prey availability on the energetic costs of diving, prey search time, daily food intake, and survival in foraging, nonbreeding great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo). Our model was based on field measurements and on data taken from the literature. Water temperature and dive depth influenced diving costs drastically, with predicted increases of up to 250% and 258% in males and females, respectively. Changes in water temperature and depth conditions may lead to an increase of daily food intake of 500-800 g in males and 440-780 g in females. However the model predicts that cormorant foraging parameters are most strongly influenced by prey availability, so that even limited reduction in prey density makes birds unable to balance energy needs and may thus limit their influence on prey stocks. We discuss the ramifications of these results with regard to foraging strategies, dispersal, population dynamics, and intraspecific competition in this avian predator and point out the importance of this model species for our understanding of foraging energetics in diving endotherms.","Inst Meereskunde, D-24105 Kiel, Germany","Gremillet, D (corresponding author), Inst Terr Ecol, Banchory Res Stn, Hill Brathens, Banchory AB31 4BY, Kincardine, Scotland.",,"Gremillet, David/W-1946-2018","Gremillet, David/0000-0002-7711-9398",,,,57,34,39,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

However, increasing amounts of the global terrestrial surface are homogenized by agriculture (which covers nearly 50% of terrestrial vegetated land surface) and other anthropogenic activities. Agricultural intensification leads to highly simplified biotic communities for many taxa, which may alter natural selection through biotic selective agents. In particular, the presence of crops may alter selection on traits of closely related wild relatives via shared mutualists and antagonists such as pollinators and herbivores. We asked how the presence of crop sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) alters natural selection on reproductive traits of wild sunflowers (Helianthus annuus texanus). Across two years and multiple sites, we planted replicated paired populations of wild H. a. texanus bordering sunflower crop fields versus approximately 2.5 km away. We measured fitness, floral traits, and interactions of the plants with insect pollinators and seed predators. We found limited evidence that proximity to crop sunflowers altered selection on individual traits, as total or direct selection differed by proximity for only three of eleven traits: ray length (a marginally significant effect), Isophrictis (Gelechiidae, moth) attack, and Neolasioptera (Cecidomyiidae, midge) attack. Direct (but not total) selection was significantly more heterogenous far from crop sunflowers relative to near crop sunflowers. Both mutualist pollinators and antagonist seed predators mediated differences in selection in some population-pairs near versus far from crop sunflowers.

Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of herbivory of zooplankton and omnivorous fish in periphytic algae of lake ecosystems. Based on prediction of grazer:prey size ratio, we tested that periphytic algal biomass and density will be lower in the fish treatments. Based on prediction of the sizes-elective predation, size-efficiency hypothesis, and general allometric equations, and that both herbivores will feed with distinct mode, we tested the hypothesis that periphytic algal functional diversity will be higher in the mixed treatment. There were four treatments (Control, Ti -zooplankton, T2-fish, T3-zooplankton+-fish). We evaluated algae biomass, density, functional traits, functional diversity, and the herbivory effect. Our results show that the presence of both herbivores were related to higher functional diversity, lower density values, and prostrate periphytic algae, and in T2 occurs higher periphytic algae biomass via nutrient facilitation. Fish was responsible for the higher consumer effect size, and was more important modifier than zooplankton of the periphytic algae community. The greater variation in producer species traits was directly related to mixed foraging patterns of herbivores together, which allow rare species to persist, decreasing the dominance of stronger competitive species.","[Dunck, Barbara] Univ Fed Para, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Belem, PA, Brazil; [Amaral, Diogo Castanho; Fernandes, Ubirajara Lima; Santana, Natalia Fernanda; Lopes, Taise Miranda; Rodrigues, Liliana] Programa Posgrad Ecol Ambientes Aquat Continentai, Maringa, PR, Brazil; [Rodrigues, Liliana] Univ Estadual Maringa, Dept Biol, Lab Algas Perifit, Nucleo Pesquisa Limnol Ictiol & Aquicultura, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Dunck, Barbara] Univ Fed Para, Inst Ciencias Biol, Rua Augusto Correa 01, BR-66075110 Belem, Brazil","Dunck, B (corresponding author), Univ Fed Para, Inst Ciencias Biol, Rua Augusto Correa 01, BR-66075110 Belem, Brazil.",dunck.barbara@gmail.com,"Dunck, Barbara/K-5743-2015; Fernandes, Ubirajara/Q-4721-2017","Dunck, Barbara/0000-0003-0608-0614; Fernandes, Ubirajara/0000-0001-9541-051X; Rodrigues, Liliana/0000-0001-5902-6203",Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),"We would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for excellent comments that substantially improved this paper.

Recently, strong evidence for access to mammoth meat has been described at the Pit 1 locality. At the la Mina and el Forn excavation areas, little evidence exists for the anthropogenic processing of macromammals. However, the presence of humans is recorded, and the available evidence suggests these populations had access to several interesting resources. By analysing and comparing five separate assemblages at Barranc de la Boella, we assess the fluctuating presence of hominins and carnivores and the levels of competition among predators in each assemblage. Our analysis reveals different levels of competition intensity during the formation of assemblages when hominin groups were present, as evidenced by the abundance and diversity of stone artefacts. The analyses of skeletal component ratios indicate several competitive contexts, and the greatest presence of hominin groups is associated with the most competitive scenarios. The palaeoenvironment at Barranc de la Boella was rich in resources that hominins could exploit. The presence of hominin and carnivore groups appears to have been higher in levels with more inferred competition. This scenario supports prior research that concludes that carnivore abundance and highly competitive contexts were two constants in the lives of these hominin groups. Thus, the criteria determining whether hominins could inhabit a given landscape were most likely related to the presence or absence of resources, such as animal resources, water and raw materials, rather than the dynamics of the carnivore populations, to which the hominins were able to become habituated.

We experimentally tested these predictions in three aquatic food web configurations subjected to either high or low nutrient additions. The results were structured by viewing the systems as either food chains or webs and showed that trophic level biomass increased with enrichment, which contradicts food chain theory. However, within each trophic level, food web configuration affected the extent to which different functional groups responded to enrichment. By dividing trophic levels into functional groups, based on vulnerability to consumption, we were able to identify significant effects that were obscured when systems were viewed as food chains. The results support the prediction that invulnerable prey may stabilize trophic-level dynamics by replacing other, more vulnerable prey. Furthermore, the vulnerable prey, such as Daphnia and edible algae, responded as predicted by the paradox of enrichment hypothesis; that is, variability in population density increased with enrichment. Hence, by describing ecosystems as a matrix of food web interactions, and by recognizing the interplay between interspecific competition and predation, a more complete description of the ecosystem function was obtained compared to when species were placed into distinct trophic levels.","Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Persson, A (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",anders.persson@limnol.lu.se; lars-anders.hansson@limnol.lu.se; christer.bronmark@limnol.lu.se; per.lundberg@teorekol.lu.se; lars.pettersson@zooekol.lu.se; larry.greenberg@kau.se; anders.nilsson@zooekol.lu.se; per.nystrom@limnol.lu.se; pia.romare@limnol.lu.se; lars.tranvik@limno.uu.se,"Pettersson, Lars/AAX-3948-2020; Tranvik, Lars J/H-2222-2011; Lundberg, Per/A-2479-2010; Nilsson, Anders/H-6836-2014","Pettersson, Lars/0000-0001-5745-508X; Nilsson, Anders/0000-0002-3541-9835; Persson, Anders/0000-0001-5961-3651; Tranvik, Lars J./0000-0003-3509-8266; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; Lundberg, Per/0000-0002-9609-726X",,,,76,68,72,1,55,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

This study explores the population regulation of E. mathaei under conditions of reduced predator abundance. Experimental density manipulations suggest some density-dependent mortality, yet populations on heavily fished reefs continue to increase despite high biomass and reduced food. On two of three studied reefs, including the site with the highest population density, adult and juvenile densities were positively correlated in 1-m2 quadrats. Individuals on the high population-density reef had smaller gonads and gonad indices (gonad wt . body wt-1), lower relative gut weights, a higher fraction of calcium carbonate in their guts, larger Aristotle's lantern indices (jaw wt . body wt-1), and lower respiration rates than individuals on the low population density reef. Comparisons with individuals starved in aquaria indicate that these are responses to reduced food availability. There was no indication that larger individuals were able to avoid resource limitations more effectively than small individuals. Additionally, there was no indication of reduced body size with increasing population density. The frequency of intraspecific agonistic behavior during experimental manipulations was lower (G test, p < 0.001) on the high than on the low-density reef. Agonistic behavior appears important for defending burrows which reduces predator-induced mortality but not in maintaining a balance between the population food requirements and food resources. In high-density reefs, where predator densities and topographic complexity are low, the lack of predators and agonistic behavior or territorial defense leads to unrestrained population increases and reduced energy availability to individuals. Regulation occurs at the level of the individual organism, allowing high population densities through decreased energy availability to all individuals.","UNIV FLORIDA, CTR WETLANDS, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA; BROWN UNIV, DEPT BIOL & MED, PROVIDENCE, RI 02912 USA",,,"McClanahan, Tim/K-4998-2019","McClanahan, Timothy/0000-0001-5821-3584",,,,71,77,80,0,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,1879-1697,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Less well studied, however, is how the CE and NCE of multiple predator species can interact to influence the combined effect of multiple predators on prey mortality. We examined the extent to which the NCE of one predator altered the CE of another predator on a shared prey and evaluated whether we can better predict the combined impact of multiple predators on prey when accounting for this influence. We conducted a set of experiments with larval dragonflies, adult newts (a known keystone predator), and their tadpole prey. We quantified the CE and NCE of each predator, the extent to which NCEs from one predator alters the CE of the second predator, and the combined effect of both predators on prey mortality. We then compared the combined effect of both predators on prey mortality to four predictive models. Dragonflies caused more tadpoles to hide under leaf litter (a NCE), where newts spend less time foraging, which reduced the foraging success (CE) of newts. Newts altered tadpole behavior but not in a way that altered the foraging success of dragonflies. Our study suggests that we can better predict the combined effect of multiple predators on prey when we incorporate the influence of interactions between the CE and NCE of multiple predators into a predictive model. In our case, the threat of predation to prey by one predator reduced the foraging efficiency of a keystone predator. Consequently, the ability of a predator to fill a keystone role could be compromised by the presence of other predators.","[Davenport, Jon M.] E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Davenport, Jon M.] E Carolina Univ, Ctr Biodivers, Greenville, NC 27858 USA","Davenport, JM (corresponding author), E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",jon.davenport@mso.umt.edu,"Davenport, Jon M/AAG-8457-2020","Davenport, Jon M/0000-0002-9911-2779; Chalcraft, David/0000-0002-2165-0948","National Science Foundation grantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0716558, DEB-1050459]",This work was supported by a National Science Foundation grant (DEB-0716558) to D.

Consequently, climate warming is expected to favour smaller taxa from lower trophic levels and smaller individuals within populations. To test these hypotheses, we surveyed zooplankton communities in 20 boreal lakes in Killarney Provincial Park, Canada during 2005 (an anomalously warm summer) and 2006 (a normal summer). Higher trophic levels had larger responses to warm temperatures supporting the stress-size hypothesis; however, rather than imposing negative effects, higher density and biomass were observed under warmer temperatures. As a result, larger taxa from higher trophic levels were disproportionately favoured with warming, precluding an expected shift towards smaller species. Proportionately greater increases in metabolic rates of larger organisms or altered biotic interactions (e. g. predation and competition) are possible explanations for shifts in biomass distribution. Warmer temperatures also favoured smaller individuals of the two most common species, in agreement with the stress-size hypothesis. Despite this, these populations had higher biomass in the warm summer. Therefore, reduced adult survivorship may have triggered these species to invest in reproduction over growth. Hence, warmer epilimnions, higher zooplankton biomass and smaller individuals within zooplankton populations may function as sensitive indicators of climate warming in boreal lakes.","[MacLennan, Megan M.; Arnott, Shelley E.; Strecker, Angela L.] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","MacLennan, MM (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada.",mmmaclen@ualberta.ca,"Strecker, Angela/E-9430-2016; MacLennan, Megan M./L-4293-2019","Strecker, Angela/0000-0001-9387-1654; Arnott, Shelley/0000-0002-3834-703X; MacLennan, Megan/0000-0001-6518-0290",Ontario Ministry of the Environment; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Friends of Killarney Park,"The authors thank J.

We assessed the relative impacts of insect and mammalian herbivores and compared the relative importance of herbivory in coastal and inland habitats and among locations with different microclimates across a coastal dune. Effects of insect and mammalian herbivores were tested with a combination of insecticidal spray and cage exclusion treatments in a factorial experiment at the coastal site. Mammalian herbivores strongly affected the population dynamics of C. occidentale in both years, and their effects were augmented by fungal infection (1991), herbivory by stem-borers (1990) and, to a lesser extent, by insect seed predators in both years. Mammals caused most plant deaths, but the mammal species responsible differed among sites. Rabbit herbivory altered the vegetative growth of coastal thistles and significantly modified other key aspects of Cirsium demography, including growth rate and timing of reproduction. Small, uncaged plants grazed by rabbits took at least 1 year longer to mature than did caged plants. Larvae of Pyrausta subsequalis were the only insects that killed established plants. In 1990 and 1991, the numbers of insects damaging seed heads before dispersal were low, but were sufficient to cause receptacle and seed damage. The number of mature, undamaged seeds (and percent successful seed production) was reduced significantly only for heads infested by fungi near the ocean in 1991: the fungus occurred in 37% of heads and caused a 77% reduction in mature seeds.","UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ,DEPT BIOL,SANTA CRUZ,CA 95064",,,,,,,,38,37,38,1,33,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,1997,111,3,,,,,413,421,,10.1007/s004420050253,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XP311,WOS:A1997XP31100016,28308137,,,,2021-09-27,

Many of these prairie potholes are fishless and this apparent void is filled, at least partially, by tiger salamanders. Based on gut contents from 98 tiger salamanders and published diet data from over 1500 ducks, we show that there is general overlap in diet between both larval and adult tiger salamanders and 10 duck species. Furthermore, when the ducks were split into foraging guilds and compared with tiger salamanders, prey type overlap was 1.7 times higher and prey size was 1.8 times higher with dabbling ducks than diving ducks. Field surveys show that tiger salamander density is more highly correlated with diving duck density across potholes than dabbling duck density. Tiger salamanders have higher diet overlap with dabbling ducks than diving ducks whereas tiger salamanders have higher spatial overlap with diving ducks than dabbling ducks suggesting that these consumers coarsely partition diet and habitat resources. It has been reported that tiger salamanders have specialized diets that are associated with foraging preferences for benthic habitats. This view is too narrow: in southwestern Manitoba, Canada, tiger salamanders are more general consumers with diets more like dabbling ducks that forage mostly in planktonic and littoral habitats. Our results suggest that dabbling and diving ducks are, to different extents, liable to the effects of indirect interactions, specifically competition for common prey, with tiger salamanders.","Univ Guelph, Dept Zool, Guelph, ON N1G ZW1, Canada","Benoy, GA (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Zool, Guelph, ON N1G ZW1, Canada.",gbenoy@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,82,14,15,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,AUG,2002,481,1-3,,,,,47,59,,10.1023/A:1021260920095,,,13,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,617XZ,WOS:000179387400004,,,,,2021-09-27,

Costs and benefits of reproduction are central to life-history theory, and the outcome of reproductive trade-offs may depend greatly on the ecological conditions in which they are estimated. In this study, we propose that costs and benefits of reproduction are modulated by social effects, and consequently that selection on reproductive rates depends on the social environment. 2. We tested this hypothesis in a great tit Parus major population. Over 3 years, we altered parental reproductive effort via brood size manipulations (small, intermediate, large) and manipulated the local social environment via changes in the local fledgling density (decreased, increased) and the local sex ratio (female-biased, control, male-biased). 3. We found that male-biased treatment consistently increased the subsequent local breeding densities over the 3-year study period. We also found that parents rearing small broods in these male-biased plots had increased survival rates compared with the other experimental groups. 4. We conclude that reproductive costs are the product of an interaction between parental phenotypic quality after reproduction and the social environment: raising a small brood had long-lasting effects on some phenotypic traits of the parents and that this increased their survival chances in male-biased environment where habitat quality may have deteriorated (via increased disease/predation risk or intraspecific competition). 5. Our results provide the first experimental evidence that local sex ratio can affect reproductive costs and thus optimal clutch size.","[Nicolaus, Marion; Michler, Stephanie P.

Habituation has invaluable strengths, particularly in quantity and diversity of data collected, but along with these come substantial weaknesses, i.e., costs both in time and effort, health risks, and potential exposure of subjects to poaching. With new technologies, we are able to extend our studies beyond the limitations of habituation; camera traps are one technology that can be used to study unhabituated primate groups. In this study we used eight camera traps over the course of 2 yr (1542 camera trap days) to capture thousands of still images of West African savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in the Fal,m, region of southeastern Senegal. Images corroborated behavioral observations from habituated chimpanzees at the Fongoli site, where researchers have observed nocturnal activity and cave use. The cameras also captured interspecies interactions at water sources during the dry season and allowed us to determine demographic composition and minimum community size. The photographs provide data on local fauna, including predators (Panthera pardus pardus, Panthera leo senegalesis, and Crocuta crocuta), potential prey, and competitor species (Papio papio, Cercopithecus aethiops, and Erythrocebus patas). As primate habitat across Africa is further threatened and human-wildlife conflict increases, camera trapping could be used as an essential conservation tool, expanding studies of primates without exacerbating potential threats to the species.","[Boyer-Ontl, Kelly M.; Pruetz, Jill D.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Grad Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Boyer-Ontl, KM (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Ecol & Evolutionary Biol Grad Program, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",kmboyer@iastate.edu,"Ontl, Kelly Boyer/P-5052-2019","Ontl, Kelly Boyer/0000-0001-7441-0289; Pruetz, Jill/0000-0002-9151-8571",Houston Zoo Inc.'s Naturally Wild Conservation Department; United States Fish and Wildlife Service Great Ape Conservation Fund; Margot Marsh Biodiversity Fund; Blank Park Zoo; Department of Anthropology at Iowa State University,"We thank the Republic of Senegal and Department of Eaux et Forets for permission to work in Senegal.

To study the population dynamics of the insect in its native range, we investigated the influence of host log age (fresh or aged), protection from ant predation, and protection from parasitism by specialist larval parasitoids on numbers of initial larval feeding galleries, larval mortality, larval survivorship, and parasitization. There were greater numbers of initial larval galleries when ants were excluded, and greater numbers on fresh logs than on aged logs. However, mortality of larvae was greater in fresh logs, as well as when larvae were exposed to parasitism. Survivorship was greater when ants and parasitoids were excluded. Larvae achieved a larger size in fresh logs and in logs protected from parasitism. Fresh host material may provide a fitness advantage because it is a higher quality resource, but greater infestation of that material also increases the probability of mortality from competition among larvae. The results suggest that there are potential ecological interactions among food quality, host resistance, natural enemies, and competition that must be considered in evaluating the population dynamics of this species in native and novel environments.","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Paine, TD (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",,,,,,,39,19,19,0,16,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

No difference in dominance was found when tesselated blennies had a 10% advantage in size. However, tesselated blennies were able to successfully defend cavities against equal-sized competitors when given the advantage of prior residence. This prior residence advantage persisted despite seaweed blennies having the advantage of past experience. Seaweed blennies attain a larger size on petroleum platforms, but empty barnacle cavities are common in this environment. Tesselated blennies are able to colonize and successfully spawn because they can enter an empty barnacle cavity, gain the advantage of prior residence, and successfully defend this cavity.","Univ So Mississippi, Dept Biol Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA","Rauch, TJ (corresponding author), William Carey Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 498 Tuscan Ave,WCC 203, Hattiesburg, MS 39401 USA.",trauch@wmcarey.edu,,,,,,26,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

In spite of the recognition of the competition between fisheries and marine predators for the same resources, few comprehensive assessments of the level of overlap between marine predators and fisheries have been conducted. Data from 273 daily boat surveys over a period of 4 years along the northwestern coast of Spain were used to assess the environmental, topographic, and anthropogenic correlates of habitat use and relative density of short-beaked common dolphins. Moreover, the degree of vulnerability of this marine top predator to coastal fisheries was assessed by identifying the type of fisheries associated with the presence of common dolphins. Our results reported that common dolphin presents a fine-scale pattern of habitat use, with an unequal use of available habitat and varying relative abundance, which was mostly related to the variation in environmental, topographic, and anthropogenic variables. The high occurrence of common dolphins in zones characterized by a high bottom trawl fishing pressure was indirectly linked to the susceptibility of these marine predators to fishing activities. These findings can be used as a relevant indicator of the degree of vulnerability of common dolphins to human pressure providing comprehensive information on which to base conservation and management strategies.","[Diaz Lopez, Bruno; Methion, Severine; Giralt Paradell, Oriol] BDRI, Av Beiramar 192, O Grove 36980, Spain; [Methion, Severine] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR 5805, EPOC, Allee Geoffroy St Hilaire, F-33615 Pessac, France; [Giralt Paradell, Oriol] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Lee Rd, Cork, Ireland","Lopez, BD (corresponding author), BDRI, Av Beiramar 192, O Grove 36980, Spain.",bruno@thebdri.com,"Paradell, Oriol Giralt/V-5387-2017; Lopez, Bruno Diaz/H-5745-2019; Methion, Severine/S-1608-2019","Paradell, Oriol Giralt/0000-0002-7734-7235; Lopez, Bruno Diaz/0000-0002-0388-3289; Methion, Severine/0000-0002-9348-2592",Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute (BDRI),"Field observations carried out during this work are part of a long-term study supported by funding from the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute (BDRI).

However, in some species, ornamented females can be found in high numbers, suggesting that they may experience benefits that offset these costs. Some female fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) possess blue badges that are similar to, but less dramatic than, those displayed by males during courtship and dominance contests. Females bearing these badges have reduced reproductive investment and are less desirable as mates, costs that are difficult to reconcile with the high prevalence of this trait (up to 95% of females) in some populations. To test the hypothesis that there are potential benefits associated with male-typical ornamentation in females, we compared fitness-relevant performance, behavior and morphology of ornamented and unornamented female fence lizards and their offspring. Ornamented females achieved faster sprinting speeds and had offspring that were more likely to flee from predatory attacks and had longer bodies; these traits are associated with higher survival in this species. These results suggest the presence of two female morphotypes that may be differentially favored under contrasting environmental conditions. Unornamented females appear to have a reproductive advantage that should be favored under low predation environments. By contrast, ornamented females have traits that would confer a fitness advantage in high-predation environments. This work suggests a potential mechanism maintaining male-typical female ornamentation in nature.","[Assis, B.

During rodent scarcity, predators such as Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) consume alternative prey, such as migratory birds, which are plentiful during summer. In most of the Arctic these birds return south by August, but in northern Manitoba, near the southern edge of the Arctic fox distribution, large numbers of lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) and Canada geese (Branta canadensis interior) persist into October. This extended availability of geese late into fall may reduce the dependence of Arctic foxes on rodents. We used stable isotope and faecal analyses to reconstruct the Arctic fox fall and winter diet and related the most probable contributions of lemmings, goose eggs and juvenile geese with changes in prey availability and fox reproduction. Geese were a potentially important component of the fall diet for Arctic foxes, especially in years with high goose productivity, but rodents were the main component of the diet in late winter, even though rodents were scarce each summer (2010-2013). Furthermore, rodent density had a greater influence on Arctic fox reproduction, which was correlated with the subsequent winter harvest, than any other variable examined.

The foods are characterized by different nutritional or energetic values per unit volume, and the forager has constraints on both the amount of time it has available for foraging and on the volume of food that can be processed per unit time. Such a situation characterizes the diet choice problem faced by many herbivores. The two food types may occur in the same habitat, or they may occur in different habitat patches; in the latter case, they cannot be encountered simultaneously. Unlike earlier analyses of these diet problems, here we consider the risk of mortality when foraging and allow risk to differ between habitats. Optimal time allocation strategies and the resultant functional responses are calculated for both one- and two-habitat situations. Mortality risk can substantially change the forager's time allocations and, consequently, its functional responses. Increasing mortality risk in both habitats proportionally can increase use of the habitat that has the greater risk. Time allocation often responds in a non-monotonic fashion to changes in the density of a particular food. As a result, functional responses may decrease with increasing food abundance over one or more ranges of abundance. Experimental findings on the response of grasshopper foraging to the risk of spider predation are compared with the theory. Finally, the possible indirect interactions between the food species in this simple food web are discussed.","Univ Maryland, Dept Zool, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Abrams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Zool, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",abrams@zool.umd.edu,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X",,,,27,22,23,1,32,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,1937-3791,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

We predicted a longitudinal change of ecosystem properties along the river, and also that potamal areas of the river are similar to lakes. In rivers with periodic floods we also expect a high degree of similarity due to increased environmental similarity and increase dispersal of component species. Otherwise, rivers must be conceived as a landscape element with an intrinsic hierarchical nature and dispersal among its parts are constrained by this structure. Under this view, we also could expect that different basin or different micro-basin could present communities that are historically different in their general properties. Here, we aimed to describe odonate larval communities in the Pantanal Mortes-Araguaia river basin in Brazil comparing the composition, species richness and community structure between lakes and rivers, and also the possible differences among river basins. The field work was done in three rivers and three lakes chosen to conform to a paired experiment, each pair in a different river basin. An aggregated sampling unit was used based on Ekman dredge and D-nets replicated on each site. We sampled 936 individuals distributed in 30 genera and a total of 34 morphotypes. There was no difference in species richness among lakes and rivers, but a marked difference among basins. Samples from the same basin present a higher similarity of the species abundance relations than among river or lake samples. We also did not observed differences in composition and community structure between large rivers and lakes, in the same basin. The results supported the concept of structural similarity between large rivers and lakes and the differences observed among basins could indicate historical events in colonization that are shaping communities characteristics.","Univ Fed Goias, Dept Biol Geral, Lab Ecol Teor & Sintese, BR-74001970 Goiania, Go, Brazil; Univ Fed Vicosa, Programa Pos Grad Entomol, BR-36571000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil; Univ Estado Mato Grosso, Dept Ciencias Biol, BR-78690000 Nova Xavantina, Mato Grosso, Brazil","De Marco, P (corresponding author), Univ Fed Goias, Dept Biol Geral, Lab Ecol Teor & Sintese, BR-74001970 Goiania, Go, Brazil.",leandrojuen@insecta.ufv.br; hcabette@uol.com.br; pdemarco@icb.ufg.br,"De Marco, Paulo/B-2209-2009; Juen, Leandro/I-1338-2012; Juen, Leandro/R-4014-2019","De Marco, Paulo/0000-0002-3628-6405; Juen, Leandro/0000-0002-6188-4386",,,,56,46,51,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,MAR,2007,579,,,,,,125,134,,10.1007/s10750-006-0395-6,,,10,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,135XM,WOS:000244187200010,,Green Published,,,2021-09-27,

Canopy-forming trees in tropical forests strongly influence later stages of succession through their effect on woody plant regeneration. In dry forests, this may be complex given the seasonal interplay of water and light limitations. We reviewed observational and experimental studies to assess (1) the relative importance of positive and negative effects of established trees on regeneration; (2) the mechanisms underlying these effects; and (3) to test the 'stress gradient hypothesis' in successional tropical dry forests. The effects of established trees on seed dispersal, seed survival, and seed germination-either through direct changes to moisture and temperature regimes or mediated by seed dispersers and predators-are mainly positive. The balance between positive and negative effects on seedling establishment is more complex and depends on the season and leaf phenology of both trees and seedlings. Seedling survival is generally enhanced by established trees mitigating dry conditions. Established trees have counteracting effects on water and light availability that influence seedling growth. The probability of a positive effect of established trees on seedling survival decreases with increased rainfall, which supports the stress gradient hypothesis. Priorities for future research are experiments to test for facilitation and competition and their underlying mechanisms, long-term studies evaluating how these effects change with ontogeny, and studies focusing on the species-specificity of interactions.","[Derroire, Geraldine; Healey, John R.] Bangor Univ, Sch Environm Nat Resources & Geog, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales; [Derroire, Geraldine; Tigabu, Mulualem; Oden, Per Christer] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, POB 49, SE-23053 Alnarp, Sweden","Derroire, G (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Environm Nat Resources & Geog, Bangor LL57 2UW, Gwynedd, Wales.",g.derroire@bangor.ac.uk,"Healey, John R/J-3719-2016; Derroire, Geraldine/I-8959-2012","Healey, John R/0000-0002-5398-2293; Derroire, Geraldine/0000-0001-7239-2881; Tigabu, Mulualem/0000-0003-2471-1168",European Commission under the FONASO Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate Programme,"This study has been supported by the European Commission under the FONASO Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate Programme.

Although competition for resources generally increases size variability, the effect of (non-consumptive) predation on this demographic trait remains relatively poorly understood. Existing models suggest a positive correlation between growth rate (mediated by resource level) and expression of size variability (as measured by the coefficient of variation) in prey cohorts. We tested this prediction by exposing the tadpoles of the Japanese Forest Green Treefrog (Rhacophorus arboreus (Okada and Kawano, 1924) = Zhangixalus arboreus (Okada and Kawano, 1924)) to the non-lethal presence of gape-limited Japanese Fire-bellied Newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster (Boie, 1826)) at low and high predator densities in an outdoor mesocosm experiment. Tadpole growth rates and periphyton biomass increased with newt density. But in contrast to prediction, elevated growth rates did not increase but, reversely, decreased cohort size variability in the tadpoles. We discuss two potential mechanisms behind this outcome. First, increased resource availability mediated by predator feeding may have reduced the strength of competition, ultimately leading to more evenly distributed resource gains among individuals; second, if smaller individuals grew relatively faster than larger individuals, as to quicken entry to a size refuge against the gape-limited predator, then inter-individual size differences could diminish over time.","[Ramamonjisoa, Noelikanto; Mori, Akira] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Ramamonjisoa, N (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",noelikanto@ethol.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [18F1871]","The experiment was conducted under the Kyoto University Animal Ethics Approval H3019.

In amphibians, tadpoles activate plastic responses to reduce predation risk by reducing their activity rate and altering their morphology, specifically tail depth and pigmentation. Furthermore, there is now evidence that tadpoles' defenses are modified when predators combine with other stressful factors such as pollutants or competitors, but our knowledge on the physiological responses underlying these responses is still scarce. Here we study physiological responses in Pelobates cultripes tadpoles exposed to a natural predator (larvae of the aquatic beetle Dytiscus circumflexus), non-lethal concentrations of herbicide (glyphosate, 0.5 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L) or both factors combined. We measured corticosterone levels, standard metabolic rate, oxidative damage (TBARS) and activity of antioxidant enzymes, and immune response (via leukocyte count). Tadpoles reduced their corticosterone concentration by ca. 24% in the presence of predator cues, whereas corticosterone did not change in the presence of glyphosate. Two enzymes involved in antioxidant response also decreased in the presence of predators (14.7% and 13.2% respectively) but not to glyphosate. Herbicide, however, increased the number of neutrophils and reduced that of lymphocytes, and had an interaction effect with predator presence. Standard metabolic rate did not vary across treatments in our experiment. Thus we show a marked physiological response to the presence of predators but little evidence for interaction between predators and low levels of herbicide. Multiple assessment of the physiological state of animals is important to understand the basis and consequences of phenotypic plasticity.","[Burraco, Pablo; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan] CSIC, EBD, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, E-41092 Seville, Spain","Gomez-Mestre, I (corresponding author), CSIC, EBD, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, E-41092 Seville, Spain.",igmestre@ebd.csic.es,"Gomez-Mestre, Ivan/F-8226-2014","Gomez-Mestre, Ivan/0000-0003-0094-8195", [CGL2009-11123],"We thank R.

The behaviour of topmouth gudgeon has already been studied from a number of aspects, however, complex investigations on the habitat use of the species in invaded regions were not carried out yet. Here the habitat use of the fish in a close-to-nature pond system was examined with special, non-selective minnow traps and observations were subsequently complemented by aquarium experiments. Our findings revealed that in a pond inhabited by predator fish, topmouth gudgeon preferred the pelagial region, while in a pond free of predator fish, they preferred the littoral zone. The examined abiotic parameters had no effect on the habitat use of the fish. In a simplified artificial environment experiments have yielded the same results. The findings showed that topmouth gudgeon is rather flexible in adapting to the environmental conditions, the available nutrition base, but from the aspect of habitat use the most significant factor is probably the presence of predatory fish.

Twenty years after Daphnia lumholtzi invaded Lake Texoma, OK-TX we uncovered seasonality in D. lumholtzi abundances and defensive morphology. Tail-spine growth was hyperallometric (faster than core body growth) in summer and fall, but allometric (growing at same rate as body) in winter. Head-spine growth declined with increasing body size, and was curvilinear in summer and fall, but linear in winter. Thus, we hypothesized that the selective predation pressure acting upon these traits is strongest in summer and fall and that the large plastic defensive spines allow persistence of D. lumholtzi. Additionally, we found that abundances of D. lumholtzi in Lake Texoma were best predicted by cyanobacteria concentration. However, as lab experiments have shown that D. lumholtzi does not have superior cyanobacteria tolerance, cyanobacteria may be serving as a proxy for another pressure shaping the abundance of D. lumholtzi, like a seasonal predator. The niche of this invasive species within Lake Texoma appears to be primarily limited by predation pressure, and further studies may illuminate whether this limiting factor is responsible for range limits within North America.","[Beyer, Jessica E.] Univ Oklahoma, Program Ecol & Evolut Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; Univ Oklahoma, Plankton Ecol & Limnol Lab, Dept Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA","Beyer, JE (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Program Ecol & Evolut Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",beyer@ou.edu,"Hambright, Karl D/D-4086-2012","Beyer, Jessica/0000-0002-3388-3255",Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation (Sport Fish Restoration Program) [F-61-R]; University of Okla homa Biological Station (Graduate Research Fellowship); University of Oklahoma Department of Biology (Adams Fellowship),"Funding was provided by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation (through the Sport Fish Restoration Program, Grant F-61-R to K.D.H), the University of Okla homa Biological Station (through a Graduate Research Fellowship to J.E.B) and the University of Oklahoma Department of Biology (through an Adams Fellowship to J.E.B).",,60,0,0,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-7873,1464-3774,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

There was less variation in catch community composition among the fishing grounds than the closures, suggesting that fishing has homogenised catch composition. The trap survey found that some parrotfish [Leptoscarus vaigiensis (Quoy &Gaimard), Calotomus carolinus (Valenciennes) and Scarus ghobban Forsskal] were relatively more common and that some important predators of macro-invertebrates [Balistapus undulatus (Mungo Park) and Cheilinus chlorourus (Bloch)] were less common in the fishing grounds than closures. Unexpectedly, and in contrast to visual census results, cumulative number of species in catch surveys was higher in open access than closures sites. This may result from fishers covering more area and habitat or a reduction in the catch of competitively subordinate and rare species by aggressive, early-caught fish that can dominate bait. Comparisons of ecological visual census surveys and fisheries-dependent methods indicated that small differences in catch composition can reflect larger ecological differences and that baiting methods can underestimate biodiversity. Ecological impacts of fishing and large-scale changes in marine ecosystems must be considerable given the many fisheries-dependent assessments report modest changes.","[Omukoto, J.

In this work the distributional abundance data of fish was studied in two interconnected Andean Patagonian lakes with varying proportions of contrasting habitat types. Hydroacoustic data (120 kHz) were used to analyze fish abundance and habitat use during the mixis and stratification periods. Three types of habitat (near shore, surface pelagic and deep pelagic) and two groups of fish, based on size (Big Fish >12 cm total length and Fish Larvae and Small Fish <12 cm total length) were defined. The distribution of both fish groups in these lakes revealed differences in habitat use for each lake and period. Fish group abundance was related to the availability of habitat types, according to the morphology of each lake. The Big Fish group showed preference for the near shore habitat during lake stratification and always appeared as individual targets. The Fish Larvae and Small Fish group used mainly the pelagic habitat during mixis, where they formed dense sound scattering layers. However, during lake stratification many individual targets from this group were found both in pelagic and near shore habitats, which would seem to indicate a change in distributional behavior. This is possibly associated with niche changes in the Galaxiids (Galaxias spp), a key component of Northern Patagonian lake food webs. Lakes like Moreno Oeste, which are morphologically and structurally more complex, could have more diverse fish ensembles with higher abundances. In contrast, lakes of simple morphology with low development of near shore habitats and ample deep zones, like Lake Moreno Este, could present lower Big Fish abundance. The contrasting habitat availability between lakes accounts for the abundances and distribution patterns of each fish group. While in these lakes fish assemblage species composition could depends on the environmental filter, the particular structure of a fish assemblage in terms of the proportional abundances of species depends on proportional habitat type availability. We can speculate that in Andean Patagonian lakes Galaxiids mediate a habitat coupling process critical for the transfer of energy and matter in oligotrophic lakes. We may also consider that the Small Puyen in this type of lake is a keystone prey species that relieves predation pressure on other potential prey. The existence of deep pelagic habitats in numerous deep lakes in the Northern Patagonian Andean region provides not only daytime refuge for Galaxiids, which allows them to maintain their high numbers in the lakes, but could also, in the long term, act as a Galaxiid source for other water bodies.

For wetland-dependent amphibians, forested buffers may mitigate timber-harvest impacts, but little empirical research has focused on buffers around lentic habitats. We conducted a landscape experiment to examine how spotted salamander and wood frog reproductive output (i.e., eggmass and metamorph production) respond to clearcutting mediated by buffers of different widths (i.e., uncut, 30 m buffer, 100 m buffer) at ephemeral pools in an industrial forest. We found complex interactions between buffer treatment and reproductive output, which were strongly mediated by hydroperiod. Overall, reproductive output was most sensitive at 30 m-buffer pools and for salamanders, but responses diverged across productivity metrics even within these categories. Notably, for both cut treatments over time, while salamander eggmass abundance decreased, metamorph productivity (i.e., snout-vent length [SVL] and abundance) tended to increase. For example, average metamorph SVLs were predicted to lengthen between 0.2 and 0.4 mm per year post-cut. Additionally, typical relationships between reproductive output and hydroperiod (as indicated by the reference treatment) were disrupted for both species in both cut treatments. For example, long-hydroperiod pools produced more salamander metamorphs than short-hydroperiod pools in both the reference and 30 m-buffer treatments, but the rate of increase was lower in the 30 m-buffer treatment such that a long-hydroperiod pool in the reference treatment was predicted to produce, on average, 24 more metamorphs than a similar pool in the 30 m-buffer treatment. From a conservation perspective, our results highlight the importance of evaluating both terrestrial and aquatic responses to terrestrial habitat disturbance, since responses may be reinforcing (i.e., exert similarly positive or negative effects, with the potential for amplification in the aquatic habitat) or decoupled (i.e., operate independently or be negatively correlated, with responses in the aquatic habitat potentially dampening or counteracting responses in the terrestrial habitat).","[Powell, Jessica S.

In spite of the biological richness of the invaded area, no study ever addressed the evolution of the invasion process. We aimed to investigate the current distribution and status of the mink in NW Portugal and discuss some contributing factors to explain the rate of invasion. We detected mink presence using floating rafts as footprint tracking devices, and scats as a molecular tool aiding in species identification. Results demonstrate a clear range expansion southwards, with mink already occupying most of the region's hydrographic basins. After a first phase of slow expansion (55 km in 20 years), mink seems to have expanded its range quite rapidly in only 2 years (45 km). The initial delay could be due to local thriving otter populations, whereas the recent establishment of red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in the area could be a plausible explanation for the acceleration in the mink's expansion. Being a key food resource, crayfish may be playing an important role as an expansion facilitator. Mink eradication is probably no longer feasible since well established populations near the border continue to function as sources for the Portuguese population. Therefore, a control program should start immediately in the NW region, preferably in conjunction with Spanish authorities.","[Rodrigues, Diana C.; Simoes, Luciana; Mullins, Jacinta; Mendes, Raquel C.; Fernandes, Carlos; Rebelo, Rui; Santos-Reis, Margarida] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Biol Ambiental, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Lampa, Simone] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Conservat Biol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany","Rodrigues, DC (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Biol Ambiental, Ed C2-5 Piso,Campo Grande, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",rodriguesdia@gmail.com,"Rebelo, Rui/D-7054-2013; Fernandes, Carlos/J-3045-2013; Santos-Reis, Margarida/H-4064-2011; Fernandes, Carlos/AAB-5256-2019","Rebelo, Rui/0000-0003-2544-1470; Fernandes, Carlos/0000-0002-1386-8103; Fernandes, Carlos/0000-0002-1386-8103; Santos-Reis, Margarida/0000-0002-0337-963X",Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia''Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [PTDC/BIA-BEC/102433/2008]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) [D/07/49405]; Helmholtz Interdisciplinary Graduate School for Environmental Research (HIGRADE),"We would like to thank the Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia'' for funding Project DILEMA-Alien species and conservation dilemmas: the effects of native competitors and alien prey species on the spread of the American mink in Portugal'' (PTDC/BIA-BEC/102433/2008).

In this article we present an extensive analysis of a model that describes the competition between cyanobacteria of the Oscillatoria group and green algae exploited by Daphnia. In particular, we study the response of the model to changes in the nutrient concentration and predation by zooplanktivorous fish. The analysis is repeated for an array of different assumptions on the nutritional value of cyanobacteria and selectivity of zooplankton grazing. When fish predation pressure is so high that Daphnia density is negligible, there is competitive exclusion between the two primary producers, and over a range of nutrient levels, there are two alternative attractors: one with only cyanobacteria and one with only green algae. When fish predation pressure is lower, zooplankton becomes important, and if grazing by these animals is sufficiently selective, this may cause a third attractor on which Daphnia, cyanobacteria, and algae coexist. This mixed attractor may be stationary, oscillatory, or chaotic. Depending on the nutrient level, the nutritional value of cyanobacteria, and the selectivity of zooplankton, cyanobacterial dominance may be either induced or eliminated in response to reduced fish predation. This is well in line with the confusing array of field studies and experimental results.","Agr Univ Wageningen, Dept Water Qual Management & Aquat Ecol, NL-6700 DD Wageningen, Netherlands; Politecn Milan, Dept Elect & Informat, I-20133 Milan, Italy; Politecn Milan, Res Ctr Comp Sci Environm, I-20133 Milan, Italy","Scheffer, M (corresponding author), Agr Univ Wageningen, Dept Water Qual Management & Aquat Ecol, POB 8080, NL-6700 DD Wageningen, Netherlands.",gragnani@elet.polimi.it; marten@cc.ruu.nl; rinaldi@elet.polimi.it,"Scheffer, Marten/C-1852-2012",,,,,63,61,64,0,24,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

We examined the impact of poisoning of foxes on the relative abundance of a group of medium-sized mammals in an experiment conducted in three large forest blocks in south-eastern Australia. The blocks consisted of paired sites, as follows: one site where poison baiting was used to control foxes (treatment site) and one where foxes were not controlled (non-treatment site). At all six sites, the population responses of a range of mammals were measured, and compared between treatment and non-treatment sites. The relative fox abundance, as indexed by bait-take, declined during the course of the study at treatment sites and to a lesser extent at non-treatment sites. The decline in bait-take at non-treatment sites was most likely due to treatment sites acting as ecological traps, so that reduced intra-specific competition attracted foxes from non-treatment to treatment sites, where they were subsequently poisoned. There was a significant treatment effect for the abundances of total mammals, long-nosed potoroos, southern brown bandicoots and common brushtail possums, with higher abundances at treatment sites than at non-treatment sites. Common ringtail possums increased in abundance during the course of the study, with no significant difference between treatment and non-treatment sites. There was no significant effect of time or treatment on the abundance of long-nosed bandicoots. The increase in the abundance of native mammals at treatment sites was most likely due to a lower predation pressure by foxes brought about by fox control, and the smaller increase in abundance in non-treatment blocks was likely due to the ecological-trap effect because of fox baiting at treatment sites. The present study demonstrated that broad-scale fox control can lead to increases in the abundance of native mammals in forested habitats, without recourse to aerial baiting or fences. The study also demonstrated that the influence of fox control on the fox abundance can extend well beyond the perimeter of the area baited.","[Dexter, Nick] Booderee Natl Pk, Jervis Bay, JBT 2540, Australia; [Murray, Andy] Dept Sustainabil & Environm, Orbost, Vic 3888, Australia","Dexter, N (corresponding author), Booderee Natl Pk, Village Rd, Jervis Bay, JBT 2540, Australia.",nick.dexter@environment.gov.au,,,Federal Australian Department of Environment and Heritage; Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment,"This study was funded initially by the Federal Australian Department of Environment and Heritage, and subsequently by the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment.

The model includes four major variables, that is, population densities of three kinds of butterflies (two female forms f. cyrus, f. polytes and the unpalatable butterfly Pachliopta aristolochiae) and their predator. It is well-known that the non-mimic f. cyrus resembles and attracts the male most, and the mimic f. polytes mimics the model butterfly P. aristolochiae. Based on experimental evidence, we assume that two forms f. cyrus and f. polytes interact under intraspecific competition for resources including the male, and the growth rate of f. cyrus is higher than that of f. polytes. We further assume that both the benefit of mimicry for the mimic f. polytes and the cost for the model are dependent on their relative frequencies, i.e. the motality of the mimic by predation decreases with increase in frequency of the model, while the motality of the model increases as the frequency of the mimic increases. Taking the density-dependent effect through carrying capacity into account, we set up a model system consisting of three ordinary differential equations (ODEs), analyze it mathematically and provide computer simulations that confirm the analytical results. Our results reproduce field records on population dynamics of P. polytes in the Miyako-jima Island.

The hypothesis of exploitation ecosystems (EEH) belongs to the latter category and focuses particularly on the consequences of the high energetic costs of maintenance of endotherms. Carnivorous endotherms require relatively high prey densities in order to break even. Moreover, they are dependent on folivorous prey during the limiting season, at least at high latitudes. The endotherm branch of the grazing web is thus predicted to collapse From three-link trophic dynamics (carnivores --> folivores --> plants --> inorganic resources) to two-link dynamics (folivores --> plants --> inorganic resources) along gradients of decreasing primary productivity. Consequently, the vegetation of cold and unproductive areas is predicted to be under intense winter grazing pressure, which prevents the accumulation of aboveground plant biomass and excludes erect woody plants. In the most extreme habitats (e.g., polar deserts and their high alpine counterparts), even folivorous endotherms are predicted to be absent, and the scanty vegetation is predicted to be structured by preemptive competition. Within temperature-determined productivity gradients, EEH is corroborated by biomass patterns, by patterns in the structure and dynamics of carnivore, folivore, and plant communities, and by experimental results. The general idea of top-down trophic dynamics is supported for other autotroph-based systems, too, but the relevance and sufficiency of the energy constraint in explaining patterns in trophic dynamics appears to be variable. Moreover, critical empirical evidence for or against the capacity of folivorous insects to regulate plant biomass has not yet been obtained. Another open question is the ability of boreal and temperate browsers, evolved in productive environments with intense predation pressure and abundance of forage, to prevent the regeneration of the least palatable tree species. There are, thus, many open questions waiting to be answered and many exciting experiments waiting to be conducted.","Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Oksanen, L (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",lauri.oksanen@eg.umu.se,,,,,,224,243,249,2,152,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Partitioning of space and time can reduce competition by decreasing the frequency of interspecific encounters that exploit a common resource base. We investigated temporal and spatial partitioning of tigers (Panthers tigris), leopards (Panthera pardus), dholes (Cuon alpinus), and their ungulate prey in Thung Yai Naresuan (East) Wildlife Sanctuary in western Thailand from April 2010 to January 2012. We collected camera trap data from 106 locations over 1,817 trap nights. Kernel density estimation and Spearnian's rank correlation were used to quantify temporal and spatial activity patterns. Pianka's index was used to investigate the temporal and spatial overlap for each species pair. Tigers (crepuscular activity pattern) showed no temporal correlation with leopards (mostly diurnal) or dholes (strongly diurnal), but leopard activity appeared to correlate positively with dhole activity. Tigers exhibited temporal overlap with larger gaur (Bos gaurus) and sambar (Rusa unicolor); leopards did so with barking deer (Muntiacus munqak) and wild boar (Sus scrota); and dholes did so with barking deer and wild boar. The spatial correlations of tigers, leopards, and dholes did not significantly overlap, though numerically overlap was higher between felids than with the canid. None of the three predators significantly correlated with prey distribution, except for dholes with sambar. Our findings suggest that tigers, leopards, and dholes co-occur with spatial and temporal partitioning due to differences in prey activity and low overlap in space use correlated to prey preference. The partition in space and time between tigers and leopards can minimise their competition-associated prey activity, while leopards and dholes seem to be more generalist and not spatially correlated with each other.","[Vinitpornsawan, Supagit; Fuller, Todd K.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Vinitpornsawan, Supagit] Wildlife Conservat Off, Natl Pk Wildlife & Plant Conservat Dept, 61 Paholyathin Rd, Bangkok 10900, Thailand","Fuller, TK (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",tkfuller@eco.umass.edu,,,"Wildlife Conservation Society; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: Rhino-Tiger Conservation Fund; Thailand Wildlife Research Division, Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation","We acknowledge the Wildlife Conservation Society; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: Rhino-Tiger Conservation Fund; and the Thailand Wildlife Research Division, Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation for supporting this work.

Using a microcosm experiment manipulating microcrustacean communities of Mediterranean temporary wetlands (Camargue, Southern France), we tested the following hypotheses: (i) large branchiopods (the notostracan Triops cancriformis and the anostracan Chirocephalus diaphanus) can limit microcrustacean densities through both competition and predation; (ii) notostracans create high suspended-matter concentrations through bioturbation, which can negatively impact microcrustaceans; and (iii) the outcome of these biotic interactions is more detrimental at high salinities. We found a strong predatory impact of T. cancriformis on active microcrustacean populations, but also on dormant populations through the consumption of resting eggs. They also preyed on anostracans and their conspecifics and can indirectly have a negative effect on microcrustaceans through bioturbation, probably by impeding filtering capacities. The presence of C. diaphanus also limited most microcrustacean groups, probably through competition and/or predation. We did not find a significant effect of the tested salinity range (0.5-2.5 g L-1) on the biotic interactions. Our study shows that large branchiopods can shape microcrustacean communities under a wide range of environmental conditions and confirms their potential for a keystone role, especially one of notostracans as top predators.","[Waterkeyn, Aline; Vanschoenwinkel, Bram; Brendonck, Luc] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Waterkeyn, Aline; Grillas, Patrick] Tour Valat, Res Ctr Mediterranean Wetlands, F-13200 Arles, France; [Anton-Pardo, Maria] Univ Valencia, Dept Microbiol & Ecol, E-46100 Valencia, Spain","Waterkeyn, A (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Charles Deberiotstr 32, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",aline.waterkeyn@bio.kuleuven.be,"Vanschoenwinkel, Bram/I-9021-2019; Anton-Pardo, Maria/G-5156-2015","Vanschoenwinkel, Bram/0000-0002-8973-6297; Anton-Pardo, Maria/0000-0003-1722-9867; Brendonck, Luc/0000-0001-5383-1420",Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT Vlaanderen)Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT); French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANRBIODIVERSITE ANR-05-BDIV-014],This study was funded by a Ph.D. grant from the Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT Vlaanderen) and by a grant from the French National Research Agency (ANRBIODIVERSITE ANR-05-BDIV-014).

Little is known about how interaction of these chemicals with other biotic and abiotic stressors impact mosquito populations. We used two levels of nutrient (low and high) and four larval densities (10, 20, 30, 40) to examine the effects of low concentrations of insecticide malathion, on Culex pipiens L mosquitoes experiencing stress from larval competition. Addition of malathion at the high nutrient condition enhanced survival with increasing larval densities, but this effect was not observed at low nutrient condition. Males exposed to malathion were significantly larger than those from control treatments while the effect of malathion on size of females varied with larval density and the level of nutrients. Larval exposure to malathion and low nutrient resulted in significantly larger females with increases in larval densities compared with other treatments. The effect of malathion on male longevity varied with larval density and amount of nutrients. At higher densities, male longevity was consistently higher in low nutrient than in high nutrient conditions and addition of malathion in high nutrient treatment increased male longevity at the highest density. These effects are most likely attributable to release from competition among survivors after mortality from malathion and density-dependent effects. We conclude that biotic conditions of the larval habitat can alter the impact of low concentrations of chemical contaminants on mosquito populations in ways that may influence the pattern of disease transmission and the outcome of vector control efforts.

As an example we simulated predator-induced behavioural changes in a roach (Rutilus rutilus (L.)) population before and after stocking a take with an additional pelagic predator (Sander lucioperca (L.)). By this it was possible to calculate bioenergetic gains and costs of trait changes as well as the relative proportions of DMIIs and TMIIs in roach consumption on littoral and pelagic resources in the take food web. Despite higher net activity costs of 64%, roach migrating horizontally over the diet cycle had a net benefit (higher energy intake of 75%) compared to roach that were restricted to the littoral as a behavioural response to the new predator. By separating the components of the indirect predator effects, we demonstrate that a predator-induced modification in prey traits (behaviour, feeding activity) could contribute substantially to the net indirect effect of a predator even when there are strong density effects. When considering the predation pressure by roach on pelagic resources, the net TMIIs due to the behavioural adaptation of the consumer in response to the predator were 13-14 times stronger than the DMIIs atone. When comparing the different effects on littoral resources it can be shown that the TMIIs approximately compensate the DMIIs thus resulting in a nearly zero net effect. (c) 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

We used cages with different sizes of mesh to exclude fish of different sizes. Sizes of mesh were chosen following observations that there were small ( < 200 mm TL) and large ( > 200 mm TL) predatory fish at the study site. Predation by fish was intense on oysters and directly or indirectly reduced the density of the gastropod, Bembicium auratum. The cover of algae was positively affected by predation, possibly because predation on oysters created more space for algae. Predation by small fish (toadfish) was intense, but the effects of large fish were negligible. Predation was, however, independent of the sizes of experimental panels (i.e. area foraged) over the range examined (5 x 5, 10 x XO, 20 x 20 cm).

This is because 1) small scale (local) processes may be constrained by large-scale (regional) processes, 2) the influence of organism movement changes with spatial scale, and 3) multiple small-scale processes may interact and produce variation that obscures large-scale patterns. Most ecologists would like to know the relevance of small-scale observations and experiments for large-scale patterns and processes acting over long time periods. In this paper we consider whether patterns of individual behavior translate in a straightforward way to patterns in population dynamics, community structure or individual fitness at larger spatial and longer temporal scales. We illustrate our discussion with data from communities living in high altitude streams in western Colorado, coastal streams in southern California, and streams on the South Island of New Zealand. We describe patterns of individual behavior including selective predation, predator-avoidance behavior, and competitive interactions. Our examples indicate that large scale patterns of distribution and abundance of organisms sometimes deviate from those expected from patterns of individual behavior. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are often due to multiple confounding factors, including abiotic disturbances, that have effects on populations and communities at larger scales. Similarly, our data illustrate that present behaviors may not have measurable fitness consequences over longer time scales. We emphasize that only by studying all life history stages of organisms with complex life cycles can we interpret the long-term fitness consequences of individual behaviors. We conclude that our ability to extrapolate from individual behaviors to populations and communities in streams will improve when we consider the repercussions of individual behaviors and environmental factors over broader spatial and temporal scales.","CORNELL UNIV,DEPT ENTOMOL,ITHACA,NY 14853",,,"McIntosh, Angus/B-2992-2011","McIntosh, Angus/0000-0003-2696-8813",,,,119,91,92,2,26,NORTH AMER BENTHOLOGICAL SOC,LAWRENCE,"1041 NEW HAMSPHIRE STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",0887-3593,,,J N AM BENTHOL SOC,J.

In this follow-up study, interest was focused on determining whether female pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca tend to use the field layer more frequently than other types of feeding niches. In addition, the degree to which the conspicuousness of a larva increases the risk of its being preyed upon by birds was evaluated in order to further understand the mechanisms regulating the bird predation effect. Larval predation risks were measured by presenting larvae with contrasting characteristics to seven captured female flycatchers, Female flycatchers hunted more frequently in the tree and field layers than in the air. However, the relative degree of utilization of the tree and field layer varied considerably between years, with use of field layer being positively related to the abundance of insect larvae on bilberry. Large larvae did not suffer higher bird predation than small larvae when both size classes were presented to the birds on bilberry. Larvae that crawl on leaves and stems during feeding (high degree of exposure) were preyed upon more than larvae that feed between leaves they have spun together (low degree of exposure). No difference in larval predation risk was found between sawflies and geometrics, the two taxa represented in the exposed feeder group. However, dark geometrics suffered higher predation than green sawflies and green geometrics. My findings suggest that the herbivorous larva guild constitutes an abundant food resource frequently utilized by small bird predators. However, certain members of the guild appeared to be preyed upon more than other members. Thus the risk for predation seems to be highest for dark geometrics followed in decreasing order by green geometrics, sawflies, pyralids, and tortricids.",,"ATLEGRIM, O (corresponding author), SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI,DEPT WILDLIFE ECOL,S-90183 UMEA,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,27,28,28,0,6,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0906-7590,,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,JAN-MAR,1992,15,1,,,,,19,24,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.1992.tb00003.x,,,6,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HX620,WOS:A1992HX62000003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Following the accidental introduction of the bostrichid beetle Prostephanus truncatus into East and West Africa around 1980, a classical biological control campaign was launched in 1991; the histerid beetle Teretrius nigrescens was released as a biocontrol agent to prevent the destructive outbreak of the pest in small-farm maize stores. However, while the campaign has been ongoing, so has discussion in the scientific community about the merits of this campaign and its chances of success. 2. From published and unpublished data from experimental maize stores in Benin, West Africa, we derived statistical models describing the in-store insect population dynamics, and were thus able to point out significant biological interactions and to explain the observed lack of biological control. 3. We found that (i) T. nigrescens reduced significantly the population growth rate of both P. truncatus and the non-target pest, the weevil Sitophilus zeamais ; (ii) T. nigrescens displayed a positive numerical response to both prey species, P. truncatus and S. zeamais ; (iii) asymmetric competition existed between the two prey species, S. zeamais was negatively affected by P. truncatus but not vice versa; (iv) T. nigrescens and S. zeamais displayed negative intraspecific density-dependence whereas P. truncatus was resource-limited. 4. We conclude that classical biological control with T. nigrescens is not likely to become successful, mainly due to the predator's intraspecific density-dependence and its low population growth rate compared with its prey. We recommend that further research on P. truncatus integrated pest management takes into account the farmer as an active agent managing the store. 5. Synthesis and applications. When biocontrol does not result in satisfactory pest control, as in the case of P. truncatus , farmers should learn how to scout for the pest and take action when a need is detected. In areas where the pest is usually only a minor problem, the agricultural extension service should consider setting up a simple early warning system for their region. When attempts at classical biological control remain unsuccessful, as in the case of P. truncatus now for 10 years, policy-makers should prioritize training of extension service and farmers in integrated pest management techniques (e.g. need-based use of insecticides) as a necessary supplement to biocontrol.","Danish Inst Agr Sci, Dept Crop Protect, DK-4200 Slagelse, Denmark; Int Inst Trop Agr, Cotonou 08, Benin","Holst, N (corresponding author), Danish Inst Agr Sci, Dept Crop Protect, DK-4200 Slagelse, Denmark.",niels.holst@agrsci.dk,,"Holst, Niels/0000-0002-8414-6773; Meikle, William/0000-0002-1759-6950",,,,49,10,10,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The predator effects may vary with diet specialisation, the associated risk posed to prey and, if multiple predators are present, the predator-predator interactions. We examined the spatiotemporal distribution of the herbivorous spider mite Tetranychus urticae and the associated specialist and generalist predators Phytoseiulus persimilis and Neoseiulus californicus on bean plants. Tetranychus urticae is a key pest on numerous agricultural crops. Both predators are used singly and in combination for biological control of spider mites. Population development and within-plant distribution of the spider mites and the predators were compared among five treatments: T. urticae without predators, with either predator alone and with both predators in combination at full and half densities. The spider mites were suppressed to zero density in both predator combination treatments but not in the single predator treatments. The predators determined the spatiotemporal distribution of the spider mites through density- and behaviour-mediated effects, and these effects were linked to diet specialisation. The specialist P. persimilis exerted stronger density-mediated effects on the spider mite distribution than did the generalist N. californicus. Either predator induced in the spider mites early upward migration on plants. The predators also affected each other's distribution. The aggregation level of N. californicus was lowered by P. persimilis but not vice versa. In combination, the predators were more dispersed than when alone, reducing the predator-free space and leading to the local extinction of T. urticae.","[Walzer, A.; Schausberger, P.] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Dept Appl Plant Sci & Plant Biotechnol, Inst Plant Protect, Vienna, Austria; [Moder, K.] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Dept Landscape Spatial & Infrastruct Sci, Inst Appl Stat & Comp, Vienna, Austria","Walzer, A (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Dept Appl Plant Sci & Plant Biotechnol, Inst Plant Protect, Vienna, Austria.",andreas.walzer@boku.ac.at,,"Schausberger, Peter/0000-0002-1529-3198",Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; European Community (CRAFT)European Commission,Andreas Walzer was financially supported by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the European Community (CRAFT).,,56,21,22,0,32,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0007-4853,,,B ENTOMOL RES,Bull.

Various research strategies and treatment programs for achieving the objective of eradicating schistosomiasis within a decade have been recommended and supported by the World Health Organization. One of these approaches is based on the control of snail vectors in endemic areas. Previous field studies have shown that competitor or predator introduction can reduce snail numbers, but no systematic investigation has ever been conducted to identify snail microbial pathogens and evaluate their molluscicidal effects. Methodology/Principal findings In populations of Biomphalaria glabrata snails experiencing high mortalities, white nodules were visible on snail bodies. Infectious agents were isolated from such nodules. Only one type of bacteria, identified as a new species of Paenibacillus named Candidatus Paenibacillus glabratella, was found, and was shown to be closely related to P. alvei through 16S and Rpob DNA analysis. Histopathological examination showed extensive bacterial infiltration leading to overall tissue disorganization. Exposure of healthy snails to Paenibacillus-infected snails caused massive mortality. Moreover, eggs laid by infected snails were also infected, decreasing hatching but without apparent effects on spawning. Embryonic lethality was correlated with the presence of pathogenic bacteria in eggs. Conclusions/Significance This is the first account of a novel Paenibacillus strain, Ca. Paenibacillus glabratella, as a snail microbial pathogen. Since this strain affects both adult and embryonic stages and causes significant mortality, it may hold promise as a biocontrol agent to limit schistosomiasis transmission in the field.","[Duval, David; Galinier, Richard; Mouahid, Gabriel; Toulza, Eve; Allienne, Jean Francois; Portela, Julien; Calvayrac, Christophe; Rognon, Anne; Arancibia, Nathalie; Mitta, Guillaume; Theron, Andre; Gourbal, Benjamin] CNRS, UMR 5244, 2EI, Perpignan, France; [Duval, David; Galinier, Richard; Mouahid, Gabriel; Toulza, Eve; Allienne, Jean Francois; Portela, Julien; Rognon, Anne; Arancibia, Nathalie; Mitta, Guillaume; Theron, Andre; Gourbal, Benjamin] Univ Perpignan, F-66025 Perpignan, France; [Calvayrac, Christophe] EA 4215, LCBE, Perpignan, France","Duval, D (corresponding author), CNRS, UMR 5244, 2EI, Perpignan, France.",david.duval@univ-perp.fr,"MITTA, Guillaume/A-6489-2010; Theron, Andre/B-2848-2010; Portela, Julien/AAX-8902-2020; GOURBAL, Benjamin E.F./B-3743-2010; ALLIENNE, Jean-Francois/B-9594-2011; Mouahid, Gabriel/F-3625-2010; Galinier, Richard/G-8278-2011; Toulza, Eve/A-9919-2012; Rognon, Anne/G-7935-2011; DUVAL, David/B-8586-2011","Portela, Julien/0000-0001-9384-0049; GOURBAL, Benjamin E.F./0000-0003-2097-2563; Toulza, Eve/0000-0003-2049-2279; Duval, David/0000-0001-6933-3354; allienne, jean-francois/0000-0001-6343-308X; Galinier, Richard/0000-0002-4180-9303; mitta, guillaume/0000-0003-1188-1467",Centre National de la Recherche (CNRS)Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Perpignan Via Domitia (UPVD); ANR JCJC INVIMORYFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-13-JSV7-0009],"This work was supported by funds from the Centre National de la Recherche (CNRS) and the Universite de Perpignan Via Domitia (UPVD), and by a grant from the ANR JCJC INVIMORY number ANR-13-JSV7-0009.

This intertidal zone is characterized by a high level of sand movement preventing any establishment of sessile organisms on the vertical sides of rock outcrops. The coast is prone to potential spills from nearby hydrocarbon marine platforms, but this benthic assemblage has been poorly studied. In February 2001, we exposed the assemblage to two different experimental conditions: a complete removal of bivalves and a physical disturbance and tracked its recovery during the following 4 years. The disturbance lowered the diversity of associated fauna and made the sediment layer trapped among bivalves disappear, which was not restored. Mytilus chilensis was recruited into crevices or between byssi in the following settlement season, i.e. summer 2002. The recuperation of mussel coverage to predisturbance levels took 3 years after the total removal. In April 2004 the size frequency distributions, density and biomass/number ratio of M. chilensis were similar to those at the start of the experiment. Perumytilus purpuratus recovered more slowly than M. chilensis, probably due to its slower growth rate compared to M. chilensis and dependence on an adequate byssus matrix for settlement. The main apparent stressor was the irruption of sand, covering the bivalve assemblage for variable periods of time. This bivalve assemblage is characterized by low predatory pressure and therefore we hypothesize that it is predominantly controlled by competition for space.","[Angel Calcagno, Javier; Natalia Curelovich, Jessica] Univ Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Inst Ecol Genet & Evoluc, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Angel Calcagno, Javier; Natalia Curelovich, Jessica; Fernandez, Vanessa Maribel; Alejandro Lovrich, Gustavo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Fernandez, Vanessa Maribel] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Inst Fisiol Biol Mol & Neurociencias, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Thatje, Sven] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England; [Alejandro Lovrich, Gustavo] Ctr Austral Invest Cient, Ushuaia, Tierra del Fueg, Argentina","Calcagno, JA (corresponding author), Univ Maimonides, Inst Super Invest, Ctr Estudios Biomed Biotecnol Ambient & Diagnost, Hidalgo 775,C1405BWE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",jkalcagno@gmail.com,,"Lovrich, Gustavo/0000-0001-8424-6566",Argentinean Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica [PICT 1385]; CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"This study was funded by the Argentinean Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (PICT 1385).

Interspecific competition with larger carnivores may be a factor limiting wild dog density. The density of wild dogs on a 2600-km(2) area of the Selous Game Reserve (Tanzania) was 0.04 adults/km(2). Spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) density for the same area was estimated by audio playbacks as 0.32 hyaenas/km(2). Lion (Panthera leo) density determined from the ratio of hyaenas to lions, was 0.11 lions/km(2). Across six ecosystems including Selous, there were strong negative correlations between wild dog and hyaena densities (r = -0.32; p = 0.01) and between wild dog and lion densities (r = -0.91; p = 0.03). Hyaenas out-numbered wild dogs by ratios ranging from 8.1 to 122:1. Ratios of lions to wild dogs ranged from 3:1 to 21:1. The diets of hyaenas and wild dogs overlap extensively; those of wild dogs and lions show less overlap. Where hyaenas are common and visibility is good, interference competition from hyaenas at wild dog kills is common and reduces wild dogs' feeding time. Where hyaena density is lower and visibility is poor, interference competition at wild dog kills is rare. Wild dogs are commonly killed by lions and occasionally by hyaenas. These data suggest that competition with spotted hyaenas may limit or exclude wild dogs when hyaena density is high. Competition with lions appears less intense, but direct predation by lions on wild dogs is important. Competition and predation by larger carnivores may be of broad importance to the conservation of wild dogs and other medium-sized carnivores.","FRANKFURT ZOOL SOC, SELOUS WILD DOG PROJECT, SELOUS CONSERVAT PROGRAMME, DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA","Creel, S (corresponding author), ROCKEFELLER UNIV, FIELD RES CTR ECOL & ETHOL, TYRREL RD, BOX 38B, RR2, MILLBROOK, NY 12545 USA.",,,,,,,55,236,237,0,156,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Neither food limitation nor fish predation appeared to be important constraints on C. punctipennis abundance. Although rotifer biomass increased significantly during the acidification, C. punctipennis did not respond in a consistent manner to variation in food availability. Bioenergetics estimates of C. punctipennis consumption by rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), the most acid-sensitive fish species, were small compared with C. punctipennis production. In contrast, invertebrate predation appeared to be an important constraint on C. punctipennis abundance. Chaoborus punctipennis abundance increased dramatically when abundance of the predator Mesocyclops edax declined to near zero. Comparison of M. edax predation rates and first instar production suggested that M. edax could exert strong predation pressure on C. punctipennis Thus, invertebrate predation may create a juvenile bottleneck for populations of small-bodied Chaoborus species in moderately productive acidified lakes.",,"Fischer, JM (corresponding author), UNIV WISCONSIN, CTR LIMNOL, 680 N PK ST, MADISON, WI 53706 USA.",,,,,,,48,23,23,2,10,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Male sociality along with solitary females is rare in mammals, but it can provide unique insights into the evolution of sociality and cooperation. Because males compete with each other over females, male cooperation in mammals has been explained by joint defense of females against other males. Here, we demonstrate that the benefits of male cooperative hunting can play a major role in shaping sociality. By quantifying differences in morphology, activity, diet, and mating success, we show that in Madagascar's top predator, the fosa (Cryptoprocta ferox), some males associate to jointly hunt large prey, which allows them to grow bigger than both solitary males and females. These associated males' physical superiority also represents an advantage in contest competition for females, as reflected by higher mating success. Our results demonstrate that enhanced access to food resources by cooperative hunting is a key to physical development and competitiveness in fosas. In contrast to previous findings, we show that male sociality must not be limited to joint defense of territory and females, but that cooperation in food acquisition can favor sociality in sexually dimorphic species.","[Luehrs, Mia-Lana; Kappeler, Peter] Univ Gottingen, Dept Sociobiol Anthropol, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Dammhahn, Melanie; Kappeler, Peter] Leibniz Inst Primate Res, German Primate Ctr, Behav Ecol & Sociobiol Unit, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Luhrs, ML (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Sociobiol Anthropol, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, Kellnerweg 6, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",mluehrs@gwdg.de,"Dammhahn, Melanie/AAD-5479-2019; Kappeler, Peter/B-6825-2012",,Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG KA 1082/17-1]; Fossa Fund of Zoo Duisburg AG; German Primate Center GmbH (DPZ),"This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG KA 1082/17-1), the Fossa Fund of Zoo Duisburg AG, and the German Primate Center GmbH (DPZ).

One example of this kin bias is behaving less aggressively toward a relative than a non-relative, a behavior which yields inclusive fitness benefits. However, data are lacking about the ability of animals to weigh their preference for kinship and the density of conspecifics simultaneously and to respond accordingly. Fire salamanders (Salamandra infraimmaculata) larviposit in high densities in ponds. Thus, larvae of different females confront competition and predation by other larvae. We studied whether larvae prefer their kin over particular density or vice versa. We experimentally used a transparent glass aquarium with inner chambers to test the responses of a focal larva toward its siblings and non-siblings. Specifically, we quantified the time a focal larva spent near its siblings or non-siblings, presented in varying densities, and the aggression level it demonstrated. We found that focal larvae spent more time near non-siblings if non-sibling and sibling groups were of equal density. The focal larvae were also more aggressive toward non-siblings. The results may be explained by the cannibalistic nature of these larvae: high density may provide more opportunities for food, especially when non-siblings are present. Further explanations for these findings may include other advantages of staying in a larger group and/or the stronger olfactory and visual stimulation offered by groups compared to a single individual. These findings suggest that larvae make differential responses toward conspecifics depending simultaneously on the level of relatedness and the density of the group. Such responses have important implications for social-aggregation decisions and may especially affect the fitness of cannibalistic species.","[Berkowic, Daniel; Markman, Shai] Univ Haifa, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Biol & Environm, Tivon, Israel","Markman, S (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Biol & Environm, Tivon, Israel.",markmans@research.haifa.ac.il,,"Markman, Shai/0000-0002-0484-3801",,,,44,0,0,1,5,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,AUG 5,2019,14,8,,,,,,,e0220499,10.1371/journal.pone.0220499,,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,IW5BL,WOS:000484993600018,31381581,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-27,

However, adding litter does not allow separating the effects of food availability and habitat space. We investigated the response of decomposers and predators to increased food resources and space in forests of the southern Mata Atlantica of Brazil. In two forest ecosystems representing an early successional stage of secondary forests and old-growth forest, we added nutrient-rich organic material, artificial litter of no nutritional value, or a combination of both to the soil surface of 120 plots to separate the effects of habitat space and food on soil food webs. We sampled litter-and soil-dwelling arthropods after three months using pitfall traps, soil sample extraction, and sticky traps just above the soil. Adding artificial litter had no positive effect on any of the 17 analyzed arthropod groups. Combining all sampled arthropods the effect was even significantly negative. Adding food had a positive effect on the abundance of decomposers, but not predators. We found no interactions between added artificial litter and added organic material. Our results suggest that the soil fauna in tropical forests is food limited. The lack of a bottom-up effect on predators suggests that they are not predominantly regulated by the abundance of epigeic prey but rather by competition or predation.","[Raub, Florian; Hoefer, Hubert] Staatl Museum Naturkunde Karlsruhe, D-76133 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Brandl, Roland] Univ Marburg, D-35043 Marburg, Germany","Raub, F (corresponding author), Staatl Museum Naturkunde Karlsruhe, Erbprinzenstr 13, D-76133 Karlsruhe, Germany.",florian.raub@smnk.de,,"Hofer, Hubert/0000-0003-3962-151X",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF-sig.)

Here, we repeatedly sampled the macroinvertebrate communities in 16 permanent and 14 temporary wetlands in Alberta, Canada. Temporary wetlands were predicted to have more closely related taxa and reduced species richness due to the specialized adaptations required to survive in a temporary habitat. We analyzed the species richness (SR) and phylogenetic structure of communities, focusing on three measures of relatedness: Phylogenetic Distance (PD), Net Related Index (NRI) and Nearest Taxon Index (NTI). We also examined the influence of taxonomic scale on resulting phylogenetic structure. Overall, taxa were more diverse and abundant in permanent wetlands. As expected, PD and SR were greatest in permanent wetlands. NTI and NRI metrics suggest permanent wetland communities are primarily structured by biotic interactions, such as competition and predation. Conversely, temporary wetland communities appear to be affected more by environmental filtering, with fewer groups being able to survive and reproduce in the relatively limited time that these environments contain water. Insect and dipteran assemblages differed from the patterns found when examining all taxa together for communities for both permanent and temporary wetlands, tending to become more phylogenetically clustered as the season progressed. Conversely, lophotrochozoan and gastropod assemblages closely matched the patterns observed for full communities in permanent wetlands, suggesting a role for biotic interactions. Given the contrasting patterns observed for permanent and temporary wetlands, macroinvertebrate diversity at the landscape level may be best conserved by maintaining both habitat types.

Humans affect carnivores in both spatial and temporal dimensions via the chance of human encounter and alteration of the landscape through urban development. We investigated three hypotheses regarding how humans mediate the sympatry of larger, dominant carnivores with their smaller, subordinate counterparts. We tested these hypotheses by examining the spatio-temporal dynamics of a dominant carnivore (coyote Canis latrans) and its subordinate competitor (red fox Vulpes vulpes) across an extensive urban park system. We found that dominant and subordinate carnivores exhibited strong and often opposing spatio-temporal responses to the probability of human encounter and urban development. Spatially, coyotes visited more highly developed sites less frequently while red foxes exhibited an opposing response. Temporally, both species avoided humans via nocturnal activity. Spatio-temporally, red foxes avoided coyotes at all sites and avoided humans at highly developed sites, whereas coyotes showed a positive association with humans at such sites. Our analysis indicates that areas with higher urban development might act as spatial refugia for some subordinate carnivores against interference from larger, dominant carnivores (a human shield effect). Our findings also reveal that broad-scale spatial avoidance is likely a crucial component of coexistence between larger, dominant carnivores and humans, whereas finer-scale spatio-temporal avoidance is likely a key feature of coexistence between humans and smaller, subordinate carnivores. Overall, our study underscores the complex and pervasive nature of human influence over the sympatry of competing carnivores inhabiting urban systems.","[Moll, Remington J.; Montgomery, Robert A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 480 Wilson Rd,Room 13 Nat Resources Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Cepek, Jonathon D.] Cleveland Metropk, Nat Resources, 9485 Eastland Rd, Strongsville, OH 44149 USA; [Lorch, Patrick D.; Robison, Terry] Cleveland Metropk, Nat Resources, 2277 West Ridgewood Dr, Parma, OH 44134 USA; [Dennis, Patricia M.] Cleveland Metropk Zoo, Conservat & Sci, 3900 Wildlife Way, Cleveland, OH 44109 USA; [Dennis, Patricia M.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Vet Prevent Med, 1920 Coffey Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Millspaugh, Joshua J.] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Moll, RJ (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 480 Wilson Rd,Room 13 Nat Resources Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",rjmoll@msu.edu,,,National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We are grateful to Cleveland Metroparks and Michigan State University staff, students, and volunteers who contributed to field work and data preparation, especially E.

Sponges are now the primary habitat-forming organisms on Caribbean coral reefs. Recent species-level investigations have demonstrated that predatory fishes (angelfishes and some parrotfishes) differentially graze sponges that lack chemical defenses, while co-occurring, palatable species heal, grow, reproduce, or recruit at faster rates than defended species. Our prediction, based on resource allocation theory, was that predator removal would result in a greater proportion of palatable species in the sponge community on overfished reefs. We tested this prediction by performing surveys of sponge and fish community composition on reefs having different levels of fishing intensity across the Caribbean. A total of 109 sponge species was recorded from 69 sites, with the 10 most common species comprising 51.0% of sponge cover (3.6-7.7% per species). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling indicated that the species composition of sponge communities depended more on the abundance of sponge-eating fishes than geographic location. Across all sites, multiple-regression analyses revealed that spongivore abundance explained 32.8% of the variation in the proportion of palatable sponges, but when data were limited to geographically adjacent locations with strongly contrasting levels of fishing pressure (Cayman Islands and Jamaica; Curacao, Bonaire, and Martinique), the adjusted R-2 values were much higher (76.5% and 94.6%, respectively). Overfishing of Caribbean coral reefs, particularly by fish trapping, removes sponge predators and is likely to result in greater competition for space between faster-growing palatable sponges and endangered reef-building corals.","[Pawlik, Joseph R.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol & Marine Biol, Wilmington, NC 28409 USA; Univ N Carolina, Ctr Marine Sci, Wilmington, NC 28409 USA","Pawlik, JR (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol & Marine Biol, Wilmington, NC 28409 USA.",pawlikj@uncw.edu,"Pawlik, Joseph R/I-5718-2012","Pawlik, Joseph/0000-0002-8559-8456; Loh, Tse-Lynn/0000-0003-1360-1991","American Museum of Natural History Lerner Gray Fund for Marine Research; University of North Carolina Wilmington Brauer Fellowship; Graduate Student Association Travel Award; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-National Undersea Research Center [NA96RU-0260]; NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation ProgramNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0550468, 1029515]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1227093] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank survey team members Steve McMurray, Tim Henkel, and Jan Vicente, and collaborators and staff from Aquarius Reef Base, St. Eustatius National Marine Park, Soufriere Marine Management Association (St. Lucia), Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute Bocas Station (Panama), Caribbean Research and Management of Biodiversity (Curacao), Punta Cana Ecological Foundation (Dominican Republic), Discovery Bay Marine Laboratory (Jamaica), Action Adventure Divers (St. Lucia), Scubafun Dive Center (Dominican Republic), Espace Plongee Martinique, the governments of the Bahamas and Mexico, and the crew of R/V Walton Smith, who variously facilitated permits and provided valuable logistical and field support.

We tested the effects of food, in the form of leaf litter, and density on population growth and fitness correlates of the tree hole mosquito Aedes triseriatus. Our field experiment used a 2 x 2 randomized block design, with three holes as blocks. In cages within three holes, we manipulated densities of Aedes triseriatus larvae, and presence of leaf litter. Our laboratory experiment used a 2 x 3 factorial design in which we also manipulated densities of larvae and availability of leaf litter within similar cages (inside, outside, or absent). For both experiments we determined effects on survival, days to and mass at eclosion of both sexes, and a composite index of population performance lambda', that estimates finite rate of increase. 2. In the field experiment, we found significant and large effects of leaf litter and of density on the performance of A. triseriatus. The effect of density did not depend on leaf litter availability. We documented significant variation among tree holes for most correlates of fitness. Often, the effects of treatments varied significantly depending on the tree hole tested. 3. In the laboratory experiment we found significant effects of density and litter, and that direct browsing on leaf litter is necessary for the effect of litter on performance of A. triseriatus. In the laboratory, the negative effect of increased density was dependent on leaf litter availability. 4. Our results demonstrate that leaf litter has important effects on population performance of tree hole mosquitoes in natural tree holes, Direct browsing on the surface of leaf litter is the most likely mechanism by which litter enhances population growth. The impact of litter on populations varies among tree holes.","ILLINOIS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,ECOL GRP,NORMAL,IL 61790",,,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553",,,,36,92,95,1,27,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Theoretically, spatial overlap (considered the opposite of territoriality) and food availability are related in a nonlinear manner (hypothesized inverted-U function), with high overlap levels at the extremes of a food availability gradient and low overlap at intermediate levels of this gradient. Similar patterns are expected for encounter frequencies owing to its expected correlation with spatial overlap. However, these predictions have rarely been tested in highly structured social systems on a broad gradient of food availability, which implicitly requires experimental manipulation. We test these predictions in a solitary, territorial and trophic specialist, the Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus, taking advantage of a three-decade data set of spatial behaviour in different scenarios of food availability (i.e. rabbit density). In contrast with expectations, home range overlap among resident females was low (median overlap index=0 center dot 08, range 0-0 center dot 57) and core area overlap was nearly nil (median overlap index=0, range 0-0 center dot 22) throughout the entire gradient of prey availability. Furthermore, spatial associations between pairs of females were negligible regardless marked variation in prey availability. Therefore, we did not find support for a model of flexible lynx territoriality driven by food availability. Our results suggest that the exclusive use of space in the Iberian lynx was not related to food. Lack of influence of prey availability on lynx territoriality may be adaptive to cope with the consequences of frequent drought-induced periods of prey scarcity or other disturbance typically affecting wild rabbit populations in Mediterranean environments. Thus, lynx would adopt an obstinate strategy of territoriality that consists in defending exclusive areas across a broad range of resource availability ensuring an exclusive access to the minimum amount of prey necessary for survival and eventually reproduction even during periods of prey scarcity. However, we found signs that territoriality was influenced by lynx density in a nonlinear fashion. Our results suggest the occurrence of population regulation through territoriality in this species.","[Lopez-Bao, Jose V.] Univ Oviedo, Res Unit Biodivers, UO, CSIC,PA, Mieres 33600, Spain; [Lopez-Bao, Jose V.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Rodriguez, Alejandro; Delibes, Miguel; Fedriani, Jose M.; Palomares, Francisco] CSIC, EBD, Dept Conservat Biol, Seville 41092, Spain; [Calzada, Javier] Univ Huelva, Dept Biol Ambiental & Salud Publ, Huelva 21071, Spain; [Ferreras, Pablo] JCCM, UCLM, CSIC, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget,IREC, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain","Lopez-Bao, JV (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, Res Unit Biodivers, UO, CSIC,PA, Mieres 33600, Spain.",jv.lopezbao@gmail.com,"Calzada, Javier/L-4853-2017; Delibes, Miguel/K-2744-2014; Ferreras, Pablo/A-6017-2009; Palomares, Francisco/F-5327-2016; Fedriani, Jose/R-1328-2018; Rodriguez, Alejandro/E-7709-2011","Calzada, Javier/0000-0001-5701-2238; Delibes, Miguel/0000-0002-3569-567X; Ferreras, Pablo/0000-0002-1116-6706; Palomares, Francisco/0000-0002-4655-7205; Fedriani, Jose/0000-0002-1581-2621; Rodriguez, Alejandro/0000-0001-9367-3420; Lopez-Bao, Jose Vicente/0000-0001-9213-998X","Spanish GovernmentSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2004-00346/BOS, 17/2005]; BP-Oil Spain; EUEuropean Commission [LIFE-02NAT/8609]; Spanish Ministry of EducationSpanish Government; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness","This research was funded by the Spanish Government (projects CGL2004-00346/BOS, 17/2005), BP-Oil Spain and the EU project LIFE-02NAT/8609.

J,"Bowles, J",,,,"Bowles, J",,,Shattered: Medawar's test tubes and their enduring legacy of chaos,MEDICAL HYPOTHESES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GERONTOLOGY; EVOLUTION,"Medawar's 1952 paper 'An Unsolved Problem of Biology' underlies most subsequent theoretical work regarding the evolution of aging; it concludes that aging is accidental and could not have evolved; this prevents reconciling the growing body of evidence suggesting the existence of multiple, evolved, aging systems. The paper features a well-known thought experiment using test tubes to show why aging could not evolve. Medawar assumes that constant, random, breakage sufficiently represents lethal forces of nature; however, famine, drought, predation, disease, and accidents each uniquely affect populations. Predation is the only evolving force that continually invents new ways to kill members of the prey populations; thus all prey defenses to predation will eventually be defeated. Defenses to non-evolving or non-obligate lethal forces, however, should quickly evolve. Thus unevolving, identical test tubes cannot adequately represent biological populations. The example also ignores population booms and busts which often occur in nature, By ignoring these issues, Medawar examines only one population age distribution skewed towards younger individuals in predator-dominated environments while ignoring predator-free populations skewed towards older individuals after population crashes. Further, Medawar's test tubes lack meaningful competition for finite resources, and ignore declining fertility which occurs in all aging species. Medawar concludes that older individuals are too few in number to influence the population's gene pool for or against aging. This conclusion is found to be incorrect when variations in the age of reproductive senescence are introduced into a predator-free population. A new thought experiment with competing strains of algae corrects for these issues and shows that aging evolved and is retained so that groups retain enough genetic variability to allow for rapid evolution of a defense to novel predation. The example shows reasons why the rate of aging is directly linked to the reproductive rate, litter size, metabolic rate, reproductive senescence, and fixed body size. It also suggests that in the absence of predation, immortality would quickly evolve if not for the evolution of highly-conserved aging systems. Prior analysis of aging evolution is incorrect due to theorists' rejection of the idea of group selection. It is believed to be 'impossible' to select for mutations that are bad for the individual but good for the group. However, mutations that are neutral to young individuals which are only deleterious if expressed at older ages can accumulate in early-mortality, predator-dominated environments. Removing the predator allows deleterious mutation expression. Positive group selection then occurs amongst traits that are negative to the individual. Further, group selection is a universal force that occurs between local, non-breeding groups and not, as theorists propose, between distant groups of potentially interbreeding species. Local survivors migrate to replace extinct, related species. The antagonistic pleiotropy theory, which was created to salvage the idea of accidental aging, is examined and shown to be untenable. The hypothetical antagonistic pleiotropy genes that are beneficial to young while detrimental to old individuals, predicted to exist in the 1950s, are unlikely to exist, have not, and likely will not be found in sufficient quantity to participate in the aging process.

The majority of such aggregations are associated with either the tellinid bivalve Macomona liliana (Iredale, 1915) or the venerid cockle Austrovenus stutchburyi (Wood, 1828). Marking experiments indicate that aggregations persist for one tidal cycle. This information, together with the density of aggregations associated with each 'prey' species allows the calculation of rate of predation by Cominella glandiformis and of the mortality of M. liliana and A. stutchburyi at different stations on the beach. Averaged over spring periods, when predation and mortality are reduced, and summer, the calculated rates suggest that between 2 to 16% of M. liliana and 3 to 9% of A. stutchburyi fall prey to Cominella each year. The majority of bivalves at the centre of aggregations appeared to be tightly shut and undamaged, suggesting that the gastropods are predators attacking live prey, although late arrivals may be attracted as scavengers by leaking body fluids. Aggregated feeding may provide the gastropod with both competitive and metabolic benefits.","Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Oban PA34 4AD, Argyll, Scotland","Ansell, AD (corresponding author), Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, POB 3, Oban PA34 4AD, Argyll, Scotland.",,,,,,,18,17,18,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0260-1230,,,J MOLLUS STUD,J.

The experiments showed that the fertility of female cats that mated with two partners was higher. Here, male reproductive success was less dependent on the attitude of females to the males, whereas the sperm quality (percentage of morphologically intact spermatozoa) and order of mating with the female had considerable effects on reproductive success. However, male sperm quality did not have a significant effect on the number of offspring if the mating pattern was monogamous.","[Erofeeva, M. N.; Alekseeva, G. S.; Sorokin, P. A.; Naidenko, S.

Aphids are indeed submitted to predation and therefore require protection, while ants are continuously looking for new sugar sources. The present work aimed to study the benefits that a mutualistic relationship with Lasius niger ( Hymenoptera, Formicidae) could bring to the black bean aphid Aphis fabae (Homoptera, Aphididae). Several parameters were observed in the field, on broad bean plants infested with an initial amount of 100 A. fabae and in presence or not of a L. niger colony. More aphids were observed on plants being visited by ants as well as a higher proportion of winged individuals. One explanation is that fewer predators were observed on plants being visited by ants, demonstrating their protective role. However, the number of parasitized aphids was not reduced in presence of L. niger. On the other hand, fewer different aphid species were present on plants foraged by ants, what suggests that they could exert a predation on unattended aphids. Our observations do not allow to conclude on any impact of L. niger on the fitness of the aphid host plant, although fewer exuvia and honeydew spots were observed when they were present. All these results confirm that L. niger increase the fitness of A. fabae colonies mainly by decreasing the number of predators and by reducing competition from aphid species unattended by ants.","[Verheggen, Francois; Diez, Lise; Haubruge, Eric] Gembloux Agr Univ, FUSAGx, Unite Entomol Fonct & Evolut, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; [Detrain, Claire] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Unite Ecol Sociale, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium","Verheggen, F (corresponding author), Gembloux Agr Univ, FUSAGx, Unite Entomol Fonct & Evolut, Passage Deportes 2, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium.",entomologie@fsagx.ac.be,,"Verheggen, Francois/0000-0002-5849-1661; Haubruge, Eric/0000-0002-8138-0476",,,,30,7,7,0,26,FAC UNIV SCIENCES AGRONOMIQUES GEMBLOUX,GEMBLOUX,"BIBLIOTHEQUE, PASSAGE DES DEPORTES 2, GEMBLOUX, 00000, BELGIUM",1370-6233,1780-4507,,BIOTECHNOL AGRON SOC,Biotechnol.

However, central place foraging species often have geographically isolated breeding colonies that are associated with markedly different habitats. South American fur seals Arctocephalus australis (SAFS) are abundant and widely distributed colonial breeding central place foragers that provide potentially useful insights into geographic variation in animal behaviour and resource use. However, SAFS movement ecology is poorly understood. To address knowledge gaps and to explicitly test geographic variation in behaviour, we examined the foraging behaviour of 9 adult female SAFS from 2 Falkland Islands breeding colonies separated in distance by 200 km. A total of 150 foraging trips over 7 mo revealed striking colony differences. Specifically, SAFS that bred at Volunteer Rocks undertook long foraging trips (mean +/- SD: 314 +/- 70 km and 15.2 +/- 2.7 d) to the Patagonian Shelf and shelf slope (bathymetric depth: 263 +/- 28 m). In contrast, SAFS that bred at North Fur Island undertook short foraging trips (94 +/- 40 km and 5.3 +/- 2.1 d) and typically foraged near the Falkland Islands' coastline (bathymetric depth: 85 +/- 24 m). Stable isotope analysis of vibrissae delta C-13 and delta N-15 values also revealed colony differences in the isotopic niche area occupied, which indicated that resource use also differed. Contrary to popular models (Ashmole's halo, hinterland model), colony size was unrelated to distance travelled, and SAFS did not necessarily use foraging grounds closest to their breeding colony. SAFS are likely subject to different selective pressures related to different environmental demands at the 2 breeding colonies. Accordingly, we reason that behavioural differences between breeding colonies reflect different phenotypes, and habitat use is more immediately influenced by phenotype, philopatry and the local environment, rather than density-dependent competition typically attributed to colony segregation in foraging areas.","[Baylis, Alastair M.

There is also little information on whether changes in vegetation structure commonly associated with spatial variation in subsidies may play an important role in driving consumer responses to subsidies. To address these knowledge gaps, we studied changes in abundance, diet, trophic position, size, and body condition of two congeneric gecko species (Lepidodactylus spp.) that coexist in palm dominated and native (hereafter dicot dominated) forests across the Central Pacific. These forests differ strongly both in the amount of marine subsidies that they receive from seabird guano and carcasses, and in the physical structure of the habitat. Contrary to other studies, we found that subsidy level had no impact on the abundance of either gecko species; it also did not have any apparent effects on resource partitioning between species. However, it did affect body size, dietary composition, and trophic position of both species. Geckos in subsidized, dicot forests were larger, had higher body condition and more diverse diets, and occupied a much higher trophic position than geckos found in palm dominated, low subsidy level forests. Both direct variation in subsidy levels and associated changes in habitat structure appear to play a role in driving these responses. These results suggest that variation in subsidy levels may drive important behavioral responses in predators, even when their numerical response is limited. Strong changes in trophic position of consumers also suggest that subsidies may drive increasingly complex food webs, with longer overall food chain length.","[Briggs, Amy A.; Young, Hillary S.; McCauley, Douglas J.; Dirzo, Rodolfo] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hathaway, Stacie A.; Fisher, Robert N.] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, San Diego Field Stn, San Diego, CA USA","Briggs, AA (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",hyoung@fas.harvard.edu,"Young, Hillary/S-1514-2017","Briggs, Amy/0000-0002-5782-7928",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; Woods Institute for the Environment; Stanford UniversityStanford University,"This work was supported by funding from the National Science Foundation, the National Geographic Society, the Woods Institute for the Environment, and Stanford University.

In the arctic tundra, numerical and functional responses of predators to preferred prey (lemmings) affect the predation pressure on alternative prey (goose eggs) and predators aggregate in areas of high alternative prey density. Therefore, we hypothesized that predation risk on incidental prey (shorebird eggs) would increase in patches of high goose nest density when lemmings were scarce. To test this hypothesis, we measured predation risk on artificial shorebird nests in quadrats varying in goose nest density on Bylot Island (Nunavut, Canada) across three summers with variable lemming abundance. Predation risk on artificial shorebird nests was positively related to goose nest density, and this relationship was strongest at low lemming abundance when predation risk increased by 600% as goose nest density increased from 0 to 12 nests ha-1. Camera monitoring showed that activity of arctic foxes, the most important predator, increased with goose nest density. Our data support our incidental prey hypothesis; when preferred prey decrease in abundance, predator mediated apparent competition via aggregative response occurs between the alternative and incidental prey items.","[McKinnon, Laura; Berteaux, Dominique; Bety, Joel] Univ Quebec, Chaire Rech Canada Conservat Ecosyst Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [McKinnon, Laura; Berteaux, Dominique; Bety, Joel] Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Gauthier, Gilles] Univ Laval, Ctr Etud Nord, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Gauthier, Gilles] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada","McKinnon, L (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Chaire Rech Canada Conservat Ecosyst Nord, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",laura.mckinnon3@gmail.com,"Berteaux, Dominique/J-3276-2016","Berteaux, Dominique/0000-0003-2728-5985; Bety, Joel/0000-0002-8775-6411",Fonds Quebecois de recherche sur la nature et les technologies (FQRNT)FQRNT; National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Environment CanadaCGIAR; W.

Our study was conducted in managed European beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest, in four closed-canopy and four shelterwood stands, during two mast and two non-mast years. We predicted that (1) forest harvest will positively affect vegetation cover, resulting in increased abundance of yellow-necked mice; (2) abundance of bank voles will not be affected by forest harvest; (3) the increased abundance of yellow-necked mice in shelterwood vs. closed-canopy stands will be more pronounced after non-mast (low rodent abundance) than after mast years (high rodent abundance), and (4) both species of rodents will select microhabitats with protective cover (provided by coarse woody debris or dense vegetation), but this preference will be stronger after non-mast than after mast years. In agreement with the first prediction, the abundance of yellow-necked mice tended to be higher in shelterwood than in closed-canopy stands, and was positively associated with average vegetation cover (generally denser in shelterwood than in closed-canopy stands). The second prediction was partially supported: while there was no clear effect of forest harvest on bank vole abundance, it was negatively affected by soil scarification conducted at two shelterwood stands. In concurrence with predictions (3) and (4), habitat associations of both rodent species were considerably weaker after mast years at both stand and microhabitat scales. Unexpectedly, after mast years, there was a negative association between bank vole abundance and vegetation cover, perhaps resulting from interference competition with yellow-necked mice. Our findings demonstrate that masting-related fluctuations in rodent abundance strongly influence their patterns of habitat selection. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Most previous studies have focused on the ecophysiology of adult algae only. We show that spores and/or germlings may represent critical stages in the life cycles and mass-developments of cooccurring opportunistic macroalgae in the Baltic (Pilayella littoralis and Enteromorpha spp.). We investigated the overwintering of spores. timing of germination, subsequent growth, and grazing on spores and germlings, in order to explain the initiation of mass blooms and species dominance patterns. In the field, Enteromorpha spp. showed 10- to 50-fold higher abundances of overwintering microscopic forms (up to 330 individuals cm(-2)) than P. littoralis. Moreover, we found continuous production of spores (up to 1.2 million settling sports m(-2) h(-1)) from April to October in Enteromorpha spp., while there was evidence of only a short reproductive period in Pilayella. However, in spring. germlings and adults of P. littoralis appeared earlier in the field and reached a 10-fold higher biomass than Enteromorpha, spp. In factorial laboratory experiments including temperature and light, there were clear differences in timing of germination. P. littoralis germinated at 5 degrees C whereas Enteromorpha spp, required temperatures of 10-15 degrees C for germination. In contrast, we detected only minor differences in growth response among adults of P, littoralis and Enteromorpha spp. Germination, not growth of adults, appeared to be the ecophysiological bottleneck for initiating mass spring development. Following the spring Pilayella bloom. Enteromorpha germlings occurred massively in the field (April-September), but rarely developed into adults. In laboratory feeding experiments we tested whether crustacean mesograzers common in summer may control development of Enteromorpha germlings. Both germination of settled spores and growth of germlings were reduced bq 93-99% in the presence of grazers (Idotea chelipes and Gammarus locusta). Thus in addition to ecophysiological constraints, grazers, if present, may play a decisive role in the early life stales of macroalgal mass developments, These results mirror patterns of overwintering of seeds, germination control, seed and seedling predation in terrestrial plant communities.","Inst Meereskunde, Abt Meeresbot, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; Zentrum Marine Tropenokol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany","Lotze, HK (corresponding author), Inst Meereskunde, Abt Meeresbot, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",hlotze@ifm.uni-kiel.de,,"Lotze, Heike/0000-0001-6258-1304; Worm, Boris/0000-0002-5742-8716",,,,47,89,103,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,1999,119,1,,,,,46,54,,10.1007/s004420050759,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,190AN,WOS:000079939500006,28308158,,,,2021-09-27,

At coastal areas where tidal cycles can restrict food access, the degree to which density of foraging birds is mediated by conspecific abundance or by the available areas is crucial to understanding patterns of bird distribution and wetland carrying capacity. We used the bathymetry of two sectors modeled with two numerical matrices to determine the availability of intertidal foraging areas in relation to tidal level (spring and neap tides), and this information was used to estimate shorebird density and foraging activity throughout the low-tide cycle in a tropical coastal lagoon in northwestern Mexico. Relative to spring tides, an 80% reduction in available foraging areas occurred during neap tides. Overall shorebird abundance was significantly reduced during neap tide periods, with differences between species. Densities of shorebirds increased during neap tides, particularly in one sector, and remained similar throughout the low-tide period (i.e. 4 h) either during spring or neap tides. Time spent foraging was consistently lower during neap-tides relative to spring-tides, especially for Long-billed curlew (44% reduction), Willet (37% reduction) and Black-necked stilt (29% reduction). These decreases in foraging activity when available habitats became reduced can hamper the opportunities of migratory shorebirds to reach their daily energy requirements to survive during the non-breeding season. This study shows that when intertidal habitats are severely reduced an important fraction of shorebird populations would probably be forced to find alternative areas to forage or increase foraging time during the night. Serving an essential function as top-predators, these results can have important implications on carrying capacity assessment for shorebirds at coastal wetlands. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In 2014, recruitment of the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides was measured at high elevations in wave-exposed intertidal habitats on the NW Atlantic coast in Nova Scotia, Canada. Values were considerably lower than previously reported for middle elevations in wave-exposed intertidal habitats on the NE Atlantic and NE Pacific coasts. To determine if such differences in recruitment may have resulted from elevation influences, I did a field experiment in 2019 in wave-exposed intertidal habitats in Nova Scotia to test the hypothesis that recruitment is higher at middle than at high elevations, based on known environmental differences between both elevation zones. Based on data from 3 locations spanning 158 km of the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, barnacle recruitment was, on average, nearly 200% higher (and recruits were larger) at middle than at high elevations. However, even with this increase, barnacle recruitment on this NW Atlantic coast is still lower than for comparable habitats on the NE Atlantic and NE Pacific coasts, and also lower than previously reported for wave-exposed locations farther south on the NW Atlantic coast, in Maine, USA. Therefore, barnacle recruitment in wave-exposed intertidal habitats on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia is moderate relative to other shores. This difference in the supply of barnacle recruits might influence the intensity of interspecific interactions involving barnacles.","[Scrosati, Ricardo A.] St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, 2320 Notre Dame Ave, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada","Scrosati, RA (corresponding author), St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, 2320 Notre Dame Ave, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada.",rscrosat@stfx.ca,"Scrosati, Ricardo A/K-6172-2016","Scrosati, Ricardo A/0000-0002-3050-132X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"I am grateful to Matthew J.

In Argentina, it has been classified as 'Endangered.' Therefore, it is necessary to obtain baseline information about its population status in order to develop adequate conservation and management measures. The aim of this study was to determine the Torrent Duck population trend in Nahuel Huapi National Park (northwest Argentine Patagonia). From 2006 to 2011, we conducted at least twice per year, surveys in 38 sections of rivers and streams with potential suitable habitat for Torrent Duck (i.e., potential suitable sites). Of those sites, 17 were previously known (i.e., historical sites). At each visit, we recorded the species' presence through direct observations or recognition of their feces, number of individuals, sex, and evidence of breeding activity. Each site (section of river with rapids) was classified as abandoned or occupied. In the latter case, a distinction was made between transient sites (i.e., occasional presence) and breeding territories (successful or unsuccessful). A reduction in the percentages of successful breeding territories was observed from 2006 (35%) to 2011 (6.5%) and an increase of the percentages of territories abandoned (10% to 19.4%, respectively), and transient sites (25% to 32.3%). Given this information, a negative population trend can be assumed for the species in this area. We suggest as possible causes of this decrease, aquatic recreational activities and competition or predation by introduced species.

Similarities and differences in assemblage composition have been driven by large-scale events, such as the trans-Arctic interchange, which has shaped the species pool, and cycles of glaciation, which have determined phases of local or regional extinction and colonization. More recently, anthropogenically induced invasions and local extinctions have significantly altered biogeographic distributions. Here we consider for both hard and soft substrata how the presence or absence of key taxa influences the outcomes of trophic and other biological interactions, and evaluate the consequences for community structure and ecosystem functioning. On intertidal hard substratum shores, biodiversity of epilithic microphagous grazers differs across latitudinal and longitudinal scales. Diversity is high in southern Europe but declines to the north and across the Atlantic. Lower diversity and the absence of patellid limpets in Iceland and the northwest Atlantic compared to Europe result in differences in consumer pressure, and an apparent contrast in the importance of herbivory vs. competitive interactions and predation pressure as community structuring processes. Interestingly, despite differences in process,'' community patterns are remarkably similar between the east and west. On soft sediment shores, there are conspicuous geographic differences in importance of bioturbators and large digging predators. Hemichordates can be abundant and important infaunal bioturbators in the western Atlantic, but they generally play a much reduced role in the eastern Atlantic. In addition, the number and diversity of digging predators on western Atlantic shores is high; the horseshoe crab, swimming portunid crabs, large whelks, excavating waterfowl, and an abundance of skates and rays exert intense predation pressure and associated biogenic disturbance to sediments. In Europe, except for excavating waterfowl these taxa are rare or absent. Thus, the importance of large, biological agents of disturbance is lower on European shores as a consequence of both recent anthropogenic pressure and natural processes over larger time scales. Consideration of key structuring taxa over the Atlantic shows that human-mediated transport has had considerable influence. Faunas on both sides of the Atlantic are becoming more similar to the point that some of the key differences in assemblage composition and hence community organization have blurred.

Severity of aphid infestations is determined by environmental variables, host plant phenology patterns, and the biological control exerted by their associated natural enemies. However, there is no information about the role these limiting and regulating factors play. Aphid densities, citrus phenology, and associated predators that overwinter in the crop were monitored weekly throughout two flush growth periods (February to July) in four clementine mandarin groves; relationships between these parameters and environmental variables (temperature and precipitation) were studied. Our results show exponential increase in aphid infestation levels to coincide with citrus phenological stages B3 and B4; shoots offer more space and nutritional resources for colony growth at these stages. Duration of these phenological stages, which was mediated by mean temperature, seems to importantly determine the severity of aphid infestations in the groves. Among those studied, the micro-coccinellids, mostly Scymnus species, were the only group of predators with the ability to efficiently regulate aphid populations. These natural enemies had the highest temporal and spatial demographic stability. Aphid regulation success was only achieved through early presence of natural enemies in the grove, at the aphid colonization phase. Our results suggest that conservation strategies aimed at preserving and enhancing Scymnus sp. populations may make an important contribution to the future success of the biological control of these key citrus pests.","[Raul Bouvet, Juan Pedro] INTA, EEA, Estn Yuqueri, CC 34,E3200AQK, Entre Rios, Argentina; [Raul Bouvet, Juan Pedro; Urbaneja, Alberto; Monzo, Cesar] IVIA, Ctr Protect Vegetal & Biotecnol, CV 315,Km 10,7, Valencia 746113, Spain","Monzo, C (corresponding author), IVIA, Ctr Protect Vegetal & Biotecnol, CV 315,Km 10,7, Valencia 746113, Spain.",cmonzo@ivia.es,"Monzo, C./O-5248-2019; Monzo, Cesar/L-7055-2014; URBANEJA, ALBERTO/AAW-6198-2020; Urbaneja, Alberto/C-9071-2011","Monzo, C./0000-0003-3247-7412; Monzo, Cesar/0000-0003-3247-7412; URBANEJA, ALBERTO/0000-0001-5986-3685; Urbaneja, Alberto/0000-0001-5986-3685","INTA-Argentina; Juan de la Cierva program grant from Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain; European Commission through FP7-PEOPLE-2013-IRSES project [611810]; Conselleria d'Agricultura, Pesca i Alimentacio de la Generalitat ValencianaGeneralitat Valenciana","We want to thank Jose Catalan for his technical assistance in the field.

In the present study, we describe the seasonal dynamics of a wide spectrum of insect predators among forest microhabitats. 2 We also examine the impact of weather conditions on insect predation, and predict that forest openness would influence the predation trends among forest microhabitats. 3 The design of our experiments enabled direct measurement of relative predation pressure on bait (larvae of the blowfly Calliphora vicina) pinned onto selected microhabitats (the base, trunk and leaves of trees) within a temperate floodplain forest (Czech Republic). 4 The most parsimonious generalized additive model showed significant trends in the predation rate among the forest microhabitats. The highest predation rate for bait was at the base of trees and the lowest predation rate was on leaves. 5 We also observed significant differences in the species structure of predators in various microhabitats. The most common source of predation on trunks was from birds, whereas wasps were the most common predator on leaves and ants were the most common at the base of trees.","[Sipos, Jan; Drozdova, Michaela] Palacky Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic; [Sipos, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Global Change Res Ctr, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Drozd, Pavel] Univ Ostrava, Fac Sci, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic","Sipos, J (corresponding author), Palacky Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, 17 Listopadu 12, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic.",Jsipos@seznam.cz,"Sipos, Jan/M-8984-2018; Sipos, Jan/H-2514-2014; Drozd, Pavel/J-3943-2013","Sipos, Jan/0000-0001-7814-7561; Sipos, Jan/0000-0001-7814-7561; Drozd, Pavel/0000-0002-4602-8856","Internal Grant Agency of Palacky University in Olomouc [PrF_2010_021]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0073, LC06073]; Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [GACR 206/99/1112, GACR 206/07/0811]; Institute of Environmental Technologies Project [CZ.1.05/2.1.00/03.0100]","The present study was supported by Grant No. PrF_2010_021 from the Internal Grant Agency of Palacky University in Olomouc and MSMT grants CzechGlobe Reg.

Fruit set can vary due to predation on flowers, pollinator services and/or resource availability. Reproductive success, measured as the fruit set of the invasive Lantana camara and the endemic Lantana peduncularis in the cool-dry season and the warm-wet season of the Galapagos Islands, was studied. Also, autonomous self-pollination ability and seed viability were probed for both species. Furthermore, flower visitors and their activity were registered for both species during the warm-wet season. Lantana peduncularis produced fewer flowers per inflorescence, but had a higher fruit set in the cool-dry season, compared to the warm-wet season. In contrast, the fruit set in L. camara did not change seasonally. The fruit set in L. camara was higher than in L. peduncularis in the warm-wet season. Moreover, similar to 18% of the bagged flowers of the invasive Lantana produced fruits by autonomous self-pollination, while for the endemic Lantana, the rate of autonomous self-pollination was very low. More than 80% of the fruits for both species had at least one viable seed per fruit. The number of pollinators and their frequency, inflorescence-and flower-visiting rates and the duration of the visit per flower were higher in the invasive Lantana than in the endemic one. The endemic Lepidoptera Urbanus galapagensis (the main pollinator of both Lantana species) and the introduced Hymenia perspectalis were observed pollinating both Lantana species. These results indicate that the alien L. camara is more attractive to pollinators and it has reproductive advantages regarding fruit set in comparison with L. peduncularis, factors that contribute to the colonization pattern of this invasive species.","[Carrion-Tacuri, Jorge; Figueroa, Enrique; Castillo, Jesus M.] Univ Seville, Dept Plant Biol & Ecol, E-41080 Seville, Spain; [Berjano, Regina] Natl Ctr Sci Res, Ctr Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Montpellier, France; [Guerrero, Giovanny] Cent Univ Ecuador, Sch Sci, Quito, Ecuador; [Tye, Alan] Secretariat Pacific Reg Environm Programme, Apia, Samoa, South Korea","Castillo, JM (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Dept Biol Vegetal & Ecol, Ap 1095, E-41080 Seville, Spain.",manucas@us.es,"Berjano, Regina/L-3975-2014; Berjano, Regina/AAC-9955-2019; Castillo, Jesus M/L-7071-2014","Berjano, Regina/0000-0001-8345-7951; Berjano, Regina/0000-0001-8345-7951; Castillo, Jesus M/0000-0003-1949-4349","Spanish Agency for International Cooperation for Development, Madrid, Spain; University of Seville, Seville, Spain","This research was supported by the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation for Development, Madrid, Spain, through a grant to the first author and by The Research Plan, University of Seville, Seville, Spain, for financial assistance to travel.

Species tolerant to extremely harsh abiotic conditions (e.g. low pH or hypoxia) often have relatively small realised niches due to a trade-off between abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, and are therefore particularly vulnerable to extinction. We hypothesised that tolerance to multiple extreme conditions (e.g. low pH, hypoxia and drought) in brown mudfish Neochanna apoda, would increase their realised niche breadth because each extreme would provide additive refuge against a dominant species, the banded kokopu Galaxias fasciatus. Fish distributions were surveyed in 65 peat-swamp-forest streams and pools in New Zealand, which varied in dissolved oxygen, acidity and hydroperiod. Mudfish distribution was extremely patchy, and almost completely allopatric with kokopu. Allopatry was driven mainly by pool hydroperiod; mudfish occupied 88 percent of temporary pools due to their tolerance of habitat drying, whereas kokopu were absent from temporary pools. Within permanent pools, mudfish occurrence was negatively related to pool oxygen and pH, whereas kokopu occurrence was positively related to these conditions. Pool conditions were independently distributed in the landscape, suggesting that each abiotic stressor offered additive refuge for mudfish from kokopu predation/competition. Consequently, the mudfish realised niche breadth depended on the number of abiotic factors driving their allopatry with kokopu. Given the widespread negative relationships between niche breadth and species extinction probabilities, our results indicate that tolerance to multiple stressors may play an important role in insuring species persistence against the multiple drivers of global environmental change.","[White, Richard S.

Masai giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) of Tanzania live in distinct social subpopulations that overlap spatially, enabling us to simultaneously explore environmental and social factors correlated with demographic variation in a metapopulation of >1,400 adult females and calves. We considered statistically distinct communities in the social network as subpopulations and tested for variation among the 10 subpopulations in adult female survival, calf survival, and reproductive rate (calf-to-adult female ratio). We then related variation in demographic rates among subpopulations to differences in vegetation, soil type, proximity to 2 types of human settlements, local giraffe population density, and social metrics of relationship strength and exclusivity among adult females. We did not find any among-subpopulation effects on adult female survival, suggesting adult female survival is buffered against environmental heterogeneity among subpopulations. Variation in calf demographic rates among subpopulations were correlated with vegetation, soils, anthropogenic factors, and giraffe population density but not with adult female relationship metrics, despite substantial spatial overlap. Subpopulations with more dense bushlands in their ranges had lower calf survival probabilities, and those closer to human settlements had higher reproductive rates, possibly because of spatial gradients in natural predation. Reproductive rates were higher in subpopulations with more volcanic soils, and calf survival probabilities were greater in subpopulations with higher local adult female densities, possibly related to higher-quality habitat associated with fertile soils or lower predation risk, or to greater competitive ability. The variation in fitness among subpopulations suggests that giraffes do not move unhindered among resource patches to equalize reproductive success, as expected according to an ideal free distribution. The differences in calf survival and reproductive rates could rather indicate intercommunity differences in competitive ability, perception, learning, or experience. Our approach of comparing demography among spatially overlapping yet distinct socially defined subpopulations provides a biologically meaningful way to quantify environmental and social factors influencing fine-scale demographic variation for social species.

The density of adult crabs showed a patchy distribution related to the sediment thickness (depth at which a layer of fossil shells are buried), but the density of juvenile crabs was not coupled with the density of adult crabs. In a field experiment, fossil shells were removed and the density of crabs significantly increased, which demonstrates that the presence of the layer of shells is a structure that may hinder the establishment of burrows. The density of crabs was related to sediment thickness, sediment torque and organic matter content. The importance of each of these variables was different for adult and juvenile crabs, indicating that the distribution of adult crabs may be caused by mechanisms affecting adult crabs themselves and is not established by the recruitment pattern. Moreover, in a field experiment, the density of juveniles decreased when adult crabs were added, and increased when adult crabs were removed. The morphology of burrows was related to sediment characteristics. Burrows were deeper, longer and more voluminous when sediment thickness was high. The volume of burrows decreased with increasing sediment torque. These results suggest that the morphology of burrows is related to the space available and the ease with which sediment it can be excavated. However, an important amount of variability remained unexplained, suggesting the presence of additional environmental variables or behavioural plasticity not considered by this study. Together, these results demonstrate that the spatial heterogeneity in the environmental factors can be translated to a spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of fiddler crabs.

Twaite shad yolk-sac larvae were collected indiscriminately at various times of day while larvae were more common during daylight hours in comparison to samples collected during the night, independently of tide. Moreover, A. f. fallax eggs, embryos and larvae were found in samples from late-March to mid-June. Peak densities were observed around late-April for eggs, mid-May for embryos and mid to late-May for larvae.

According to the optimal foraging theory, we speculated that Daphnia would graze more exposed and relatively large Clamydomonas rather than Chlorella, and this process would lead to small-sized Chlorella becoming a superior competitor in the presence of Daphnia. We used Daphnia magna, Clamydomonas sajao and Chlorella pyrenoidosa to test this hypothesis. Our grazing experiments showed that Daphnia preferred C. sajao to C. pyrenoidosa, regardless of the concentration and relative abundance of these two algae. The decrease in relative abundance of high-quality Clamydomonas in Clamydomonas-Chlorella assemblages did not diminish the grazing efficiency of Daphnia on this algal species, but increased selectivity of low-quality Chlorella. However, when the concentration of Clamydomonas was extremely high, the grazing of Daphnia on Clamydomonas decreased. In competition experiments, we observed that the presence of Clamydomonas restrained the growth potential of Chlorella; however, the introduction of herbivorous Daphnia into the competing environment weakened this influence and to some extent enhanced the growth ability of Chlorella. Moreover, we also observed that the intensity of herbivory, imposed by different densities of Daphnia, had an obvious influence on the competition outcome between Clamydomonas and Chlorella. At the highest intensity of herbivory (10 Daphnia), C. sajao was eliminated from the culture medium whereas C. pyrenoidosa could persist, but at low cell density.","[Yin, Xu Wang; Liu, Peng Fei; Zhu, Sha Sha; Chen, Xiao Xia] Dalian Ocean Univ, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Liaoning Prov Key Lab Hydrobiol, Dalian 116023, Peoples R China","Yin, XW (corresponding author), Dalian Ocean Univ, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Liaoning Prov Key Lab Hydrobiol, Dalian 116023, Peoples R China.",yinxuwang@dlou.edu.cn,,,Momentous Foundation of Contamination Control and Improvement of China [2008ZX07526-001]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31000218]; Science and Technology Foundation of Education Department of Liaoning Province [2009A176]; Liaoning Provincial Natural Science Foundation [20091018],"We thank two anonymous referees for valuable and constructive comments on the manuscript.

Visit synchrony may reduce nest predation rate or sibling competition, or instead follow from synchronisation of other behaviours, such as foraging. However, nest visit synchrony has rarely been considered in species with bi-parental care, even though it could conceivably bring similar fitness benefits to that seen in cooperative breeders. In addition, in species with bi-parental care, we might expect nest visit synchrony to reflect the quality of the pair or the overall coordination of breeding activity between partners. Here, we tested whether nest visit synchrony occurs in a classic avian model for the study of bi-parental care, the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata. We found that in the wild, both zebra finch parents visited the nest very infrequently during nestling provisioning, with only one visit per hour, and that nest visits were highly synchronised with parents visiting the nest together on 78% of the visits. In addition, we found that nest visit synchrony was correlated with hatching rate, brood size at hatching and the number of offspring in the nest a few days prior to fledging. Our results suggest that, while more work is required to understand the benefits of nest visit synchrony in this species, considering behavioural synchrony and cooperation between mated partners may offer new insight into the study of parental investment, including in species with bi-parental care.","[Mariette, Mylene M.; Griffith, Simon C.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Mariette, Mylene M.; Griffith, Simon C.] Univ New S Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Mariette, MM (corresponding author), Univ St Etienne, ENES CNPS, CNRS, UMR 8195, FR-42023 St Etienne, France.",mylene.mariette@univ-st-etienne.fr,"Griffith, Simon/A-1996-2010; Griffith, Simon/AAH-3706-2021","Griffith, Simon/0000-0001-7612-4999; Griffith, Simon/0000-0001-7612-4999; Mariette, Mylene/0000-0003-0567-4111","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0558434, DP0881019]; Macquarie Univ.; Fyssen","We are very grateful to Mike Magrath and Sarah Pryke for technical assistance with the Trovan system, to James Brazill-Boast, Gareth Davies, Jessica Haquet, Richard Merrill, Emma Pariser, Sarah Pryke, Ian Stewart, Harriet Stone, Nina Svedin and Megan Taylor for assistance in the field, Kris French and especially Ruedi Nager for useful comments.

Most studies that have examined the effect of season on the diel activity patterns of small mammals have been conducted in temperate climates where daily temperatures and day length are important predictors of activity. Extremely seasonal rainfall in northern Australia possibly exerts a strong influence on mammalian activity due to the influx of food resources. Using camera traps set over a 3-year period, we documented the diel activity patterns of 5 species of small mammals co-occurring on Groote Eylandt, in the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia. All species were strictly nocturnal but some responded differently to the effect of season. The northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) displayed a bimodal activity pattern that did not differ between the seasons. The northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus) displayed bimodal activity in the wet season and unimodal activity in the dry. The more sustained activity of I. macrourus in the dry season may be the result of this species utilizing more cellulose-rich food in times of lower insect abundance, whereas D. hallucatus possibly exhibits lower dietary plasticity. The northern hopping-mouse (Notomys aquilo) was consistently active throughout the night in both seasons. Conversely, the delicate mouse (Pseudomys delicatulus) showed great plasticity in its nocturnal activity which altered significantly depending on both season and habitat. The disparity in activity pattern between these 2 rodents possibly reflects differences in predation risks. The grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni) was recorded only during the dry season in coastal grassland habitat, when its activity peaked sharply after nightfall. Our study highlights the interspecific variation in small mammal activity between the wet and dry seasons in northern Australia, which may be explained by differences in diet, habitat use, and predation risk in these species.","[Diete, Rebecca L.; Lisle, Allan; Leung, Luke K. -P.] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia; [Meek, Paul D.] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Invas Plant & Anim Unit, Biosecur NSW, POB 530, Coffs Harbour, NSW 2450, Australia; [Meek, Paul D.] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Vertebrate Pest Res Unit, POB 530, Coffs Harbour, NSW 2450, Australia; [Dickman, Christopher R.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Diete, RL (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia.",r.diete@uq.edu.au,,"Leung, Luke/0000-0002-8829-4925",Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government; BHP Billiton,"The authors thank and acknowledge the traditional owners of Groote Eylandt for allowing access to their land for this study.

Though pesticides have been widely used to mitigate the initial S. frugiperda attack, biological control is receiving ample attention as a desirable, environmentally-sound alternative to chemical control. Hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) are abundant natural enemies in Chinese maize fields and have been observed to consume S. frugiperda larvae. In this study, we use laboratory assays to study the two-way interaction between immature stages of S. frugiperda and the endemic syrphid Eupeodes corollae. To mimic natural conditions, assays were performed in the presence of fresh maize leaves. Those 2nd or 3rd instar larvae of E. corollae preyed on 1st and 2nd instar S. frugiperda larvae with a Holling type III response, consuming a respective theoretical maximum of 43.48 and 83.33 larvae over a 24-h period. Conversely, once S. frugiperda larvae reached 3rd instar, they exhibited aggressive behavior and equally preyed on syrphid larvae with a Holling type Ill response. Those 5th and 6th instar larvae of S. frugiperda consumed a respective 16.39-19.23, 6.02-19.61 and 6.76-8.26 of 1st, 2nd and 3rd instar E. corollae larvae per day. Though our results await field-level validation, S. frugiperda agonistic (i.e., defensive) and consumptive behavior towards resident natural enemies such as E. corollae possibly degrades biotic resistance and raises its invasion potential. Our findings shine new light on the interaction between lepidopteran herbivores and their natural enemies, and can help advance the development of conservation biological control and other integrated pest management (IPM) strategies against S. frugiperda in China and abroad.","[Li Hui] China Agr Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Li Hui; Jiang Shan-shan; Zhang Hao-wen; Wyckhuys, Kris A.

Using long-term contemporary and palaeo-environmental field data, we show that this is precipitating a dramatic change in Canadian lakes: the replacement of previously dominant pelagic herbivores (Ca-rich Daphnia species) by Holopedium glacialis, a jelly-clad, Ca-poor competitor. In some lakes, this transformation is being facilitated by increases in macro-invertebrate predation, both from native (Chaoborus spp.) and introduced (Bythotrephes longimanus) zooplanktivores, to which Holopedium, with its jelly coat, is relatively invulnerable. Greater representation by Holopedium within cladoceran zooplankton communities will reduce nutrient transfer through food webs, given their lower phosphorus content relative to daphniids, and greater absolute abundances may pose long-term problems to water users. The dominance of jelly-clad zooplankton will likely persist while lakewater Ca levels remain low.","[Jeziorski, Adam; Korosi, Jennifer B.; Smol, John P.] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, PEARL, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Tanentzap, Andrew J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Plant Sci, Ecosyst & Global Change Grp, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England; [Yan, Norman D.; Cairns, Allegra] York Univ, Dept Biol, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Paterson, Andrew M.; Rusak, James A.; Ingram, Ron] Ontario Minist Environm & Climate Change, Dorset Environm Sci Ctr, Dorset, ON P0A 1E0, Canada; [Palmer, Michelle E.] Ontario Minist Environm & Climate Change, Environm Monitoring & Reporting Branch, Toronto, ON M9P 3V6, Canada; [Korosi, Jennifer B.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Arts, Michael T.] Ryerson Univ, Dept Chem & Biol, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada; [Keller, Wendel (Bill)] Laurentian Univ, Cooperat Freshwater Ecol Unit, Greater Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada","Smol, JP (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Dept Biol, PEARL, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",smolj@queensu.ca,"Keller, Wendel/G-1533-2012; Jeziorski, Adam/AAJ-6982-2020; Arts, Michael/H-4973-2012","Jeziorski, Adam/0000-0001-7701-7247; Arts, Michael/0000-0002-2335-4317; Rusak, James/0000-0002-4939-6478; Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change,This work was primarily supported by grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and funding from the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change.,,62,34,35,0,82,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Trophic interactions of both carnivores were examined from 2003 to 2008 inside a protected area after livestock removal. A total of 604 scats were analyzed. Native species (small cavids and cricetine rodents) were most frequently consumed (58%-100%) by both carnivores. Exotic prey were consumed more in 2003 than in other years by both carnivores. Culpeo foxes consumed a higher number of prey items and a lower mean weight of mammalian prey than pumas. Niche breadth was high for pumas in 2003 and for culpeo foxes in 2004, decreasing in subsequent years with the same tendency in both carnivores. Diet overlap was high in all years. Pumas seemed to prey on available prey items, suggesting a trend toward diet specialization in small prey in both carnivores. Native prey are the most important food items for both carnivores inside the park; these results are encouraging in terms of the resilience of at least some components of the predator-prey assemblage in the high mountains of central Argentina.","Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Catedra Estadist & Biometria, Natl Res Council,CONICET, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina","Pia, MV (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Cordoba, Fac Ciencias Exactas Fis & Nat, Catedra Estadist & Biometria, Natl Res Council,CONICET, Av Velez Sarsfield 299,X5016JJC, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina.",monicavpia@yahoo.com.ar,,,Rufford Foundation; Idea Wild; Scott Neotropical Funds; National Parks Administration of Argentina,"I am very grateful to the park rangers of Quebrada del Condorito National Park, C.

Predation and competition from introduced species and altered habitat have been implicated in their decline or extinction. Bandicoots and bilbies inhabit a broad range of habitats in Australia. Research on the distribution, morphology, gastrointestinal histology, lactation, metabolism and nutritional physiology of extant peramelid species has increased in the last few decades. This paper provides a review that encompasses recent nutritional-based research. Peramelid research is mostly limited to only three species - Isoodon macrourus, Perameles nasuta and Macrotis lagotis - which prevents effective comparisons between species. Peramelids are broadly classified as omnivores and possess relatively uncomplicated gastrointestinal tracts. The caecum is the region of greatest diversity among species. The relatively large caecum of Chaeropus ecaudatus supports the theory that this species may have been the only herbivorous peramelid. The caecum of M. lagotis is less pronounced than other species and is continuous with the proximal colon. M. lagotis also has a longer total colon length, which aids water conservation to ensure survival in an arid environment. Temperate-zone species such as I. macrourus, I. obesulus and P. nasuta are more similar to each other with respect to gastrointestinal morphology than either C. ecaudatus or M. lagotis. Additional research on the morphometrics of the gastrointestinal tracts of P. gunnii, P. bougainville, P. eremiana, M. leucura and I. auratus would enable further comparisons to determine whether differences are a result of geographic distribution, habitat preference or variation between genera and/or individual species. Currently, histological information of the gastrointestinal tract is limited to the small intestine of P. nasuta and I. macrourus. The histology of the small intestine of the weaned juvenile I. macrourus more closely resembles that of P. nasuta pouch young than P. nasuta adults. The younger bandicoots possessed villi whereas in the adult P. nasuta and I. macrourus villi were arranged in a zig-zag formation. The reason for the zig-zag formation of the villi and the function it may serve remains unclear. Detailed nutritional research on captive M. lagotis, I. mac:I-aunts and P. nasuta indicate that the two temperate-zone species I. macrourus and P. nasuta - are more similar to each other than to the arid-dwelling M. lagotis. Detailed nutritional studies are required on all species, both free-living and captive. Experimental diets do not always accurately reflect a natural diet, which means that results from captive studies may not reflect the situation for free-living animals. The hindgut of peramelids is the main region for retention of digesta, and presumably where microbial digestion occurs. However, no studies have been undertaken to examine the microflora of the gastrointestinal tract of bandicoots or the bilby. As captive husbandry is an important tool in conservation management, it should also improve their successful maintenance in captivity by the provision of diets that better meet their nutritional requirements.","[O'Hara, Patricia J.; Murray, Peter J.; Klieve, Athol V.] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia","O'Hara, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia.",patricia.ohara@uq.edu.au,"Murray, Peter J/D-3628-2013; Murray, Peter/AAO-5884-2021","Murray, Peter/0000-0003-1143-1706",,,,94,1,1,2,54,CSIRO PUBLISHING,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",0310-0049,,,AUST MAMMAL,Aust.

Medusae were collected between February and June in 1990 and 1991 from Woods Hole, Massachusetts and Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA. Tentaculate A. aurita create fluid motions during swimming which entrain prey and bring them into contact with tentacles. We suggest that this mechanism dominates prey selection by A. aurita. In this case, we predict that medusae of a specific diameter will positively select prey with escape speeds slower than the flow velocities at their bell margins. Negatively selected prey escape faster than the medusan flow velocity draws them to capture surfaces. Faster prey will be captured by larger medusae because flow field velocity is a function of bell diameter. On the basis of prey escape velocities and flow field velocities of A. aurita with diameters of 0.8 to 7.1 cm, we predict that A. aurita will select zooplankton such as barnacle nauplii and some slow swimming hydromedusae, while faster copepods will be negatively selected.",,"COSTELLO, JH (corresponding author), PROVIDENCE COLL, DEPT BIOL, PROVIDENCE, RI 02918 USA.",,,"Colin, Sean/0000-0003-4463-5588",,,,32,141,146,0,41,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Variation in seed disperser quality depends on seed-processing traits, dispersal distance, and deposition location, all of which ultimately affect plant fitness. Here, we compared these aspects of seed dispersal quality between a native and an invasive ant species, and examined how they affect competition and plant performance. Using experimental mesocosm communities, we examined how these two ant species affect the spatial pattern of recruitment and establishment for four myrmecochorous plant species, including one invasive species. We measured the locations of dispersed seedlings relative to ant nests, adult plants, and other dispersed seedlings, as well as measured the effects of location on plant performance. The invasive ant, Myrmica rubra, secondarily dispersed seeds farther from its nests, creating a less clumped pattern of seedling recruitment compared to the native ant, Aphaenogaster rudis. Plant species responded differently to dispersal. Invasive seedlings recruited farther from adult plants than native seedlings, and had higher survival the farther they were from conspecifics. In contrast, native plants had higher survival and grew taller when dispersed farther from invasive plants. We show that seed-dispersing ant partners differ in mutualist quality creating differences in dispersal distance and deposition location that affects a plant's competitive environment. Our results reveal the potential for long-term consequences on plant community structure with changing ant partner identity. We emphasize the need to examine dispersal quality in addition to quantity to uncover the importance of partner identity in structuring communities.","[Meadley-Dunphy, Shannon A.; Prior, Kirsten M.; Frederickson, Megan E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Meadley-Dunphy, Shannon A.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Dr Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Prior, Kirsten M.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, POB 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA","Meadley-Dunphy, SA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.; Meadley-Dunphy, SA (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Dr Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",shannon.meadleydunphy@mail.mcgill.ca,"Prior, Kirsten/AAI-6272-2021","Prior, Kirsten/0000-0002-9930-6370; Frederickson, Megan/0000-0002-9058-7137",NSERC Undergraduate Student Research AwardNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC Canada Graduate ScholarshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); EEB Postdoctoral Fellowship from the University of Toronto; Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation; NSERC Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We are grateful to G.

Watson (Spalding's catchfly) is a threatened wildflower that relies on insect-mediated pollination. However, its pollination ecology is not well understood, particularly in the Zumwalt Prairie of northeastern Oregon, which contains the largest known S. spaldingii population. Our objectives were to: (1) describe the principal insect visitors to S. spaldingii in the Zumwalt Prairie, (2) quantify the available pool of pollinators in the area, and (3) determine whether the visitation rate to individual plants is associated with the density of S. spaldingii at the patch scale, as predicted by the resource concentration hypothesis, and/or by the density and composition of non-S. spaldingii blooming plants, as predicted by the facilitation and competition hypotheses. We recorded insect visits to S. spaldingii during peak bloom at 30 patches and characterized the local bee community using blue vane traps. We quantified the patch-scale density of S. spaldingii and the composition and abundance of other blooming species at each patch. Two bumble bee species comprised all observed visits, although they constituted only 20% of the total bees sampled on the prairie. Bumble bees showed a high degree of host fidelity even when other blooming plants were present. Per capita visitation rates increased with catchfly density and blooming plant abundance at the patch scale, supporting the resource concentration and facilitation hypotheses. Silene spaldingii in the Zumwalt Prairie appears to rely on a narrow pool of pollinators that may preferentially visit it over other blooming plants, and more dense patches of S. spaldingii may increase pollination efficiency.","[Tubbesing, Carmen] Brown Univ, Dept Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Strohm, Christopher] Mercyhurst Coll, Dept Biol, Erie, PA 16546 USA; [DeBano, Sandra J.] Oregon State Univ, Hermiston Agr Res & Extens Ctr, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Hermiston, OR 97838 USA; [Gonzalez, Natalie] Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA; [Kimoto, Chiho] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Taylor, Robert V.] Nature Conservancy, Enterprise, OR 97828 USA","DeBano, SJ (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Hermiston Agr Res & Extens Ctr, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Hermiston, OR 97838 USA.",sandy.debano@oregonstate.edu,"Tubbesing, Carmen/AAR-4328-2021",,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0755511]; Thomas G.

Olfactory information may play a fundamental role in the assessment of predation threats, because predators produce characteristic body odours, but the role of odours in habitat selection has seldom been considered. Here, we test whether fear of predation induced by odour cues may affect the settlement pattern of a Mediterranean cavity-dependent community of rodents and non-excavator hole-nesting birds. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally manipulated the perception of predation risk on a scale of patch by applying either odours of a carnivore predator (risky odour treatment), lemon essence (non-risky odour treatment) and a control non-odorous treatment and studied bird and rodent settlement patterns. Nest-box occupation probability differed across treatments so that species in the community settled in more numbers in control than in non-risky and than in risky odour-treated nest boxes. Concerning settlement patterns, control nest boxes were occupied more rapidly than nest boxes with odour information. Birds and rodents settled earlier in control than in risky odour-treated nest boxes, but their settlement pattern did not significantly vary between risky odour and non-risky odour-treated nest boxes. Our findings demonstrate that olfactory cues may be used to assess habitat quality by settling species in this community, but we cannot pinpoint the exact mechanism that has given rise to the pattern of preference by nest boxes.","[Aviles, Jesus M.; Parejo, Deseada; Exposito-Granados, Monica] EEZA CSIC, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Parejo, Deseada] Univ Extremadura, Dept Anat Cellular Biol & Zool, Badajoz 06006, Spain","Aviles, JM (corresponding author), EEZA CSIC, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Almeria 04120, Spain.",javiles@eeza.csic.es,"Exposito-Granados, Monica/K-1863-2019","Exposito-Granados, Monica/0000-0002-7996-2469","Spanish Ministries of Education and Science/FEDER [CGL2011-27561/BOS, CGL2014-56769-P]; Government of Extremadura [TA13002]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2012-051898]","We thank Juan Rodriguez-Ruiz for help during data collection and Robert L.

Moreover, although terrestrial consumer communities often contain many consumer species, little is known about which consumers may generate apparent competition, and whether the strength or mechanism of apparent competition differs among different members of the consumer community. Using consumer-specific experimental exclosures and seed additions in the invaded grasslands of California, we demonstrate that multiple mechanisms of apparent competition are capable of limiting the re-establishment of the native grass Nassella pulchra in the absence of direct competition with exotic plants. The effect of small mammalian consumers (mice and voles) and larger consumers (e.g. rabbits, squirrels, deer) decreased with distance to the exotic forb Brassica nigra, which varied from 0-33 meters from focal N. pulchra. The effect of larger consumers also depended upon characteristics of the plant community directly adjacent (i.e. approx. 1 m) from focal N. pulchra. The effect of large consumers also increased with the richness of the exotic plant community and the degree to which the exotic plant community was dominated by exotic grasses as opposed to exotic forbs. Our finding that apparent competition can be driven by different mechanisms, that the importance of each mechanism depends upon which consumers have access, and that each mechanism has a different spatial extent, suggests that the composition of both the consumer community and the exotic plant community may shape the spatial dynamics of reestablishment, the potential for restoration, and the need for conservation.","[Orrock, John L.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Witter, Martha S.] Natl Pk Serv, Santa Monica Mt Natl Recreat Area, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 USA","Orrock, JL (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",orrock@wustl.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0444217, DEB-0072909]; Center for Invasive Plant Management; National Park Service (NPS); National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis; Univ. of California; Santa Barbara Campus","We thank Jim Reichman for many valuable discussions and insights.

This suggests the importance of extending classical population dynamics models to include such eco-evolutionary processes. Here, we describe a predator-prey model in which the prey population growth depends on a prey densitydependent fitness landscape. We show that this two-species ecosystem is capable of exhibiting chaos even in the absence of external environmental variation or noise, and that the onset of chaotic dynamics is the result of the fitness landscape reversibly alternating between epochs of stabilizing and disruptive selection. We draw an analogy between the fitness function and the free energy in statistical mechanics, allowing us to use the physical theory of first-order phase transitions to understand the onset of rapid cycling in the chaotic predator-prey dynamics. We use quantitative techniques to study the relevance of our model to observational studies of complex ecosystems, finding that the evolution-driven chaotic dynamics confer community stability at the edge of chaos while creating a wide distribution of opportunities for speciation during epochs of disruptive selection-a potential observable signature of chaotic eco-evolutionary dynamics in experimental studies.","[Gilpin, William] Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Feldman, Marcus W.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Gilpin, W (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",wgilpin@stanford.edu,,,Department of Defense (DoD) through National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG),"WG is supported by the Department of Defense (DoD) through the National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) Program (https://ndseg.asee.org/).

However, apex predators' effects on mesopredators are also likely to be modulated by interactions with human activities and ecosystem productivity. The exploitation ecosystems hypothesis (EEH) predicts that biomass of apex predators will scale with primary productivity but herbivore and mesopredator biomass will remain constant due to top-down control. Here, we take advantage of the manipulation of dingo abundance across Australia's Dingo Fence to explore the primacy of top-down and bottom-up effects as drivers of feral cat abundance. Using field data collected across the Dingo Fence, we test the predictions generated by MRH and EEH that cat populations should be bottom-up controlled by prey abundance (a proxy for primary productivity) where top-down control exerted by dingoes was weak but not where it was strong. We examined dingo and cat scats to provide mechanistic support for the idea that dingoes control cats through killing and exploitative competition. Overall, cats were more abundant where dingoes were rare. Cat abundance was correlated positively with prey abundance where dingoes were rare but was not correlated with prey abundance where dingoes were common. Cat remains were present in 1% of dingo scats, and dietary overlap between cats and dingoes was high (0.75-0.82). Our study provides evidence that top-down control exerted by apex predators can decouple population dynamics between mesopredators and their prey and thus have primacy over bottom-up effects.","[Feit, Benjamin] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, POB 7044, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Feit, Benjamin; Feit, Anna; Letnic, Mike] Univ New South Wales, Sch BEES, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Feit, B (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, POB 7044, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.; Feit, B (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch BEES, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",benjamin.feit@slu.se,,"Feit, Benjamin/0000-0002-1579-7695; Letnic, Michael/0000-0003-4191-8427",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Ogilvy family,"The Australian Research Council provided funding.

Sulfur, predatory mites, and powdery mildew have long been studied separately regarding their impacts on spider mites, but knowledge of their combined influence in that context is also needed to aid integrated pest and disease management. Therefore, we conducted controlled laboratory experiments to study the main and the interaction effects of sulfur, P. persimilis, P. aphanis, and T. urticae in strawberry leaf disc bioassays. The results showed that the predatory mite, powdery mildew, and sulfur had additive effects on reducing egg number and population growth of T. urticae. Compared to the control, populations of T. urticae on the leaf discs were decreased by 83%, 76%, and 61% after 5 days of treatment with sulfur + powdery mildew + predatory mites, mildew + predatory mites, and predatory mites alone, respectively. The survival and egg production of T. urticae females was affected to the greatest extent by P. persimilis, followed by powdery mildew. Residual sulfur had a short-term suppressive effect on T. urticae egg production but did not influence survival and reproduction of P. persimilis. If these findings also apply under field conditions, controlling powdery mildew will not reduce the need for spider mite control in strawberry, as has been suggested for other fruit crops.

Macroalgal meadows are often a prominent component of tropical marine ecosystems, yet we have little understanding of how dynamic shifts in this habitat type may affect patterns of fish biodiversity. We examined whether a tropical carnivorous wrasse, Xenojulis margaritaceus, was a macroalgal specialist that responded to changes in canopy habitat structure across space and time. Field surveys revealed that X. margaritaceus exclusively occupied macroalgal meadows, where it foraged for invertebrate epifauna on a range of macroalgal genera such as Sargassum and Lobophora. During summer, X. margaritaceus preferentially occupied the canopy-forming macroalgae Sargassum. Sargassum canopy height, percent cover of understorey algae and the abundance of strong competitors and roving predators provided the best predictors for the abundance of X. margaritaceus abundance across the seascape. Despite seasonal shifts in habitat use to include more understorey algae during winter, X. margaritaceus displayed significant declines in abundance from summer to winter according to the extent of seasonal canopy habitat loss within each meadow. We conclude that carnivorous fishes can be dependent on tropical macroalgal meadows, where they may be vulnerable to a loss of canopy habitat quality arising from local factors and climatic forcing.","[Wenger, Lucy N.; van Lier, Joshua R.; Fulton, Christopher J.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Wenger, LN (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",lucynwenger@gmail.com,,,Australian National University (ANU)Australian National University; Australian Academy of Science (Thomas Davies Research Award); Research School of Biology at ANU; Linnean Society of NSW,"We thank K.

For instance, to control thrips and fly pests, a combination of Neoseiulus cucumeris (Oudemans 1930), a foliar predatory mite, Stratiolaelaps miles (Berlese 1892), a soil dwelling mite and Dalotia coriaria (Kraatz 1856), a soil dwelling beetle, show efficacy for controlling all life-stages. However, when introduced biological control agents overlap in their distributions and diet, there is the potential for competition or intraguild predation. Frequently studies of intraguild interactions involve isolation of one pest or prey and a host of predators, here we conducted an initially open greenhouse experiment in a marigold system and allowed communities to assemble. We measured the community responses in the soil and foliar habitat strata to a fully replicated factorial design of all combinations of three common greenhouse predators, N. cucumeris, S. miles and D. coriaria. Over 288,158 arthropods were recovered from this six-week experiment resulting in unique soil and foliar communities of introduced predators, greenhouse arthropods, and pest life-stages. In the foliar habitat strata, spider mite populations rapidly overwhelmed the initial focus on thrips, indicating the importance of pest interactions for determining the efficacy of biological control. Overlap of predator populations occurred in the soil strata, which led to complex intraguild interactions. Results provide further evidence that separation of introduced predators and availability of alternative prey in greenhouse systems is important for managing potential agonistic interactions.","[Schmidt, Jason M.; Pochubay, Emily A.; Tourtois, Joseph; Grieshop, Matthew J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Schmidt, Jason M.] Univ Georgia, Dept Entomol, Tifton Campus, Tifton, GA 31793 USA","Schmidt, JM; Grieshop, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Entomol, Coastal Plain Expt Stn, 2360 Rainwater Rd, Tifton, GA 31793 USA.",jschmid2@uga.edu; grieshop@msu.edu,,,Project GREEEN at Michigan State University,"Many thanks to Krista Buehrer, Nathaniel Walton, Kristy Morrel, Michelle Brosius, and Kirk Green for their help throughout the experiment.

In the first experiment 2nd and 4th instar C. maculata were fed aphids reared for 24 h on wheat plants treated with sub-lethal thiamethoxam soil drenches to assess the effect of insecticidal dose on the predator. In the second experiment a constant, sub-lethal thiamethoxam soil drench was used on wheat plants, but the plants were infested with different densities of aphids. Aphids from each density treatment were then fed to C. maculata 2nd instars. Insecticide levels within wheat and aphid tissues were quantified using a competitive ELISA. In experiment one, 4th instars of C. maculata displayed no negative effects after consuming aphids from treated plants. However, 2nd instars of C. maculata ate more treated aphids than untreated aphids and larval development times varied between the untreated larvae and those receiving the low dose of the insecticide. In experiment two, the 2nd instar C. maculata displayed slower walking speeds after consuming aphids from low aphid density plants. Thiamethoxam within wheat tissue was found at higher levels with increasing dose. This insecticide was also found at higher levels in wheat plants with the lowest aphid density. Clothianidin, a toxic metabolite of thiamethoxam, was found in aphids that had fed on thiamethoxam-treated wheat, but no differences between treatments were observed. The neonicotinoid treatment altered the quality of R. padi as prey for 2nd instar C. maculata, but this depended on the aphid infestation level on the plants. In addition to revealing a potential deleterious effect of thiamethoxam systemic insecticides in wheat, our assays provide insight into the design and interpretation of toxicity assays involving systemic neonicotinoids and herbivores.

Competition may also alter the foraging behaviour of individuals, which can be influenced by dominance status and the way food is distributed over the environment. Many studies measuring the effects of competition and dominance status have been conducted on a uniform or highly clumped food distribution, while in reality prey distributions are often in-between these two extremes. The few studies that used a more natural food distribution only detected subtle effects of interference and dominance. We therefore conducted an experiment on a natural food distribution with focal mallards Anas platyrhynchos foraging alone and in a group of three, having a dominant, intermediate or subordinate dominance status. In this way, the foraging behaviour of the same individual in different treatments could be compared, and the effect of dominance was tested independently of individual identity. The experiment was balanced using a 4 x 4 Latin square design, with four focal and six non-focal birds. Individuals in a group achieved a similar intake rate (i.e. number of consumed seeds divided by trial length) as when foraging alone, because of an increase in the proportion of time feeding (albeit not significant for subordinate birds). Patch residence time and the number of different patches visited did not differ when birds were foraging alone or in a group. Besides some agonistic interactions, no differences in foraging behaviour between dominant, intermediate and subordinate birds were measured in group trials. Possibly group-foraging birds increased their feeding time because there was less need for vigilance or because they increased foraging intensity to compensate for competition. This study underlines that a higher competitor density does not necessarily lead to a lower intake rate, irrespective of dominance status.","[van Dijk, Jacintha G.

Shadow competition, wherein a predator 'upstream' restricts access to prey for another individual further 'downstream', can affect the foraging success of stationary predators. However, in spiders that build orb-webs in proximity to each other, insect prey often 'ricochet' off the outer web and land on the inner web. In this study, I asked whether the negative effect of shadow competition could be compensated for by the ricochet effect. I experimentally show that despite a strong spatial advantage to a spider on the outer side in terms of prey interceptions, the likelihood of prey intercepting the inner web is increased through the ricochet effect. I also show that the degree of overlap between the webs significantly influences both the number of prey intercepted as well as the number of ricochets. This study shows experimentally that a spider that builds its web close to a conspecific's web suffers very little cost in terms of lost prey interception.","Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia","Rao, D (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",dinrao@gmail.com,"Rao, Dinesh/A-2097-2008","Rao, Dinesh/0000-0002-1900-7742",Macquarie University,"I thank Marie Herberstein for her guidance, patience and support during this project.

Recent experimental research has shown that parasitized hosts can continue to interact with their unparasitized counterparts through competition. Parasitoid phenology, in particular the timing of emergence from the host, determines the duration of this competition. We construct a discrete-time host-parasitoid model in which within-generation dynamics associated with parasitoid timing is explicitly incorporated. We found that late-emerging parasitoids induce less severe, but more frequent, host outbreaks, independent of the choice of competition model. The competition experienced by the parasitized host reduces the parasitoids' numerical response to changes in host numbers, preventing the 'boom-bust' dynamics associated with more efficient parasitoids. We tested our findings against experimental data for the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hubner) system, where a large number of consecutive years at a high host density is synonymous with severe forest damage.

Since meso-predators themselves are also prospective prey, they too need to trade-off between food and safety. We applied foraging theory to study patch use and habitat selection by a meso-predator, the red fox. We present evidence that foxes use a quitting harvest rate rule when deciding whether or not to abandon a foraging patch, and experience diminishing returns when foraging from a depletable food patch. Furthermore, our data suggest that patch use decisions of red foxes are influenced not just by the availability of food, but also by their perceived risk of predation. Fox behavior was affected by moonlight, with foxes depleting food resources more thoroughly (lower giving-up density) on darker nights compared to moonlit nights. Foxes reduced risk from hyenas by being more active where and when hyena activity was low. While hyenas were least active during moon, and most active during full moon nights, the reverse was true for foxes. Foxes showed twice as much activity during new moon compared to full moon nights, suggesting different costs of predation. Interestingly, resources in patches with cues of another predator (scat of wolf) were depleted to significantly lower levels compared to patches without. Our results emphasize the need for considering risk of predation for intermediate predators, and also shows how patch use theory and experimental food patches can be used for a predator. Taken together, these results may help us better understand trophic interactions.","[Mukherjee, Shomen; Zelcer, Michal; Kotler, Burt P.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel","Mukherjee, S (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel.",shomen@bgu.ac.il,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",,,,37,45,45,3,70,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2009,159,3,,,,,661,668,,10.1007/s00442-008-1243-3,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,408ER,WOS:000263418800018,19082629,,,,2021-09-27,

One important issue in this context is how size variation within cohorts may develop over time. Here, we tested the hypothesis, in gape-limited animals such as fish, that size divergence among individuals within a cohort depends on the opportunity to undergo size-dependent diet shifts, by allowing initially larger individuals to make an early diet shift when the first resource becomes limiting. We used young-of-the-year perch (Perca fluviatilis) as our study organism. Competitive intensity and the opportunity to undergo a diet shift from zooplankton to macroinvertebrates affected both mean growth rates and the extent to which inter-individual variation in growth was manifested. As predicted, increased competition combined with the presence of both zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates increased the degree of size variation. However, size divergence was also observed among individuals when only the initial resource, zooplankton, was available. We argue that only non-exploitative interactions, such as dominance structures and social interactions, could have caused this latter pattern, as exploitative competition is expected to lead to size convergence due to the superior competitive ability of smaller individuals. Our results suggest that diet shifts are not a prerequisite for size divergence in animal cohorts, and that dominance and social interactions may have similar effects on size variation within cohorts. Finally, development of size variation is suggested to have strong implications for overall cohort performance.","[Huss, Magnus; Bystrom, Par; Persson, Lennart] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Huss, M (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",magnus.huss@emg.umu.se,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012",,Swedish Council for Forestry and Agricultural SciencesSwedish Research Council Formas,We thank Emma Gothe and Marten Soderquist for Weld and laboratory assistance.

While overall density was elevated in both high augmentation creeks, hatchery-reared snook in one creek experienced a 64-85% loss within 1 month after release; loss of hatchery-reared or wild snook was negligible in other experimental creeks.

The ability to control the densities of focal organisms makes these structures a powerful tool. However, cages can often produce artifacts that influence the outcome of experiments. Although a subset of these artifacts have been examined previously, the effects of cages on water motion have not been adequately addressed from a quantitative standpoint, especially in high-flow environments. We targeted this data gap by explicitly measuring the fractional degree of velocity reduction inside a variety of experimental cage structures across flow conditions spanning those typical of wave-swept shallow subtidal and intertidal zones. Cages decreased velocities inside by up to 47% and reduced high-energy impact forces by more than 40%. Associated cage controls, employed to mimic physical effects of cages without interfering with organism movement, often had effects on water flow similar to those of cages. However, the nearly half an order of magnitude change in velocities inside cages and their controls reveals the need to be vigilant in considering potential artifacts, especially those tied to secondary biological interactions. These artifacts may be reduced by maximizing mesh size, employing large plot sizes and low profile structures, using cage controls that best mimic effects of the full cage, and monitoring cage controls to avoid the establishment of high-density consumer hotels within them. Using such approaches, researchers can minimize experimental biases and simplify the explanation of experimental results.

For juvenile spiders habitat complexity reduced predation by adult females, whereas cannibalism among second instar spiderlings was not affected by habitat structure suggesting that complex habitat structure only provides shelter from cannibalism by large conspecifics. High density of juvenile spiders increased cannibalism only when alternative prey was available, suggesting that alternative prey increased aggression and interference at higher density. High mortality and tow growth of spiders in treatments without alternative prey likely resulted from starvation indicating that intraspecific prey is of low food quality and does not allow spider development.

When compared with a study of 1968: the density of the extant population at a 43-ha study site was 0.36/ha, as opposed to 2.03/ha. Leaves represented only 38% of dietary volume, in contrast to 71% in 1968. Fruit comprised 56% of the diet. Well fed individuals of C. pinguis from a relocated population on Guana Island would not eat the leafy components of the Anegada iguanas' diet. Home ranges on Anegada overlapped and were 100 times larger than previously recorded. The sex ratio was two males to one female as opposed to 1:1 in 1968. Iguanas had proportionately lower body mass than animals captured in 1968. population decline on Anegada seems largely due to increased competition from live stock, managed in 1968 but now feral, eating most palatable vegetation from the understory. Predation by cats and dogs is also a threat. The total remaining population is estimated at <200 individuals. A national park designed to protect the endangered population of C. pinguis has been proposed for Anegada.","Conservat Agcy Branch Off, Jamestown, RI 02835 USA","Mitchell, NC (corresponding author), Conservat Agcy Branch Off, 67 Howland Ave, Jamestown, RI 02835 USA.",,,,,,,17,23,27,0,13,HERPETOLOGISTS LEAGUE,EMPORIA,"EMPORIA STATE UNIV, DIVISION BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 1200 COMMERCIAL ST, EMPORIA, KS 66801-5087 USA",0018-0831,1938-5099,,HERPETOLOGICA,Herpetologica,MAR,1999,55,1,,,,,7,17,,,,,11,Zoology,Zoology,272BD,WOS:000084629900002,,,,,2021-09-27,

Fruit set is low on the apex of inflorescences, and most inflorescences with small supporting stems do not produce fruit. Resource limitation was examined as a possible determinant of this fruiting pattern. All flowers had two apparently functional ovules, indicating that B. spinulosa is not andromonoecious. Ovules from the apical third of inflorescences were smaller than ovules from the mid and basal thirds of inflorescences. Also, ovule size decreased with decreasing stem diameter of inflorescences. However, small ovules were fertile. Experimental removal of flowers from the basal one-third and two-thirds of inflorescences increased fruit set of apical flowers by 71% and 152%, respectively. Similarly, fruit set of inflorescences with small stems increased twofold when inflorescences with large stems were prevented from producing fruit. These results indicate that resources can be reallocated both within and among inflorescences and that fruiting patterns are primarily a consequence of interovary competition occurring at both these levels. Anatomical constraints may also be important because the increases in fruit set in the experimental treatments did not completely compensate for the flowers and inflorescences that were removed. Low fruit: flower ratios in B. spinulosa may allow plants to increase reproductive output when nutrients are abundant and to compensate for the effects of floral predators.","UNIV NEW ENGLAND,DEPT ZOOL,ARMIDALE,NSW 2351,AUSTRALIA",,,,,,,,32,52,60,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 S WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637",1058-5893,,,INT J PLANT SCI,Int.

The study was carried out on a rocky hillslope in the Central Negev Desert, Israel. Rodent predation on snails is limited by the number of shelters for rodents in the area. In most natural conditions, more shelters are found on the upper than on the lower slope. We introduced artificial shelters along the slope. We then censused the number of rodents, snails, and of eaten snails for five years. In the presence of artificial shelters the predation efficiency of rodents (number of snail eaten per rodent) increased. The number of rodents also increased and the number of snails decreased on the experimental plots relative to control plots. We suggest that the persistence of the snail-rodent system is due to spatial variation in the relative importance of direct prey-predator relations and the indirect effects of snail immigration to the slope and presence of protective shelters for the rodents. Our study supports recent work indicating that in a prey-predator system, in addition to direct predation, the heterogeneity of the environment and predation risk while foraging, affect both the behavior and the density of the predator and the prey.","BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,JACOB BLAUSTEIN INST DESERT RES,MITRANI CTR DESERT ECOL,IL-84120 BEER SHEVA,ISRAEL","ABRAMSKY, Z (corresponding author), BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,JACOB BLAUSTEIN INST DESERT RES,DEPT BIOL,IL-84120 BEER SHEVA,ISRAEL.",,"ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012",,,,,30,13,13,0,4,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1992,65,1,,,,,128,133,,10.2307/3544895,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JH676,WOS:A1992JH67600015,,,,,2021-09-27,

Agardh (Rhodophyta) and other benthic organisms including the alcyonacean soft coral Sinularia cruciata (Tixier-Durivault) were investigated on an inshore fringing reef environment in which P. hamatum was the dominant large fleshly alga. Field observations of sessile reef organisms including octocorals and sponges living in close proximity to P. hamatum revealed that varying degrees of tissue necrosis were suffered by the invertebrates when in physical contact with the alga. In order to establish whether the chemical constituents of the alga, especially chloromertensene, played a role in this necrosis, manipulative field experiments were carried out in the Pelorus Channel, Palm Island group (18-degrees-34'S; 146-degrees-29'E), North Queensland, Australia, in November and December 1988. The first experiment involved the relocation of healthy plants and soft corals into contact and non-contact situations on a mesh grid. In all cases of contact between P. hamatum and S. cruciata, the soft coral suffered tissue necrosis (n = 6, p = 0.0022). The second experiment had the same design, but involved the use of artificial plants both uncoated and coated with natural levels of chloromertensene, in contact with S. cruciata. In all cases of contact with coated treatments, necrosis was observed in S. cruciata (n = 4, p = 0.025). In cases where uncoated artificial fronds were placed in contact with soft corals, S. cruciata showed minor abrasion effects, but no appreciable necrosis. Coated treatments were not fouled by epiphytes during the experiment and were not consumed by predators. Uncoated treatments were rapidly reduced in size by predation and any remaining material was biofouled. These experiments thus demonstrated that the deleterious effects observed in soft corals in the field were caused by contact with the alga P. hamatum, that these effects were indeed chemically mediated by chloromertensene, and that physical contact without chemical intervention caused no such deleterious effects. This is the first experimental evidence which conclusively demonstrates allelopathy between an alga and other marine organisms and identifies the compound responsible for the observed allelopathic effects.","JAMES COOK UNIV N QUEENSLAND,DEPT CHEM & BIOCHEM,TOWNSVILLE,QLD 4811,AUSTRALIA; JAMES COOK UNIV N QUEENSLAND,DEPT BOT,TOWNSVILLE,QLD 4811,AUSTRALIA",,,"de Nys, Rocky/D-6741-2012","de Nys, Rocky/0000-0003-3869-4928",,,,60,76,83,0,14,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

As a first step toward understanding the potential effects of spongivores on sponge diversity and abundance, we identified sponge predators at nine sites in Wakatobi Marine National Park, Indonesia, and conducted a short-term caging experiment to examine the effects of excluding predators on noncryptic reef sponges at this location. Nudibranchs were the most abundant invertebrate spongivores, although their low densities are likely to limit their influence on sponges. Fish were the most abundant vertebrate spongivores with 16 species from six families observed feeding on sponges. Based on their abundance and our feeding observations, the fish with the greatest potential to influence sponge assemblages in Wakatobi Marine National Park were Zanclus cornutus, Chaetodon Pygoplites diacanthus, and Pontacanthus sexstriatus. We did not detect an effect of excluding spongivores on noncryptic reef sponge abundance in our caging experiment, which may be due to these species having evolved chemical defenses against predators.

Knowledge about this population is limited, and currently there is no information about dietary needs and threats posed by fisheries. We studied the diet composition of Shags in the Berlengas archipelago, the largest breeding colony in the country, through the analysis of 124 regurgitated pellets, and estimated trophic overlap with local fisheries, during the breeding and winter seasons of 2016-2017. A total of 32 fish species were identified in their diet, while their major prey consisted of sand eels (Ammodytidae) and species from the Labridae, Gadidae and Sparidae families. Diet composition varied seasonally and was more specialized during the breeding season, with sand eels comprising 70% of all prey consumed and 45% of total biomass. During winter, the consumption of heavier predatory fish increased, particularly fish from the Gadidae and Sparidae families. Shags consumed 17 species also targeted by commercial fisheries, and fish were in the same size range, highlighting the potential for resource competition. Fish species that contributed the most to prey overlap were the Pouting Trisopterus luscus, White Seabream Diplodus sargus, Common Two-banded Seabream Diplodus vulgaris, Bogue Boops boops and Black Seabream Spondyliosoma cantharus. Among different types of fishery, trophic overlap with Shags was more pronounced with polyvalent gear (longlines and gillnets), especially during winter, than with purse seine and trawling. Competition between Shags and local commercial fisheries may represent an additional pressure on foraging Shags, as well as increasing their conflict with fishing activity.","[Nascimento, Tania; Luis, Antonio] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Nascimento, Tania; Oliveira, Nuno] Soc Portuguesa Estudo Aves, Av Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro 87,3, P-1070062 Lisbon, Portugal","Nascimento, T (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.; Nascimento, T (corresponding author), Soc Portuguesa Estudo Aves, Av Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro 87,3, P-1070062 Lisbon, Portugal.",taniaslnascimento@gmail.com,,,project Life Berlengas [LIFE13/NAT/PT/000458]; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre; Portuguese Government through 'Fundo Ambiental',"We are grateful to Isabel Fagundes, Joana Bores and all the volunteers for their help during field work in the Berlengas Archipelago.

The interest has expanded to include ecologically significant groups and major biomass producers using mesocosm studies, emphasizing species interactions. This paper assesses the effects of UV-B radiation on dissolved organic matter, decomposers, primary and secondary producers, and briefly summarizes recent studies in freshwater and marine systems. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) are degradation products of living organisms. These substances are of importance in the cycling of carbon in aquatic ecosystems. UV-B radiation has been found to break down high-molecular-weight substances and make them available to bacterial degradation. In addition, DOC is responsible for short-wavelength absorption in the water column. Especially in coastal areas and freshwater ecosystems, penetration of solar radiation is limited by high concentrations of dissolved and particulate matter. On the other hand, climate warming and acidification result in faster degradation of these substances and thus enhance the penetration of UV radiation into the water column. Several research groups have investigated light penetration into the water column. Past studies on UV penetration into the water column were based on temporally and spatially scattered measurements. The process of spectral attenuation of radiant energy in natural waters is well understood and straightforward to model. Less known is the spatial and temporal variability of in-water optical properties influencing UV attenuation and there are few long-term observations. In Europe, this deficiency of measurements is being corrected by a project involving the development of a monitoring system (ELDONET) for solar radiation using three-channel dosimeters (UV-A, W-B, PAR) that are being installed from Abisko (North Sweden, 68 degrees N, 19 degrees E) to Tenerife (Canary Islands, 27 degrees N, 17 degrees W). Some of the instruments have been installed in the water column (North Sea, Baltic Sea, Kattegat, East and Western Mediterranean, North Atlantic), establishing the first network of underwater dosimeters for continuous monitoring. Bacteria play a vital role in mineralization of organic matter and provide a trophic Link to higher organisms. New techniques have substantially changed our perception of the role of bacteria in aquatic ecosystems over the recent past and bacterioplankton productivity is far greater than previously thought, having high division and turnover rates. It has been shown that bacterioplankton play a central role in the carbon flux in aquatic ecosystems by taking up DOC and remineralizing the carbon. Bacterioplankton are more prone to W-B stress than larger eukaryotic organisms and, based on one study, produce about double the amount of cyclobutane dimers. Recently, the mechanism of nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria has been shown to be affected by UV-B stress. Wetlands constitute important ecosystems both in the tropics and at temperate latitudes. In these areas, cyanobacteria form major constituents in microbial mats. The organisms optimize their position in the community by vertical migration in the mat, which is controlled by both visible and W-B radiation. Cyanobacteria are also important in tropical and sub-tropical rice paddy fields, where they contribute significantly to the availability of nitrogen. Solar UV radiation affects growth, development and several physiological responses of these organisms. On a global basis, phytoplankton are the most important biomass producers in aquatic ecosystems. The organisms populate the top layers of the oceans and freshwater habitats where they receive sufficient solar radiation for photosynthetic processes. New research strengthens previous evidence that solar UV affects growth and reproduction, photosynthetic energy-harvesting enzymes and other cellular proteins, as well as photosynthetic pigment contents. The uptake of ammonium and nitrate is affected by solar radiation in phytoplankton, as well as in macroalgae. Damage to phytoplankton at the molecular, cellular, population and community levels has been demonstrated. In contrast, at the ecosystem level there are few convincing data with respect to the effects of ozone-related W-B increases and considerable uncertainty remains. Following UV-B irradiation, shifts in phytoplankton community structure have been demonstrated, which may have consequences for the food web. Macroalgae and seagrasses are important biomass producers in aquatic ecosystems (but considerably smaller than phytoplankton). In contrast to phytoplankton, most of these organisms are sessile and can thus not avoid exposure to solar radiation at their growth site. Recent investigations showed a pronounced sensitivity to solar W-B radiation, and effects have been found throughout the top 10-15 m of the water column. Photoinhibition can be quantified by oxygen exchange or by PAM (pulse amplitude modulated) fluorescence. Surface-adapted macroalgae, such as several brown and green algae, show a maximum of oxygen production at or close to the surface; whereas algae adapted to lower irradiances usually thrive best when exposed deeper in the water column. Mechanisms of protection and repair are being investigated. UV effects on aquatic animals are of increased interest. Evidence for UV effects has been demonstrated in zooplankton activity. Other UVB-sensitive aquatic organisms include sea urchins, corals and amphibians. Solar UV radiation has been known to affect corals directly. In addition, photosynthesis in their symbiotic algae is impaired, resulting in reduced organic carbon supply. Amphibian populations are in serious decline in many areas of the world, and scientists are seeking explanations for this phenomenon. Most amphibian population declines are probably due to habitat destruction or habitat alteration. Some declines are probably the result of natural population fluctuations. Other explanations for the population declines and reductions in range include disease, pollution, atmospheric changes and introduced competitors and predators. W-B radiation is one agent that may act in conjunction with other stresses to affect amphibian populations adversely. The succession of algal communities is controlled by a complex array of external conditions, stress factors and interspecies influences. Freshwater ecosystems have a high turnover and the success of an individual species is difficult to predict, but the development of general patterns of community structure follows defined routes. There is a strong predictive relationship between DOC concentration and the depth to which UV radiation penetrates in lakes. Since DOC varies widely, freshwater systems display a wide range of sensitivity to UV penetration. In these systems, increased solar UV-B radiation is an additional stress factor that may change species composition and biomass productivity. The Arctic aquatic ecosystem is one of the most productive ecosystems on earth and is a source of fish and crustaceans for human consumption. Both endemic and migratory species breed and reproduce in this ocean in spring and early summer, at a time when recorded increases in W-B radiation are maximal. Productivity in the Arctic ocean has been reported to be higher and more heterogeneous than in the Antarctic ocean. In the Bering Sea, the sea-edge communities contribute about 40-50% of the total productivity. Because of the shallow water and the prominent stratification of the water layer, the phytoplankton are more exposed and affected by solar W-B radiation. In addition, many economically important fish (e.g., herring, pollock, cod and salmon) spawn in shallow waters where they are exposed to increased solar UV-B radiation. Many of the eggs and early larval stages are found at or near the surface. Consequently, reduced productivity of fish and other marine crops is possible but has not been demonstrated. There is increased consensus, covering a wide range of aquatic ecosystems, that environmental W-B, independent of ozone-related increases, is an important ecological stress that influences the growth, survival and distribution of phytoplankton. Polar ecosystems, where ozone-related UV-B increases are the greatest and which are globally significant ecosystems, are of particular concern. However, these ecosystems are characterized by large spatial and temporal variability, which makes it difficult to separate out UV-B-specific effects on single species or whole phytoplankton communities. There is clear evidence for short-term effects. In one study a 4-23% photoinhibition of photosystem II activity was measured under the ozone hole. However, extrapolation of short-term effects to long-term ecological consequences requires various complex effects to be accounted for and quantitative evaluation remains uncertain. (C) 1998 UNEP.

Although numerous plant traits influence the movement of specialist herbivores, few studies have examined movement responses of generalist herbivores to the variable ecological conditions associated with feeding and living on an array of host plants. We tested whether the movement patterns of two generalist caterpillars (Euclea delphinii Boisduval and Acharia stimulea Clemens, Limacodidae) differed on six different host tree species over 10 d. Because these tree species vary in the range of light environments in which they commonly grow, we also compared the movement responses of E. delphinii caterpillars to two contrasting light environments, sun and shade. For both caterpillar species, multiple measures of movement varied significantly among host tree species. In early censuses, movement rates and distances were highest on red oak and black cherry and lowest on white oak. Site fidelity was greatest on white oak and lowest on black cherry. Movement of both caterpillar species varied inversely with mean predator density on five of the six host trees. Other ecological predictors (e. g., leaf size and the density of other herbivores) were unrelated to movement. Light environment altered behavior such that caterpillars in the shade moved and fed more often, and moved greater distances, than caterpillars in the sun. Although the mechanism(s) promoting or inhibiting movement under these different conditions requires further study, the consequences of increased movement for caterpillar development and mortality from natural enemies are discussed.","[Stoepler, Teresa M.; Lill, John T.] George Washington Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Murphy, Shannon M.] Univ Denver, Dept Biol Sci, Denver, CO 80208 USA","Stoepler, TM (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",teresa.stoepler@gmail.com,"Murphy, Shannon M./Q-2139-2017","Murphy, Shannon M./0000-0002-5746-6536",NSF-DEBNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0642438],"Funding for this project came from NSF-DEB 0642438 to J.T.L.

There is an urgent need for decision support tools to enable effective management of colonies. We present a system dynamics model of the penguin population on Robben Island, South Africa, that combines a demographic simulation with the modelling of multiple pressures including food availability and food competition by commercial fisheries, oil spills, predation by terrestrial and marine predators, and extreme climate events. The model is stochastic, stage-specific and resource-driven, and incorporates both well-defined, quantitative field data and qualitative expert opinion. Survival rates for eggs, chicks, immatures and adults were adapted from field data and an earlier model of this population to create a simulation of a stable population used in a variety of scenarios and sensitivity tests. The modelled population was found to be strongly driven by food availability and to a lesser degree by oiling and marine predation, while climate events and terrestrial predation had low impacts. Food biomass levels (small pelagic fish) in the penguins' foraging area around the island (used during nesting) and further afield (used during the rest of the year) had an equal influence in driving population development in the short and long run. The impact of short-term (three years) fishing restrictions currently being trialled around the island was found to be generally beneficial to the modelled population, but easily masked by food-driven variability in population growth. The model produced population dynamics similar to those observed in 1988-2009 when immigration and a plausible change in predation pressure during this period were simulated. The model is being extended to other colonies to provide tools for specific management decisions and to enable the study of meta-populations by modelling migration between colonies. Our results suggest that improving food availability and mitigating the impact of oiling would have the highest beneficial impact on this penguin population. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A key feature of the movement of cells within in vivo environments is the interactions between motile cells and stationary obstacles. Here we propose a multi-species model of individual-level motility, proliferation and death. This model is a spatial birth-death-movement stochastic process, a class of individual-based model (IBM) that is amenable to mathematical analysis. We present the IBM in a general multi-species framework and then focus on the case of a population of motile, proliferative agents in an environment populated by stationary, non-proliferative obstacles. To analyse the IBM, we derive a system of spatial moment equations governing the evolution of the density of agents and the density of pairs of agents. This approach avoids making the usual mean-field assumption so that our models can be used to study the formation of spatial structure, such as clustering and aggregation, and to understand how spatial structure influences population-level outcomes. Overall the spatial moment model provides a reasonably accurate prediction of the system dynamics, including important effects such as how varying the properties of the obstacles leads to different spatial patterns in the population of agents.","[Surendran, Anudeep; Simpson, Matthew J.] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Plank, Michael J.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Math & Stat, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Plank, Michael J.] New Zealand Ctr Res Excellence, Punaha Matatini, Auckland, New Zealand","Simpson, MJ (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",matthew.simpson@qut.edu.au,"Plank, Michael John/H-8030-2019; Surendran, Anudeep/ABF-5218-2020","Plank, Michael John/0000-0002-7539-3465; Surendran, Anudeep/0000-0003-0777-4642","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP170100474]; Te Punaha Matatini, a New Zealand Centre of Research Excellence","This work is supported by the Australian Research Council (DP170100474).

A transplant/exclusion experiment was conducted to examine the effects of Upogebia pugettensis (Dana) on the abundance of other macro-infauna in a Pacific Northwest tideflat. Several numerically dominant, sedentary crustaceans and polychaetes exhibited lower abundances in the presence of Upogebia as compared to treatments where the mud shrimp was absent.

Agri-environment schemes (AES) are used extensively across Europe to address biodiversity declines in farmland. In England, Environmental Stewardship (ES) was introduced in 2005 to address the shortcomings of previous schemes, but as for schemes in other countries, assessments to date have revealed little evidence for national-scale biodiversity benefits. 2. Here, we assess the efficacy of ES in driving changes in national farmland bird populations over the period 20022010, using BTO/JNCC/RSPB Breeding Bird Survey data. We tested for associations between ES management options, grouped into categories reflecting intended biological effects (e.g. stubble), and species population growth rates, wherever benefits of management might be expected to occur. 3. We found strong evidence for positive effects of management that provides winter food resources (i.e. ES stubble and wild bird seed [WBS] crops) on population growth rates across multiple granivorous species, at three landscape scales. The results for management aiming to provide breeding season benefits (i.e. grassland, field margin and boundary [hedge, ditch] management) showed mixed patterns of positive and negative associations. 4. The results for stubble and WBS provide the first evidence for landscape-scale responses of biodiversity to AES management. The negative relationships identified may also show the importance of management context driving unforeseen predation or competition effects. 5. Synthesis and Applications. This study demonstrates that agri-environment scheme management has the potential to have national-scale effects on avian population growth rates, although our results suggest that some components of the scheme have had little effect on bird populations. Therefore, whilst this study provides the first proof-of-concept for broad-and-shallow scheme impacts on biodiversity, our results underline the importance of targeting towards population-limiting factors, here winter food resources. A combination of low uptake of key in-field options that provide winter seed and a failure to cover the late-winter period effectively explains the lack of national population responses. Such issues need to be addressed before schemes like Environmental Stewardship will achieve their goals. This study shows the value of feedback from monitoring for informing scheme design, through identifying problems and testing solutions.","[Baker, David J.; Siriwardena, Gavin M.] British Trust Ornithol, Thetford IP24 2PU, Norfolk, England; [Freeman, Stephen N.] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Grice, Phil V.] Nat England, Peterborough PE1 1UA, Cambs, England","Siriwardena, GM (corresponding author), British Trust Ornithol, Thetford IP24 2PU, Norfolk, England.",gavin.siriwardena@bto.org,"Baker, David/G-7483-2012; Freeman, Stephen/E-7267-2012","Baker, David/0000-0002-0466-8222",British Trust for Ornithology; Royal Society for the Protection of Birds; Joint Nature Conservation Committee; Natural England; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [CEH010021] Funding Source: researchfish,"We thank all BBS organisers and volunteers, especially Kate Risely.

The loss of large-bodied herbivores and/or top predators has been associated with large-scale changes in ecosystems around the world, but there remain important questions regarding the contexts in which such changes are most likely and the mechanisms through which they occur, particularly in marine ecosystems. We used long-term exclusion cages to examine the effects of large grazers (sea cows, Dugong dugon; sea turtles Chelonia mydas) on seagrass community structure, biomass and nutrient dynamics. Experiments were conducted in habitats with high risk of predation (interior of shallow banks) and lower risk (edges of banks) to elucidate whether nonconsumptive (risk) effects of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), a roving predator, structure herbivore impacts on seagrasses. In lower-risk habitats, excluding large herbivores resulted in increased leaf length for Cymodocea angustata and Halodule uninervis. C.angustata shoot densities nearly tripled when released from herbivory, while H.uninervis nearly disappeared from exclusion cages over the course of the study. We found no support for the hypothesis that grazing increases seagrass nutrient content. Instead, phosphorus content was higher in seagrasses within exclosures. This pattern is consistent with decreased light availability in the denser C.angustata canopies that formed in exclosures, and may indicate that competition for light led to the decrease in H.uninervis. Impacts of large grazers were consistent with a behaviour-mediated trophic cascade (BMTC) initiated by tiger sharks and mediated by risk-sensitive foraging by large grazers. Our results suggest that large-bodied grazers likely played important roles in seagrass ecosystem dynamics historically and that roving predators are capable of initiating a BMTC. Conservation efforts in coastal ecosystems must account for such interactions or risk unintended consequences.

In this study we experimentally investigated the effect of host plant shading on two willow-feeding leaf beetles, Galerucella lineola feeding upon Salix phylicifolia and Phratora, vitellinae feeding upon Salix myrsinifolia. Both beetle species were more abundant on potted willows growing in open habitats than on the same clones placed under the shade of trees. However, in the laboratory the food preference by adults and larval performance showed that the shaded willows are actually better food fur both beetle species. On the contrary, when larvae were reared in the field under natural abiotic conditions, we found no difference in larval performance, or if any, even better performance in open habitats. Apparently. higher and more variable daily temperatures in open habitats accelerated the growth of the larvae. When adults were let to emigrate from or immigrate to potted willows, which had been grown in the same conditions but placed either in the open or shady habitats, adults preferred exposed willows. Invertebrate predators were more abundant in open habitats, but we found no differences in lear beetle mortality by natural enemies between the habitats. Although the larval performance appeared to be approximately equal in the two habitats during the unusually warm study period, we suggest that under suboptimal temperatures the better abiotic conditions of open sites can easily override the better food provided by shaded habitats. The selection of abiotic habitat thus plays a significant role in the adaptive habitat and host plant selection of these beetles within the gradient of shadiness.","Univ Joensuu, Dept Biol, FIN-80101 Joensuu, Finland","Sipura, M (corresponding author), Univ Joensuu, Dept Biol, POB 111, FIN-80101 Joensuu, Finland.",mika.sipura@joensuu.fi,,,,,,60,38,40,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,DEC,2000,91,3,,,,,550,558,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.910317.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,398VQ,WOS:000166777500017,,,,,2021-09-27,

Most approaches to studying ecological thresholds in marine ecosystems tend to focus on populations, or on non-linearities in physical drivers. Here we argue that many of the observed thresholds observed at community and ecosystem levels can potentially be explained as the product of non-linearities that occur at three scales: (a) the mechanisms by which individual organisms interact with their ambient habitat, (b) the non-linear relationship between organismal physiological performance and variables such as body temperature and (c) the indirect effects of physiological stress on species interactions such as competition and predation. We explore examples at each of these scales in detail and explain why a failure to consider these non-linearities - many of which can be counterintuitive - can lead to Type II errors (a failure to predict significant ecological responses to climate change). Specifically, we examine why ecological thresholds can occur well before concomitant thresholds in physical drivers are observed, i.e. how even small linear changes in the physical environment can lead to ecological tipping points. We advocate for an integrated framework that combines biophysical, ecological and physiological methods to generate hypotheses that can be tested using experimental manipulation as well as hindcasting and nowcasting of observed change, on a spatially and temporally explicit basis.","[Monaco, Cristian J.; Helmuth, Brian] Univ S Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Monaco, Cristian J.; Helmuth, Brian] Univ S Carolina, Environm & Sustainabil Program, Columbia, SC 29208 USA","Monaco, CJ (corresponding author), Univ S Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",monacocj@email.sc.edu,"Helmuth, Brian/AAD-2664-2019","Helmuth, Brian/0000-0003-0180-3414; Monaco, Cristian/0000-0003-4057-5290",,,,178,63,63,2,103,ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0065-2881,2162-5875,978-0-12-385529-9,ADV MAR BIOL,Adv.

Histiobalantium bodamicum and Vorticella natans are common planktonic ciliates but their abundance, swimming behavior, and temperature tolerance are different. In contrast to most sessile peritrich species, the motile V. natans is not strictly bacterivorous but also voraciously feeds upon small algae. We observed three main alterations in the shape of NR of both species with temperature, that is, change in the maximum growth rate, in the initial slope and in the threshold food level needed to sustain the population. Similarly, maximum ingestion rate, gross growth efficiency (GGE), and cell size varied with temperature and species. These findings caution against generalizing ciliate performance in relation to the ongoing global warming. Our results suggest that V. natans is the superior competitor to H. bodamicum in terms of temperature tolerance and bottom-up control. However, the abundance of V. natans is usually low compared to H. bodamicum and other common freshwater ciliates, suggesting that V. natans is more strongly top-down controlled via predation than H. bodamicum. The taxonomic position of V. natans has been debated. Therefore, to confirm species and genus affiliation of our study objects, we sequenced their small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rDNA) gene.","[Lu, Xiaoteng; Weisse, Thomas] Univ Innsbruck, Res Dept Limnol, Mondseestr 9, A-5310 Mondsee, Austria; [Gao, Yunyi] Ocean Univ China, Inst Evolut & Marine Biodivers, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China","Lu, XT (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Res Dept Limnol, Mondseestr 9, A-5310 Mondsee, Austria.",xiaoteng.lu@student.uibk.ac.at,,,Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [I2238-B25]; project D.

Early experiments by Angus Bateman characterized this interaction, and the quantitative relationship between a male's number of mates and number of offspring is known as the Bateman slope. Sexual dimorphism, one of the most obvious results of sexual selection, largely requires a positive Bateman relationship, and the slope provides an estimate of the potential for sexual selection. However, natural selection from the environment can also influence male success, as can random effects, and some have argued for inclusion of the latter in calculations of mate success. Data from pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) reveal the presence of a positive Bateman slope in each year of a 10-year study. We found no evidence that random effects skewed male mating success; however, substantial yearly variation in the Bateman slope due to predation on fawns was evident. These results support the validity of the Bateman relationship, yet they also demonstrate that environmental or extrinsic influences can limit the potential for sexual selection.","[Byers, John; Dunn, Stacey] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Byers, J (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",jbyers@uidaho.edu,,,"U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [9808377, 0097115, 0738012]","We thank the dozens of field volunteers who helped build our data set, L.

Chemical cues are considered important for predator avoidance, foraging, larval settlement and broadcast spawning in aquatic environments. However, the significance of their role as drivers of direct interactions between heterospecifics has been largely overlooked. Methodology/Principal Findings: A video camera and a demarcated arena were used in situ to record behavioural responses of three native gastropod species, Assiminea cf. capensis, Melanoides tuberculata and Coriandria durbanensis, exposed to treatments representing chemical cues released by a non-native invasive gastropod, Tarebia granifera. The responses were measured quantitatively as displacement and orientation of movement at locations in St Lucia Estuary, within the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site on the east coast of South Africa. All native gastropods exhibited a negative taxis response to chemical cues released by T. granifera, while T. granifera individuals responded randomly to conspecifics. Displacement was measured relative to the source of the extract, the number of steps taken were determined with path analysis and orientation was determined from the mean (+/- 95% CIs) turning angles, with significant negative turning angles representing negative taxis. Responses to treatments corresponding to the environment and conspecifics were random and undirected, indicating kinesis. Conclusion/Significance: This study presents evidence for interactions driven by chemical cues between a non-native invasive gastropod and several gastropods native to South Africa. The results indicate that chemical cues can facilitate invasion success as the behavioural response of native gastropods is to move away allowing additional food and space resources to become available to T. granifera.","[Raw, Jacqueline L.; Miranda, Nelson A.

Sampling was conducted on four occasions at 20, 32, 44 and 56 days post-planting. Infestation of maize by fall armyworm larvae, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), was more than twice as great in plots with strict weed control compared with weedy plots at 20 days post-planting, but declined thereafter in both treatments. The prevalence of aphid infestation and the abundance of nitidulid beetles were consistently greater in weed-controlled plots. In contrast, the density of beneficial predatory Coleoptera increased significantly in plots with weeds, and it is suggested that this probably explains the lower incidence of pests. S. frugiperda egg masses placed in experimental plots suffered a significantly higher incidence rate of parasitism by Chelonus insularis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in clean plots (42.0%) compared with those placed in weedy plots (3.75%); it is suspected that weeds may hinder the location of egg masses by parasitoids. Overall, the presence or absence of weeds had a marked influence on the arthropod community present in maize fields. The weeds did not affect maize plant height, the levels of plant damage or the yield of grain from plants under each type of weed regime, implying that competitive effects of weeds may be offset by greater numbers of beneficial insects in weedy plots. Our pilot study indicates that strict weed control in maize may be unnecessary.","ECOSUR, Tapachula 30700, Chiapas, Mexico; Fac Ciencias Agricolas, UNACH, Huehuetan, Chiapas, Mexico; Univ Southampton, Dept Biol, Harpenden SO16 7PX, Herts, England; IACR Rothamsted, Plant & Invertebrate Ecol Div, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Prod Agraria, E-31006 Pamplona, Spain; Escuela Agricola Panamer, El Zamorano, Honduras","Williams, T (corresponding author), ECOSUR, Apdo Postal 36, Tapachula 30700, Chiapas, Mexico.",,"Chapman, Jason/H-8236-2012; Williams, Trevor/J-4239-2013; Williams, Trevor/F-1447-2011; Williams, Trevor/ABG-3961-2020; Caballero, Primitivo/D-5063-2009; Goulson, David/A-2462-2010; Valle, Javier/C-4570-2017","Williams, Trevor/0000-0003-3414-3440; Williams, Trevor/0000-0003-3414-3440; Caballero, Primitivo/0000-0003-0065-9625; Goulson, David/0000-0003-4421-2876; Chapman, Jason/0000-0002-7475-4441; Valle, Javier/0000-0003-0254-5701",,,,41,19,22,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-0874,,,INT J PEST MANAGE,Int.

Here we examine if logging -a prevalent activity in the tropics- drives a pattern of differential defaunation in a Neotropical forest managed by a community of indigenous people. Using a match-paired design, we conducted mammalian surveys during four consecutive years in three independent sites, each one including (1) areas for logging practiced by Maya communities of the Yucatan Peninsula (selective and interspaced harvesting), and (2) adjacent areas set aside as reserves. We found that in logged areas the abundance of medium and large mammals decreased (4.3-fold, overall), while the abundance of small mammals increased (2.5-fold, overall). We posit that these changes result from a combination of factors, including: (1) facilitated access for hunters of medium- and large-sized game, comprising both predators (potentially leading to small-prey release) and competitors of small-bodied species; (2) changes in vegetation (e.g., more shelter and food for rodents); and (3) contrasting animal life history traits (population growth rate, home range size). We conclude that although non-intensive logging interventions have negative consequences for the mammalian community (for at least ten years after harvesting), the indigenous practices of rotational harvesting and maintaining reserves help to prevent the landscape-wide mammalian declines known to occur under large-scale industrial logging.","[Gutierrez-Granados, Gabriel; Dirzo, Rodolfo] UNAM, Fac Estudios Super Zaragoza, UMIEZ, Batalla 5 Mayo S-N Esquina Fuerte Loreto, Ciudad De Mexico 09320, Mexico; [Dirzo, Rodolfo] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, 327 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Dirzo, Rodolfo] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, 327 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Gutierrez-Granados, G (corresponding author), UNAM, Fac Estudios Super Zaragoza, UMIEZ, Batalla 5 Mayo S-N Esquina Fuerte Loreto, Ciudad De Mexico 09320, Mexico.",gabrielgg@comunidad.unam.mx,,"Gutierrez, Gabriel/0000-0002-5967-7425",CONABIO [BJ045]; UNAMUniversidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); CONABIO; Instituto de Ecologia (UNAM)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Stanford UniversityStanford University,"This project was funded by CONABIO (project BJ045).

Standardised faunal communities, collected from the extreme low intertidal zone using artificial substrate units, were exposed to one of eight nominal treatments (four pH levels: 8.0, 7.7, 7.3 and 6.7, crossed with two temperature levels: 12 and 16 degrees C). After 60 days exposure communities showed significant changes in structure and lower diversity in response to reduced pH. The response to temperature was more complex. At higher pH levels (8.0 and 7.7) elevated temperature treatments contained higher species abundances and diversity than the lower temperature treatments. In contrast, at lower pH levels (7.3 and 6.7), elevated temperature treatments had lower species abundances and diversity than lower temperature treatments. The species losses responsible for these changes in community structure and diversity were not randomly distributed across the different phyla examined. Molluscs showed the greatest reduction in abundance and diversity in response to low pH and elevated temperature, whilst annelid abundance and diversity was mostly unaffected by low pH and was higher at the elevated temperature. The arthropod response was between these two extremes with moderately reduced abundance and diversity at low pH and elevated temperature. Nematode abundance increased in response to low pH and elevated temperature, probably due to the reduction of ecological constraints, such as predation and competition, caused by a decrease in macrofaunal abundance. This community-based mesocosm study supports previous suggestions, based on observations of direct physiological impacts, that ocean acidification induced changes in marine biodiversity will be driven by differential vulnerability within and between different taxonomical groups. This study also illustrates the importance of considering indirect effects that occur within multispecies assemblages when attempting to predict the consequences of ocean acidification and global warming on marine communities.","[Hale, R.; Calosi, P.] Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Hale, R.; McNeill, L.; Widdicombe, S.] Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England; [Mieszkowska, N.] Marine Biol Assoc United Kingdom Lab, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England","Hale, R (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.",r.hale1@uea.ac.uk,"Hale, Rachel/L-2464-2014; Mieszkowska, Nova/U-8479-2019","Hale, Rachel/0000-0001-5079-5954; Mieszkowska, Nova/0000-0002-9570-7759; Calosi, Piero/0000-0003-3378-2603",NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); European CommunityEuropean Commission [211384]; RCUKUK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [mba010002] Funding Source: researchfish,"This work is a contribution to the NERC-funded programme Oceans 2025 (PML Theme 3 - Coastal and shelf processes) and the European Project on Ocean Acidification (EPOCA) which received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 211384.

Therefore, selection on the ability and accuracy of kin recognition to avoid losses in inclusive fitness is expected. Competition and relatedness are two key factors for the evolution of siblicide and cannibalism. However, our knowledge of the temporal dynamics and the accuracy of kin-mediated siblicide and cannibalism is scarce and experiments have usually focused on either relatedness (kin recognition) or weight asymmetry (dominance and competition) as independent components. In an experiment we set up mixed-kinship groups of three nymphs of the European earwig, Forficula auricularia Linnaeus, a gregarious and (sub-) social species, to investigate the combined effects of relatedness and weight asymmetry on the temporal dynamics of siblicide and cannibalism. We found that the temporal dynamics were jointly influenced by relatedness and weight asymmetry among nymphs. Weight asymmetry effects on siblicide and cannibalism were stronger between unrelated individuals than between related individuals as shown by a significant relatedness*weight asymmetry interaction on survival patterns. The opportunity to choose between related and unrelated individuals did not enhance the accuracy of kin recognition but induced the above interaction between relatedness and weight asymmetry on cannibalistic outcomes. These results show that relatedness and weight affect siblicidal and cannibalistic behaviour, and that their combined effect depends on the social context.

Aborted fruits are usually disqualified from studies of both fruit production and seed dispersal. However, a considerable number of developing seeds occur within immature aborted fruits. We evaluated the untested hypotheses that seeds within aborted fruits are viable and that incomplete predation of seeds within aborted fruits by hoarding rodents provides, in addition to seed movement, increased germination and seedling emergence. To this end, we studied the system composed by the Iberian pear Pyrus bourgaeana and several rodent species in Mediterranean Spain. About a third of aborted fruits found beneath tree canopies (n = 2430) were partially eaten by rodents. Using a seed sowing experiment, we revealed that a considerable fraction of seeds from P. bourgaeana aborted fruits are viable, germinating, and emerging seedlings. Paradoxically, however, these seeds are de facto unviable since they are confined within the extremely hard pericarp of aborted fruits, which prevents any seedling emergence and thus any contribution to tree recruitment. We show that only when rodents partially gnaw the pericarp walls of aborted fruits, seeds that escaped from predation have the prospect of emerging and thus potentially contributing to tree regeneration. Thus, in this and probably in many other similar synzoochore systems, rodents act as rescuers of seeds confined within aborted fruits, conferring the plants a largely overlooked benefit that could shape the reproductive strategy of many plant species.","[Fedriani, Jose M.] CSIC UVEG GV, Ctr Invest Desertificac CIDE, Carretera Moncada Naquera,Km 4,5, Valencia 46113, Spain; [Fedriani, Jose M.; Calvo, Gemma; Delibes, Miguel] Estn Biol Donana EBD CSIC, C Amer Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Ayllon, Daniel] Complutense Univ Madrid UCM, Dept Biodivers Ecol & Evolut, C Jose Antonio Novais 12, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Garrote, Pedro J.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Appl Ecol Prof Baeta Neves InBio, Lisbon, Portugal","Fedriani, JM (corresponding author), CSIC UVEG GV, Ctr Invest Desertificac CIDE, Carretera Moncada Naquera,Km 4,5, Valencia 46113, Spain.; Fedriani, JM (corresponding author), Estn Biol Donana EBD CSIC, C Amer Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain.",fedriani@csic.es,"Ayllon, Daniel/K-6862-2019; Fedriani, Jose/R-1328-2018","Ayllon, Daniel/0000-0001-7539-5287; Fedriani, Jose/0000-0002-1581-2621","Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceSpanish Government [PGC2018-094808-B-I00]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/130527/2017]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [CGL2017-84269-P]","This research was financed by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science (PGC2018-094808-B-I00).

The leafminer supported 12 parasitoid species. Eight abundant or common species were classified into five guilds according to their koinobiont/idiobiont mode and host-instar utilization pattern: early larval koinobiont, mid-larval idiobiont, mid-larval-late idiobiont, late larval-pupal idiobiont, and pupal idiobiont. The early larval koinobiont (Orgilus Kunatai) and mid-larval idiobiont (Achrysocharoides sp.) seemed to be specialized on the host, whereas the members of the other guilds had a wide host range. The mid-larval-late larval (Cirrospilus diallus and Pnigalio sp.) or late larval-pupal idiobionts (Chrysocharis albipes, Apleurotropis kumatai, and Pleurotroppopsis japonica) facultatively hyperparasitized half of spinning larvae or pupae of the early larval koinobiont.

Here, we use individual tag data on juvenile salmonids to quantify how their geographic, taxonomic, and life-history representation in the diets of great blue herons (Ardea herodias) changed after a pair of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) usurped the colony's nesting site, forcing the colony to relocate. Heron diet composition changed significantly despite the short relocation distance (4.1 km). This was driven by a shift in space use, as herons to a greater extent began consuming fish from a river basin farther away from the bald eagle nest. As a consequence the species composition in heron diets changed significantly, with the largest increase in coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and largest decrease in Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha). The representation of Chinook life-history types in the diets also shifted. Fall Chinook was the numerically dominant life-history type in the diets but decreased relative to spring and summer Chinook following relocation, accounting for differences in availability. Expressed by rearing type (natural or hatchery-produced), the prevalence of natural-origin Chinook in the diets increased whereas hatchery-origin Chinook decreased. For steelhead rearing type there were no significant changes. Finally, herons increased their use of a nearby tributary watershed following the relocation. Notwithstanding the potential confounding factors inherent to natural experiments, our results demonstrated marked shifts in space use among herons in response to the relocation and continued presence of bald eagles, which in turn shifted their predation pressure to other salmonid species.","[Myrvold, Knut Marius; Kennedy, Brian Patrick] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow 83844, ID USA; [Kennedy, Brian Patrick] Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Kennedy, Brian Patrick] Univ Idaho, Dept Geol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Myrvold, Knut Marius] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, N-2624 Lillehammer, Norway","Myrvold, KM (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, N-2624 Lillehammer, Norway.",knut.marius.myrvold@gmail.com,,,United States Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; United States Bureau of Reclamation,"This study was supported by grants from the United States Geological Survey and the United States Bureau of Reclamation.

Here, the ecology of early life stages of Holothuria floridana was investigated. In laboratory experiments, females released a small number of oocytes, which underwent abbreviated lecithotrophic development. During broadcast spawning, some of the negatively buoyant and sticky oocytes settled on the adults where they remained anchored up to the pentactula stage (encapsulated). Several wild adults collected in the Placencia Lagoon (Belize) each hosted similar to 2 propagules (eggs, blastulae, pentactulae, juveniles). The nursery habitat was characterized by high adult density, shallow seagrass beds close to mangroves, and mud dominated substrata. The present work illustrates a unique facultative offspring-adult association in a free-spawning lecithotrophic species of Holothuroidea, possibly representing a hybrid state between broadcasting and external brooding. This uncommon reproductive feature may ensure successful local recruitment in one of the most competitive habitats of the tropical Americas, where predation pressure is likely to be very high.","[Rogers, Arlenie] Univ Belize, Environm Res Inst, Belmopan City, Belize; [Hamel, Jean-Francois] Soc Explorat & Valuing Environm SEVE, St Philips, NF, Canada; [Quetzal, Junior] Univ Belize, Fac Sci & Technol, Biol Program, Belmopan City, Belize; [Mercier, Annie] Mem Univ, Dept Ocean Sci, St John, NF, Canada","Rogers, A (corresponding author), Univ Belize Environm Res Inst UBERI, Belmopan City, Belize.",arogers@ub.edu.bz,,"Hamel, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-0435-4127; Mercier, Annie/0000-0003-0807-2378",Bel-Euro Aquaculture Ltd.,This work was supported by the Bel-Euro Aquaculture Ltd.,,90,0,0,2,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0792-4259,2157-0272,,INVERTEBR REPROD DEV,Invertebr.

The objective was to understand herdsmen's perceptions and attitudes towards rangeland fencing, gazelle protection and control of wolf predation on livestock. A total of 251 families of herdsmen were randomly selected for face-to-face interviews in March 2011 (100 families), 2012 (65 families), and 2013 (86 families). The interview results showed that the herdsmen had a strong willingness to protect the gazelle and most of the interviewees were willing to reduce the height of their rangeland fences, but few herdsmen were willing to completely remove fencing without compensation. Although the responses from the herdsmen suggested that they would like to see some gazelle grazing on their rangeland, they considered the gazelle as a competitor with their livestock for grass herbage. The majority of herdsmen interviewed had suffered from some loss of livestock due to wolf predation, and most of them considered wolf predation a serious problem, particularly to their sheep. Most of them thus did not want to see an increase in the number and distribution of wolves, but none of the interviewees would kill wolves. The herdsmen's belief in Tibetan Buddhism played an important role in influencing the attitudes of the herdsmen towards wolves and the gazelle. These interview results suggest that the herdsmen, as key stakeholders, need to be considered and involved in the development and implementation of any program to protect the gazelle, recovery of wolf populations and maintain rangeland ecosystems.","[Shi, Jianbin; Li, Xiaowen] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [You, Wenyuan; Lu, Feiying; Zhang, Zihui] Capital Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100043, Peoples R China","Shi, JB (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",jianbin.shi@gmail.com,,,Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30970373]; Environmental Protection Public Interest Program [201209033]; Scientific Support Program [2012BAC01B02-4],"This study was funded by Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No.: 30970373), Environmental Protection Public Interest Program (Project No.: 201209033) and Scientific Support Program (Project No.: 2012BAC01B02-4).

Movement patterns offer a rich source of information on animal behaviour and the ecological significance of landscape attributes. This is especially useful for species occupying remote landscapes where direct behavioural observations are limited. In this study, we fit a mechanistic model of animal cognition and movement to GPS positional data of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou; Gmelin 1788) collected over a wide range of ecological conditions. 2. The model explicitly tracks individual animal informational state over space and time, with resulting parameter estimates that have direct cognitive and ecological meaning. Three biotic landscape attributes were hypothesized to motivate caribou movement: forage abundance (dietary digestible biomass), wolf (Canis lupus; Linnaeus, 1758) density and moose (Alces alces; Linnaeus, 1758) habitat. Wolves are the main predator of caribou in this system and moose are their primary prey. 3. Resulting parameter estimates clearly indicated that forage abundance is an important driver of caribou movement patterns, with predator and moose avoidance often having a strong effect, but not for all individuals. From the cognitive perspective, our results support the notion that caribou rely on limited sensory inputs from their surroundings, as well as on long-term spatial memory, to make informed movement decisions. Our study demonstrates how sensory, memory and motion capacities may interact with ecological fitness covariates to influence movement decisions by free-ranging animals.","[Avgar, Tal; Baker, James A.; Kittle, Andrew M.; Mallon, Erin E.; McGreer, Madeleine T.; Mosser, Anna; Newmaster, Steven G.; Street, Garrett M.; Turetsky, Merritt J.; Fryxell, John M.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Brown, Glen S.] Ontario Minist Nat Resources, Ontario Wildlife Populat Monitoring Program, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2E5, Canada; [Hagens, Jevon S.; Reid, Douglas E.

Larvae of this subspecies exhibit one of two feeding phenotypes; typical larvae eat zooplankton and macroinvertebrates and cannibalistic larvae feed primarily on conspecifics. Previous laboratory experiments showed that larval density positively affected expression of the cannibalistic phenotype. In this study we tested the hypothesis that size variation among larvae also serves as a cue triggering development of the cannibalistic phenotype. We report laboratory experiments and field observations showing that both an individual larva's position in a size distribution and the amount of size variation among larvae serve as cues stimulating development of cannibalistic larvae. Larval density and population size structure provide a larva with an indication of the abundance and vulnerability of potential conspecific prey. Size variation among larvae, in turn, appears to be influenced by larval density.

Due to the specificity of trophic interactions, banker plants may not efficiently promote natural enemies with different ecologies. Yet in most cropping systems, different pest species are present together and require different biocontrol agents to efficiently control them. In the present study, we tested the combined use of two banker plants and their associated prey/host to enhance populations of the specialist parasitoid Encarsia formosa targeting the main tomato pest Bemisia tabaci, and a polyphagous ladybird Propylea japonica targeting the secondary pest Myzus persicae in tomato crops. In a laboratory and a greenhouse experiment, we measured the abundances of these four species using the Ricinus communis-Trialeurodes ricini banker plant system alone, in combination with the Glycines max-Megoura japonica system, or in absence of banker plants. We found that the first banker plant system enhanced populations of E. formosa, resulting in increased suppression of B. tabaci populations and the suppression of their outbreak in both our laboratory and greenhouse experiment. Conversely, abundances of P. japonica were not affected by this first system, but were significantly increased when the second was present. This resulted in increased control of M. persicae populations and the suppression of their early and late outbreaks. Our study demonstrates the potential for combined banker plants to provide long-term, sustainable control of multiple pests by their target natural enemies in complex agroecosystems.","[Chen, Xu; Zang, Lian-Sheng] Guizhou Univ, Key Lab Green Pesticide & Agr Engn, Minist Educ PR China, Guiyang, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xu; Jaworski, Coline C.; Guo, Xiaojun; Wang, Su] Beijing Acad Agr & Forestry Sci, Inst Plant & Environm Protect, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jaworski, Coline C.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Jaworski, Coline C.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Dai, Huijie] Weifang Univ Sci & Technol, Weifang, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Liang, Yuyong] Jiangxi Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Desneux, Nicolas] Univ Cote Azur, UMR ISA, CNRS, INRAE, F-06000 Nice, France","Zang, LS (corresponding author), Guizhou Univ, Key Lab Green Pesticide & Agr Engn, Minist Educ PR China, Guiyang, Guizhou, Peoples R China.; Wang, S (corresponding author), Beijing Acad Agr & Forestry Sci, Inst Plant & Environm Protect, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wangsu@ipepbaafs.cn; lsz0415@163.com,,"Jaworski, Coline/0000-0002-6136-8656","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [32072479]; National Key Research and Development Programme of China [2017YFD0201000, 2018YFD0200402]; Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management of Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China [BZ0432]; Beijing Science and Technology Project [z201100008020014]; Key Research and Development Programme of the Jiangxi Province [202002BBF62006]; Key Research and Development Programme of Shandong (Public Welfare) [2019GSF109118]","The study was funded by the project 32072479 supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, the National Key Research and Development Programme of China (2017YFD0201000; 2018YFD0200402), the Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management of Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China (BZ0432), the Beijing Science and Technology Project (z201100008020014), the Key Research and Development Programme of the Jiangxi Province (202002BBF62006), and the Key Research and Development Programme of Shandong (Public Welfare; 2019GSF109118).",,70,0,0,5,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1612-4758,1612-4766,,J PEST SCI,J.

Pond sticklebacks were more active feeders, more risk-taking, aggressive and explorative than marine sticklebacks. Perceived predation risk decreased aggression and risk-taking of all fish. Food restriction increased feeding activity and risk-taking. Pond sticklebacks became more risk-taking than marine sticklebacks under food shortage, whereas well-fed fish behaved similarly. Among poorly fed fish, males showed higher drive to feed, whereas among well-fed fish, females did. Apart from showing how evolutionary history, ontogenetic experience and sex influence behaviour, the results provide evidence for habitat-dependent expression of adaptive phenotypic plasticity.","[Herczeg, G.; Valimaki, K.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Ecol Genet Res Unit, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Herczeg, G (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Ecol Genet Res Unit, POB 65, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",gabor.herczeg@helsinki.fi,"Herczeg, Gabor/AAF-9978-2020; Herczeg, Gabor/AAZ-1661-2021","Herczeg, Gabor/0000-0003-0441-342X",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission; Finnish Graduate School in Population Genetics,"Pirkko Siikamaki, Riku Paavola, Pia Rannanen, Goran Englund, Jenni Hamalainen, Jacquelin DeFaveri and Tuomas Leinonen helped to obtain the parental fish.

Frogs can respond to habitat features in varied scales, including types of bodies of water and microhabitats within them, and the correspondence between male and female choices may contribute to a successful reproduction. We compared habitat and microhabitat choices by males and females of a Scinax species from the catharinae clade, focusing on microhabitat selection by both sexes, including variation between dry and wet seasons. We also compared the distribution of males and females across a stream size gradient and related their abundance with numbers of tadpoles in each stream to assess successful breeding. We found males and females to be similar in microhabitat preferences, but their abundances did not correlate across streams. Male abundance, however, correlated with number of tadpoles, including that number of females may have been underestimated due to their shorter permanence at breeding sites or lower detection probability. Competition and predation did not seem to influence distribution of Scinax gr. catharinae among streams. Male and female Scinax gr. catharinae seem to show highly coordinated responses when selecting breeding habitats and microhabitats, apparently resulting in high breeding success at the study site.","[Eterovick, Paula C.; Ferreira, Arquimedes D.

An array of mensurative experiments and correlative analyses were used to examine the role of potential limiting factors. Absence of oysters was associated with symptoms of eutrophication, including elevated nutrient concentrations and turbidity. Oysters were also absent from all sites where water control structures resulted in minimal tidal exchange. Predation and competition did not appear to play a major role in surveyed oyster populations above Mean Lower Low Water but at lower elevations oysters were heavily fouled by non-native species. In most sites oysters were found only on large artificial substrates; survival on small natural hard substrates was apparently precluded by burial by fine sediments. Restoring more natural ecosystem processes by reducing nutrient and sediment inputs, increasing tidal exchange to areas behind water control structures, and preventing establishment of new non-native species would benefit Olympia oysters as well as support broader ecosystem-based management goals.","Elkhorn Slough Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Watsonville, CA 95076 USA","Wasson, K (corresponding author), Elkhorn Slough Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, 1700 Elkhorn Rd, Watsonville, CA 95076 USA.",kerstin.wasson@gmail.com,,,Estuarine Reserve Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"X.

This purely carnivorous species usually becomes a facultative piscivore after two discrete food niche shifts. Perch biomass has been observed to decrease in lakes along the productivity gradient, and then be replaced by cyprinids in non-manipulated eutrophic systems. Until now, this change has been mainly attributed to the competitive superiority of cyprinids for zooplankton prey during the juvenile phase of perch, while the piscivorous phase - as a possible factor influencing the recruitment success of perch - has been neglected. As the abundance of suitably sized prey fish should not be limiting in highly productive systems, we hypothesise that the switch from benthivorous feeding to preying on fish is inhibited by the reduced visibility in eutrophic lakes. We tested this hypothesis in laboratory experiments, where perch were fed two size classes of juvenile cyprinids at different phytoplankton - and bentonite-induced turbidity levels. Predation success was significantly influenced by turbidity level and turbidity source, but not by prey size. These experimental results suggest for the first time that piscivory of Eurasian perch is negatively influenced by different sources of turbidity, and hence low visibility might delay the onset of the food niche shift to fish prey.","Dresden Univ Technol, Inst Hydrobiol, D-01062 Dresden, Germany","Radke, R (corresponding author), Dresden Univ Technol, Inst Hydrobiol, Helmholtzstr 10, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",radke@rcs.urz.tu-dresden.de,,,,,,26,40,41,1,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0028-1042,,,NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN,Naturwissenschaften,FEB,2005,92,2,,,,,91,94,,10.1007/s00114-004-0596-7,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,895WT,WOS:000226895400008,15602682,,,,2021-09-27,

Habitat heterogeneity underlies resource variation and influences spatial variation in demography and the distribution of populations. We relate nest site productivity at multiple scales measured over a decade to habitat quality in a box-nesting population of Forpus passerinus (green-rumped parrotlets) in Venezuela to examine critical IFD assumptions. Variation in reproductive success at the local population and neighborhood scales had a much larger influence on productivity (fledglings per nest box per year) than nest site or female identity. Habitat features were reliable cues of nest site quality. Nest sites with less vegetative cover produced greater numbers of fledglings than sites with more cover. However, there was also a competitive cost to nesting in high-quality, low-vegetative cover nest boxes, as these sites experienced the most infanticide events. In the lowland local population, water depth and cover surrounding nest sites were related with F. passerinus productivity. Low vegetative cover and deeper water were associated with lower predation rates, suggesting that predation could be a primary factor driving habitat selection patterns. Parrotlets also demonstrated directional dispersal. Pairs that changed nest sites were more likely to disperse from poor-quality nest sites to high-quality nest sites rather than vice versa, and juveniles were more likely to disperse to, or remain in, the more productive of the two local populations. Parrotlets exhibited three characteristics fundamental to the IFD: habitat heterogeneity within and between local populations, reliable habitat cues to productivity, and active dispersal to sites of higher fitness.","[Bonebrake, Timothy C.; Beissinger, Steven R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ecosyst Sci Div, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Bonebrake, TC (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, 371 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",tcbone@stanford.edu,"Beissinger, Steven R/F-3809-2012; Bonebrake, Timothy Carlton/I-3850-2012; Bonebrake, Timothy Carlton/M-3559-2019","Bonebrake, Timothy Carlton/0000-0001-9999-2254","CNRConsiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); UC Berkeley; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-9503194, IBN-0113173]; National Zoological ParkSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society","We are indebted to the many tireless Forpus team field assistants over the years, including the 2004 team of Karl Berg, Laryssa Ron Esteves, Douglas Schaefer, and Mandy Walker.

That only a fraction of those refugees live in designated camps with the overwhelming majority spread about the country has led to hostile sentiments among some natives who blame Syrians for taking away their jobs. Still, research about the impact of Syrians on Turkish labour market outcomes is too limited. Empirical findings analysing micro-level data find either no impact or just abysmall changes to natives' formal employment rates but rather declines in rates of informal employment. This paper presents the findings of a three-month fieldwork in Istanbul's informal textile sector. Looking at the issue from the view of employers, it shows that on average country-level findings of the empirical analysis might be quite simplifying and sometimes inconsistent depending on the context. By just looking at the issue in a specific/neighbourhood setting, namely informal textile sector in a rather homogenous urban neighbourhood where the main competition in jobs are between Kurds and Syrians, this study shows that employment rates of natives declined in that specific field due to other factors independent of the Syrians and interestingly even predating their arrival to Turkey. The war-fleeing migrants are understood to have rather taken jobs no longer desired by the natives and generally paid lower wages than natives for doing them. This study particularly raises the role of skill gaps in the local market, changes in the meaning of work in the local population and informal-formal sector interdependence due to price pressures by global value chains in understanding the effect of refugees on locals' labour market outcomes.","[Kayaoglu, Aysegul] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey","Kayaoglu, A (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.",kayaogluyilmaz@itu.edu.tr,"Kayaoglu, Aysegul/L-8027-2015; kayaoglu, aysegul/AAM-2605-2021","Kayaoglu, Aysegul/0000-0003-1484-184X; ",,,,29,2,2,0,0,TRANSNATIONAL PRESS LONDON,LONDON,"12 RIDGEWAY GARDENS, LONDON, N6 5XR, ENGLAND",1741-8984,1741-8992,,MIGR LETT,Migr.

Invasive Rattus rattus consumption of Hibiscadelphus giffardianus (Malvaceae; common Hawaiian name hau kuahiwi) fruit and seeds has been hypothesized to be the most-limiting factor inhibiting the critically endangered tree, but this has not been experimentally tested, and little is known about other factors affecting seed dispersal, germination, and seedling establishment. Thus, we do not know if rat removal is sufficient to increase hau kuahiwi recruitment. This study aims to evaluate the effect of rat population control on the ability of hau kuahiwi to retain fruit and establish seedlings. We compared hau kuahiwi fruiting and seedling recruitment in a stand treated to reduce rat abundance and a neighbouring control stand. Fruit retention increased following treatment but seedling establishment did not. Although rat control improves the ability of hau kuahiwi to retain fruit, other, presently unknown inhibitors to seed dispersal, germination, and/or seedling development remain. Seed and seedling predation by other species, competition from numerous invasive plant species, unsuitable climate, and/or other factors may be primary inhibitors in the absence of rats, but we emphasize that progressive isolation of these factors at individual hau kuahiwi life stages may be necessary to identify the remaining threats to the conservation of this critically endangered plant.","[Gill, Nathan S.; Yelenik, Stephanie; Banko, Paul] US Geol Survey, Pacific Isl Ecosyst Res Ctr, Hawaii Volcanoes Natl Pk, Volcano, HI 96785 USA; [Gill, Nathan S.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Dixon, Christopher B.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Stat, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Jaenecke, Kelly; Peck, Robert] Univ Hawaii Hilo, Hawaii Cooperat Studies Unit, Hawaii Volcanoes Natl Pk, Hilo, HI USA","Gill, NS (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Pacific Isl Ecosyst Res Ctr, Hawaii Volcanoes Natl Pk, Volcano, HI 96785 USA.; Gill, NS (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",nsgill@wisc.edu,"Yelenik, Stephanie/ABC-8265-2020","Yelenik, Stephanie/0000-0002-9011-0769; Gill, Nathan/0000-0003-1496-8197","National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [2015187717]; NSF Graduate Research Internship Program; U.S. Geological Survey through the Natural Resources Preservation Program (NRPP, with National Park Service); Science Support Program (SSP, with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service); Ecosystems Mission Area","This work was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF; https://nsf.gov/) Graduate Research Fellowship No. 2015187717 (Nathan S Gill), an internship provided through the NSF Graduate Research Internship Program (Nathan S Gill and Stephanie Yelenik), and through the U.S. Geological Survey through the Natural Resources Preservation Program (NRPP, with National Park Service), Science Support Program (SSP, with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), and Ecosystems Mission Area.

Grey wolves (Canis lupus) and human hunters both provide resource subsidies to scavengers by provisioning them with the remains of their kills. Carrion from hunter kills is highly aggregated in time and space whereas carrion from wolf kills is more dispersed in both time and space. We estimated the total amount of carrion consumed by each scavenger species at both wolf and hunter kills over 4 years. Species with large feeding radii [bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and ravens (Corpus corax)], defined as the area over which a consumer can efficiently locate and integrate resources, dominated consumption at the highly aggregated hunter kills whereas competitively dominant species [coyotes (Canis latrans)] dominated at the more dispersed wolf kills. In addition, species diversity and the evenness of carrion consumption between scavengers was greater at wolf kills than at hunter kills while the total number of scavengers at hunter kills exceeded those at wolf kills. From a community perspective, the top-down effect of predation is likely to be stronger in the vicinity of highly aggregated resource pulses as species with large feeding radii switch to feeding on alternative prey once the resource pulse subsides.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Natl Pk Serv, Yellowstone Ctr Resources, Yellowstone Wolf Project, Yellowstone Natl Pk, WY 82190 USA; Yellowstone Ecol Res Ctr, Bozeman, MT USA","Wilmers, CC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"Getz, Wayne/I-4521-2013","Getz, Wayne/0000-0001-8784-9354",,,,35,138,138,1,95,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-023X,,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Here, we aim to quantify variation in individual spacing behaviour and its correlates in a group of wild Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis) in north-eastern Thailand, which experiences both predation pressure and within-group feeding competition. Data on individual spatial positions were collected during group scans using GPS devices and results suggest that both group cohesiveness and individual spatial positions within a group can be adjusted to mediate the costs and benefits of group living. Individuals had greater nearest neighbour distances and lower numbers of close neighbours when the group was feeding, compared to when the main group activity was resting/social or moving. This is likely due to the high costs of proximity associated with feeding competition. Immature individuals and females with young infants which are more vulnerable to predation were located closer to the centre of the group than both adult males and females without infants. This indicates the importance of predation risk in driving individual spatial position. Among adults, higher ranking individuals occupied more central positions within the group while lower ranking individuals were more peripheral. It appears that low ranking individuals trade reduced feeding interference and improved feeding success for increased predation risk. This could help explain why females in the study population do not display a rank related skew in energy intake.","[Heesen, Marlies; Macdonald, Sally; Ostner, Julia] Univ Gottingen, Primate Social Evolut Grp, Courant Res Ctr Evolut Social Behav, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Schuelke, Oliver] Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Evolut Social Behav, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Heesen, M (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Primate Social Evolut Grp, Courant Res Ctr Evolut Social Behav, Kellnerweg 6, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",marlies.heesen@zentr.uni-goettingen.de,,,Max Planck SocietyMax Planck Society; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; University of Gottingen through German Initiative of Excellence,"We thank the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT) and the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP) for permission (No. 0004.3/3618) to conduct this study.

Despite theoretical expectations for situations in which either no, or positive, or negative density-dependence should be observed, most studies document only negative density-dependence for trophically transmitted parasites. However, this trend may be an artifact of most studies having focused on systems in which parasites are large relative to their hosts. Yet, systems are common where parasites are small relative to their hosts, and these trophically transmitted parasites may be less likely to experience resource limitation. We looked for signs of density-dependence in Euhaplorchis californiensis (EUHA) and Renicola buchanani (RENB), two manipulative trematode parasites infecting wild-caught California killifish (Fundulus parvipinnis). These parasites are small relative to killifish (suggesting resources are not limiting), and are associated with changes in killifish behavior that are dependent on parasite-intensity and that increase predation rates by the parasites' shared final host (indicating the possibility for cost sharing). We did not observe negative density-dependence in either species, indicating that resources are not limiting. In fact, observed patterns indicate possible mild positive density-dependence for EUHA. Although experimental confirmation is required, our findings suggest that some behavior-manipulating parasites suffer no reduction in size, and may even benefit when crowded by conspecifics.","[Weinersmith, Kelly L.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Grad Grp Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Warinner, Chloe B.] Dos Pueblos High Sch, Goleta, CA 93117 USA; [Warinner, Chloe B.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tan, Virginia] Irvington High Sch, Fremont, CA 94538 USA; [Tan, Virginia] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Harris, David J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Populat Biol Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Mora, Adrienne B.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92507 USA; [Kuris, Armand M.; Lafferty, Kevin D.; Hechinger, Ryan F.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Kuris, Armand M.; Lafferty, Kevin D.; Hechinger, Ryan F.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Lafferty, Kevin D.] US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Weinersmith, KL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Grad Grp Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",KLSmit@UCDavis.edu,"Lafferty, Kevin D./B-3888-2009","Hechinger, Ryan/0000-0002-6633-253X",Division Of Integrative Organismal SystemsNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1338574] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,,,43,18,18,0,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1540-7063,1557-7023,,INTEGR COMP BIOL,Integr.

Contrary to other studies on this species, our results showed that amphipod females have the ability to adjust their offspring investment when conditions were significantly altered before mating in terms of food quantity, while food quality was of less importance. In fact, there was only a low beneficial effect on amphipod reproduction and embryonic development of a presumed high quality diatom diet. Also, the presence of a natural competitor did not affect amphipod reproductive outcome. The results are viewed in the context of a dramatic decline observed on the amphipod populations in the Gulf of Bothnia. Though, several plausible hypotheses have been suggested for the decline, including competition, new anthropogenic substances, hypoxia and predation, we hypothesize that the population decline is related to food shortage and malnutrition due to an increased percentage low quality terrestrial carbon (rich in humus) from river outflow into the Gulf of Bothnia. Concomitantly, the bacterial food web was enhanced, which has a lower trophic efficiency. We also suggest that a secondary effect of malnutrition is an increased susceptibility to other types of stressors such as contaminants and parasites. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

An optimal foraging model suggests that seed amounts remaining when foragers leave patches (giving-up-density, GUD) also provide quantitative measures of foraging economics, diet strategies and foraging abilities. Such quantitative uses of GUDs rest on several largely untested assumptions. We tested two of these with Merriam's kangaroo rats: that gain curves are smoothly decelerating, and that foragers leave patches at a constant harvest rate. Harvest rates indeed declined with patch residence time, but in the piecewise linear fashion expected of systematic search. Animals also revisited areas within patches less frequently than expected with random search. In the field, they depleted patches in multiple visits and did not use a constant-rate leaving rule. These deviations from model assumptions cast doubt on inferences about foraging ecology that have been based on quantitative GUD theory.","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Price, MV (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",mary.price@ucr.edu,,,,,,49,29,29,2,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Many mathematical models of malaria have been developed during the past century, and applied to potential interventions. However, malaria remains uncontrolled and is increasing in many areas, as are vector and parasite resistance to insecticides and drugs. Methods: This study presents a simulation model of African malaria vectors. This individual-based model incorporates current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying Anopheles population dynamics and their relations to the environment. One of its main strengths is that it is based on both biological and environmental variables. Results: The model made it possible to structure existing knowledge, assembled in a comprehensive review of the literature, and also pointed out important aspects of basic Anopheles biology about which knowledge is lacking. One simulation showed several patterns similar to those seen in the field, and made it possible to examine different analyses and hypotheses for these patterns; sensitivity analyses on temperature, moisture, predation and preliminary investigations of nutrient competition were also conducted. Conclusions: Although based on some mathematical formulae and parameters, this new tool has been developed in order to be as explicit as possible, transparent in use, close to reality and amenable to direct use by field workers. It allows a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying Anopheles population dynamics in general and also a better understanding of the dynamics in specific local geographic environments. It points out many important areas for new investigations that will be critical to effective, efficient, sustainable interventions.","NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Ctr Geog Med Res Coast, Kilifi, Kenya; Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol, Nairobi, Kenya; Ifakara Hlth Res & Dev Ctr, Ifakara, Kilombero Distr, Tanzania; IAEA, Agr & Biotechnol Lab, FAO, Entomol Unit, A-2444 Seibersdorf, Austria; Univ Miami, Global Publ Hlth Program, Miami, FL 33177 USA; Tulane Univ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; Univ Aberdeen, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland; Univ Natal, Sch Math Stat & IT, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; Malaria Res & Training Ctr, Fac Med Pharm & Dent, Bamako, Mali","Depinay, JMO (corresponding author), NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, 16 Ctr Dr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",depinayj@mail.nih.gov; cmbogo@kilifi.mimcom.net; gkilleen@ifakara.mimcom.net; B.Knols@iaea.org; JBeier@med.miami.edu; jcarlso@tulane.edu; dushoff@eno.princeton.edu; p.billingsley@abdn.ac.uk; MwambiH@nu.ac.za; jgithure@icipe.org; atoure@MRTCBKO.org; em225k@nih.gov,"Mwambi, Henry/A-2444-2013",,Intramural NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [Z99 TW999999] Funding Source: Medline,,,32,142,143,0,25,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1475-2875,,,MALARIA J,Malar.

In this study, we used the seeds of a bird-dispersed forest palm, Euterpe edulis, to investigate the effects of two distinct seed deposition patterns created by birds that defecate (clumped pattern) and regurgitate seeds (loose-clumped pattern) on the survival of seeds experimentally set in an E. edulis-rich site, and of seedlings grown under shade-house conditions. The study was conducted in the lowland forest of Parque Estadual Intervales, SE Brazil. Clumped and loose-clumped seeds were equally preyed upon by rodents and insects. Although clumped and isolated seedlings had the same root weight after 1 year, the isolated seedlings survived better and presented more developed shoots, suggesting intraspecific competition among clumped seedlings. Our results indicate that animals that deposit E. edulis seeds in faecal clumps (e.g. cracids, tapirs) are less efficient seed dispersers than those that regurgitate seeds individually (e.g. trogons, toucans). Intraspecific competition among seedlings growing from faecal clumps is a likely process preventing the occurrence of clumps of adult palms.

In this study we analysed under laboratory conditions aggressive behaviour in fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra, larvae. The aims of our study were: (1) to analyse the function of visual and movement displays in the context of agonistic behaviour; (2) to examine whether relative body size between individuals influences the frequency of aggressive interactions; and, (3) to determine the effect of larval density on the frequency of these aggressive interactions. The analysis of patterns that preceded a direct act of aggression (i.e. lunge or bite) revealed that the initiator of the contest exhibited more attacking patterns and that the receiver displayed more escape acts. Relative body size significantly affected the frequency of aggressive acts. The proportion of aggressive acts performed by the larger larva was positively related to relative larval body size. Density significantly affected the number of aggressive interactions observed. Significantly more aggressive acts were received or displayed by the focal larva at high density. Body size seems to be an important cue which is correlated with the outcome of aggressive interactions in Salamandra salamandra larvae. By visually assessing size asymmetry, individuals are able to use this difference to assess fighting ability, and can adjust their behaviour accordingly to avoid escalation of the aggressive encounter.","CSIC,MUSEO NACL CIENCIAS NAT,DEPT ECOL EVOLUT,E-28006 MADRID,SPAIN","Reques, R (corresponding author), UNIV CORDOBA,FAC CIENCIAS,DEPT BIOL ANIM,E-14071 CORDOBA,SPAIN.",,,,,,,31,23,25,0,9,BRITISH HERPETOL SOC,LONDON,"C/O ZOOL SOC LONDON REGENTS PARK, LONDON, ENGLAND NW1 4RY",0268-0130,,,HERPETOL J,Herpetolog.

Cost-benefit analyses revealed that average cone profitability (net energy gain per unit handling time [e/h]) was an increasing, but decelerating, function of cone size. Thus, we predicted that to maximize feeding efficiency squirrels should select patches that contain the highest densities of the largest cones. At one site, in which cone density was positively correlated with median cone size per tree, squirrels exhibited the predicted pattern of selection. Preferred trees contained more cones, larger cones and more viable seeds per cone than those trees sampled once by a squirrel and subsequently avoided. At a second site, there was a significant negative correlation between cone density and cone size and, as a result, squirrels were faced with a trade-off. Interestingly, at this site there were no discernible differences in any univariate measure of cone or patch quality (eg., the size, energy content or density of cones) between preferred and avoided trees. However, individual cone profitability and total seed mass of preferred trees were significantly higher, indicating that squirrels were not making patch choices on the basis of simple prey and patch characteristics, such as cone size and/or density. Moreover, these patch choices resulted in the highest short- and long-term rate of energy gain. We recommend that future field investigations on patch use consider interactions and possible trade-offs between diet and patch choices. Such an approach may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which animals make patch choices.","WAKE FOREST UNIV, DEPT BIOL, WINSTON SALEM, NC 27109 USA",,,,,,,,42,16,17,1,16,AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST,NOTRE DAME,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0003-0031,1938-4238,,AM MIDL NAT,Am.

The studied fossil material primarily included brachiopods and bivalves owing to their abundance throughout the section, but other subordinate taxonomic groups including ostracods and microgastropods were also integrated for discussion. Overall, a succession of three benthonic paleocommunities was recognized representing three connected ecological evolutionary stages across the Permian-Triassic transition. Both Stage 1 and Stage 2 paleocommunities predated the end-Permian boundary mass extinction, and were characterized by relatively high diversity of brachiopods and bivalves, with no or very rare other taxa. Approaching the end-Permian mass extinction and the PTB itself, the paleocommunity abruptly changed and was replaced by the Stage 2 paleocommunity that was characterized by a relatively low Shannon's diversity (H) coupled with a high Simpson's dominance index (D) and, most notably, a changeover from Neochonetes to Tethyochonetes (both are brachiopod genera) as the most significant ecological dominants. This Simpson's dominance index (D) shift correlates well with food shortage (i.e. much reduced terrestrial influx and acritarch abundance), and is therefore interpreted to signify, possibly, intensified interspecific competitions with Tethyochonetes seemingly outcompeting Neochonetes presumably due to its preadapted smaller body size. The post-extinction (Stage 3) paleocommunity is distinguished by a highly characteristic low-diversity and high-abundance fauna comprised mainly of lingulid brachiopods, Claraia bivalves, microgastropods and ostracods, suggesting a unique and highly stressful ecological regime. In this paleocommunity, Claraia might have acted like a disaster taxon and, as such, its ecological functional role in the paleocommunity was activated and elevated because of exceptional ecological conditions (e.g., anoxia, hyperthermal and/or severe food shortage). From the studied section, a number of ecological traits including species abundance distribution, Shannon's diversity (H), community dominance and body-size structure were identified as demonstrating significant changes accompanying community replacement prior to the end-Permian mass extinction. The fact that these changes preceded the mass extinction may suggest that these traits could represent some early warning signals for an impending ecological regime shift. This extended interpretation clearly has significant implications for modern ecological studies to predict future impending ecological regime shifts.","[Zhang, Yang] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, 29 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Shi, G.

The sidewinder and these rodents originated in the Mojave Desert and, thus, they share an evolutionary history. The Homed Viper originated in the Sahara and is an unknown and novel predator. Each snake poses a different risk for which the optimal strategy of the rodents will differ. The sidewinder belongs to a lineage that evolved heat sensing pits, allowing it to detect rodents on nights without ambient moon light, while the Homed Vipers lack this adaptation. We used Giving-up Densities as a measure of risk perception and compared their responses in relationship to microhabitat, moonlight, time and risk from other predators. Pocket mice feared both snakes and kangaroo rats acted in a relatively fearless manner. The differences between the rodents can be attributed to their snake-evasion adaptations. Kangaroo rats used their saltatorial agility which allows them to take risk while pocket mice climb out of harm's-way and enter torpor to reduce energetic costs when risk prevents foraging.","[Bleicher, Sonny S.] Washington & Lee Univ, Biol Dept, 204 W Washington St, Lexington, VA 24450 USA; [Bleicher, Sonny S.] George Mason Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Bleicher, Sonny S.; Kotler, Burt P.; Downs, Cynthia J.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel; [Bleicher, Sonny S.; Brown, Joel S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, 845 W Taylor St,MC 066, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Downs, Cynthia J.] Hamilton Coll, Dept Biol, Clinton, NY 13323 USA","Bleicher, SS (corresponding author), Washington & Lee Univ, Biol Dept, 204 W Washington St, Lexington, VA 24450 USA.",bleicher.s@gmail.com,"Bleicher, Sonny Shlomo/AAE-6272-2020","Bleicher, Sonny S/0000-0001-8727-5901",USA-Israel Binational Science FoundationUS-Israel Binational Science Foundation [BSF-2008163],"We especially thank Dr. Phil C.

In the present work, the results of the effectiveness of set-aside management to enhance soil nematode biodiversity and soil fertility are reported. In a mid-term experimental trial, three different set aside managements, with mowing in May or July and without mowing, were compared through conventional rotation to provide management indications in the context of Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) Standard 4.2 in fields located in three sites (North, Central and South Italy). Soil fertility was evaluated by determining available phosphorous, total organic carbon and carbon humification. Soil nematode diversity was explored by examining soil nematode community structure, assessing Maturity (MI), Plant Parasitic (PPI), Basal (BI), Enrichment (El), Structure (SI), Channel (CI) indices and diversity-weighted abundance. The results indicated that set-aside management moderately increased the available phosphorous and organic carbon content and humification remained low; the greatest increase in organic matter was obtained with mowing in May, period not permitted by Standard 4.2. The set-aside efficiency was associated with the previous crop rotations, and the major advantages were found after intensive crop rotations. In general, under set-aside management the nematode colonizer species, mainly bacterivores, increased in abundance and richness while plant parasitic nematodes and predators remained constant. Mowing carried out in July (the permitted period by Standard 4.2), weakly improved the soil nematode community structure by increasing k-strategies within nematode populations. Interestingly, the indices confirm that shifts in nematode community composition occurred more as a result of previous management than of five years of set-aside managements: specifically, the site characterized by the longest and the most conservative rotation, showed the highest values in MI, PPI, EI, SI indices. The use of diversity-weighted abundance expressed as biomass showed that free living nematodes involved in nutrient mineralization (bacterial and fungal feeders) and plant parasitic nematodes are not efficiently regulated by predation. Finally, as many nematode families are affected by soil organic carbon content, the low organic carbon increases found under set-aside management systems likely determined a low improvement of soil nematode biodiversity.","[Landi, Silvia; Rocchini, Andrea; Roversi, Pio Federico] Ctr Ric Difesa & Certificaz CREA DC, Consiglio Ric Agr & Analisi Econ Agr, Via Lanciola 12-A, I-50125 Florence, Italy; [Papini, Rossella; Brandi, Giorgio; Bazzoffi, Paolo; Mocali, Stefano] Ctr Ric Agr & Ambiente CREA AA, Consiglio Ric Agr & Analisi Econ Agr, Via Lanciola 12-A, I-50125 Florence, Italy; [d'Errico, Giada] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimertto Sci Agr, Via Univ 100, I-80055 Naples, Italy","Landi, S (corresponding author), Ctr Ric Difesa & Certificaz CREA DC, Consiglio Ric Agr & Analisi Econ Agr, Via Lanciola 12-A, I-50125 Florence, Italy.",silvia.landi@crea.gov.it,"Mocali, Stefano/ABE-2918-2020; Landi, Silvia/ABE-2994-2020; d'Errico, Giada/G-2419-2018","Landi, Silvia/0000-0002-1800-3248; Mocali, Stefano/0000-0002-1173-7206; d'Errico, Giada/0000-0002-1665-4805",Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali (MiPAAF),"Work done under the Project MO.NA.CO (national network for monitoring the environmental effectiveness of cross compliance and the differential of competitiveness charged against agricultural enterprises) funded by the Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali (MiPAAF) in the context of Action 1.2.2 Interregional Workshops for development of the Operational Programme called National Rural Network 2007-2013, Coord.

Ecologists have continuously modified Lotka-Volterra equations in order to provide more realistic descriptions of the complexity of these interactions. The response of predator(s) to increasing prey density can be best described in terms of a functional response, which is an important criterion determining the success or failure of predator(s) to control fluctuating prey populations. The functional response of a predator is further differentiated into Holling's Type I, II, III, IV and V. We discuss one-prey and one-predator interactions, in which the models are modified by the inclusion of steady-state satiation and growth factors. We review situations where two prey and one predator interact, and vice versa. We also discuss Holling's Type IV model relevant to competition and food chains. There is a need to examine functional responses as these models were mostly developed by pure mathematicians and their relevance to field conditions remains largely untested. Prey-predator interactions can be affected even by small factors and ecologists should include these models in their experimental design when attempting to predict realistic interactions.","[Pervez, Ahmad] Radhey Hari Govt PG Coll, Dept Zool, Biocontrol Lab, Udham Singh Nagar 244713, Uttarakhand, India; [Singh, Preet Pal] Govt PG Coll, Dept Math, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India; [Bozdogan, Hakan] Ahi Evran Univ, Vocat Sch Tech Sci, Dept Plant & Anim Prod, TR-40100 Kirsehir, Turkey","Pervez, A (corresponding author), Radhey Hari Govt PG Coll, Dept Zool, Biocontrol Lab, Udham Singh Nagar 244713, Uttarakhand, India.",ahmadpervez@yahoo.com,,,"SERB, Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi [EMR/2016/006296]","Authors thank to Dr. Barbara Castleton, ESL Instructor, South Seattle College, Seattle, Washington, USA for improving the English of this manuscript.

Here, we contrast the effect of commensalism and host-parasitoid interaction (complete fertility loss for infected host), on the concurrent evolution of host dispersal and habitat niche width. We assume that host habitat niche width is associated with a fertility trade-off; the wider the habitat niche, the lower the maximum fertility in optimal habitats. We implement a spatially explicit, individual-based one-host-one-guest metacommunity model (guest species are commensals or parasitoids) with landscape heterogeneity of a continuous habitat trait that affects the host's fertility only. The antagonistic interaction model follows the Nicholson-Bailey equation. Compared to commensalism, the host-parasitoid interaction promotes the evolution of higher dispersal probability in hosts and guests. In comparison to homogeneous landscapes, lower dispersal probabilities of both hosts and guests evolve in heterogeneous landscapes. Other than in homogeneous landscapes, parasitoids typically evolve higher dispersal probabilities than their hosts in heterogeneous landscapes. The effect of landscape heterogeneity on dispersal evolution depends on the magnitude of the habitat-fertility trade-off for hosts and the search efficiency of parasitoids. Moreover, depending on the habitat-fertility trade-off, antagonistic interactions may promote evolution of habitat niche width in hosts. Landscape structure affects the evolution of dispersal and habitat niche width in opposite ways: in clustered (autocorrelated) landscapes, dispersal probability evolves to higher, but habitat niche width to lower levels than in random landscapes.

Hence, fishless lakes containing freshwater communities that evolved without fish predation are commonly found on the Boreal Shield next to fish-present lakes. The aim of this study was thus to assess how different top-down control from fish or invertebrate predation structure zooplankton communities in eastern Canadian Boreal Shield lakes throughout the ice-free season. We examined zooplankton community characteristics using univariate indices such as abundance, richness (S), evenness (J'), diversity (H'), and multivariate species assemblages (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) in 5 lakes with a single fish population, brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, and in 5 naturally fishless lakes throughout the ice-free season. The total abundance of zooplanktonic organisms was significantly higher in fishless lakes over the whole sampling period; this was related to the presence of small herbivorous species such as rotifers. Species assemblages of zooplankton were also significantly different between the 2 types of lakes throughout the season, principally due to the high abundance of rotifers and the scarcity of immature and mature daphnids in fishless lakes. Our results suggest that the low intensity of selective predation by brook trout on large herbivores and the heavy predation by Chaoborus americanus larvae on daphnids in fishless lakes appear to be the key factors for structuring the zooplankton community. Multivariate indicators identified patterns that were not revealed with the usual univariate indices, showing the importance of selecting appropriate indicators for the assessment of community structure.","[Drouin, Annick; Sirois, Pascal] Univ Quebec Chicoutimi, Dept Sci Fondamentales, Lab Sci Aquat, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada; [Archambault, Philippe] Univ Quebec, Inst Sci Mer, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada","Sirois, P (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Chicoutimi, Dept Sci Fondamentales, Lab Sci Aquat, 555 Blvd Univ, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada.",pascal_sirois@uqac.ca,,,Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO university grant to Sirois and Archambault); Consortium de Recherche sur la Foret Boreale Commerciale; Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS); Fondation de la Faune du Quebec,"We would like to thank I.

Kelp itself provides overall structure to the habitat; however the rocky reef to which the kelp attaches is known to provide additional structure for cryptic species. Gymnothorax mordax, the California moray, is an elusive predatory species that is considered abundant in the waters around Catalina Island. However, no life history data exists for this species. We examined habitat composition, relative abundance, size pattern distributions, and biomass of G. mordax within Two Harbors, Catalina Island. Habitats were sampled using a combination of baited trap collection and transect surveys using SCUBA. A total of 462 G. mordax were captured, primarily in shallow (< 10 m) waters. Individuals of G. mordax were associated with mostly boulder and cobble substrates. Measurements of relative abundance and density indicate that G. mordax is more prevalent than reported in previous studies. We also discovered that the 6 trapping sites from which all morays were collected, differed in size structuring and density while the relatively high biomass did not change across sites. In general, southern facing sites exhibited higher densities of morays, while northern facing sites showed more size structuring. We show how the structural complexity of the rocky reef habitat in an already diverse kelp forest ecosystem, can support a high biomass of a cryptic elongate predatory fish.","[Higgins, B.

Group sizes in the field were within the range of female brood sizes and often occurred close to each other but did not merge. In captivity, juveniles formed groups immediately after birth. In laboratory experiments, they also associated significantly more with chambers containing familiar members of their own brood than empty chambers but did not associate more with chambers containing similar-sized juveniles from a different brood. Juvenile E. jacksoni also associated significantly more with chambers containing familiar brood-mates than with chambers containing unfamiliar members of a different brood. The strength of this preference increased with the number of days fish had been together since birth. When two broods were placed in a large outdoor tank, all individuals from both broods directed significantly more aggressive acts towards members of the other brood than towards members of their own brood. While the relative effects of familiarity and relatedness cannot be completely separated in this viviparous species, associating with familiar individuals would facilitate the maintenance of sibling groups in the field.

Physical conditions (e.g. depth, width, velocity) that vary with river discharge affect the performance (birth, growth, feeding, movement, or death rates) of organisms or trophic groups. Their performances in turn affect their impacts on food webs and ecosystems in channel and floodplain habitats. Here we explore the impact of floodplain width (modeled as 1X, 10X and 40X the channel width) on a food web with two energy sources (detritus and vegetation), invertebrates that consume these, a size structured fish population which consumes invertebrates and in which larger fish cannibalize small fish, and birds which feed on large fish. Hydraulic linkages to trophic dynamics are assumed to be mediated in three ways: birds feed efficiently only in shallow water; plant carrying capacity varies non-linearly with water velocity, and mobile and drifting organisms are diluted and concentrated with spillover of river discharge to the floodplain, and its reconfinement to the channel. Aspects of this model are based on field observations of Junk and Bailey from the Amazon, of Sparks from the Mississippi, and on our observations of the Fly River in Papua New Guinea. The model produced several counter-intuitive results, Biomass of invertebrates and fish increased with floodplain width, but much more rapidly from 1X to 10X floodplains than from 10X to 40X floodplains. For birds, maximum biomass occurred on the 10X floodplain. Initially high bird biomass on the 40X floodplain declined to extinction over time, because although favorable fishing conditions (shallow water) were most prolonged on the widest floodplain, this advantage was more than offset by the greater dilution of prey after spillover. Bird predation on large fish sometimes increased their biomass, by reducing cannibalism and thereby increasing the abundance of small fish available to grow into the larger size class. Sensitivity analyses indicated that model results were relatively robust to variation in parameter values that we chose, but much more exploration and calibration with field data are needed before we know how specific our results are to the structure and other assumptions of this model, We share with others the opinion that progress towards understanding complex dynamic systems like floodplain river ecosystems requires frequent feedback between modeling and field observations and experimentation. This understanding is crucial for river management and restoration. Organisms in real rivers have adapted to track and quickly exploit favorable conditions, and to avoid or endure adverse conditions. It is when we engineer away this environmental variability that we threaten the long term persistence of river-adapted biota.","UNIV MINNESOTA,ST ANTHONY FALLS HYDRAUL LAB,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55414; UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT GEOL & GEOPHYS,BERKELEY,CA 94720; UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT ZOOL,NJ-15,SEATTLE,WA 98195","POWER, ME (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL,BERKELEY,CA 94720, USA.",,,,,,,44,42,42,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-555X,,,GEOMORPHOLOGY,Geomorphology,SEP,1995,13,1-4,,,,,301,317,,10.1016/0169-555X(95)00039-8,,,17,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Physical Geography; Geology,RW295,WOS:A1995RW29500020,,,,,2021-09-27,

Oligotrophic lakes are generally dominated by calanoid copepods because of their competitive advantage over cladocerans at low prey densities. Planktivory also can alter zooplankton community structure. We sought to understand the role of planktivory in driving recent changes to the zooplankton community of Lake Huron, a large oligotrophic lake on the border of Canada and the United States. We tested the hypothesis that excessive predation by fish (rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax, bloater Coregonus hoyi) and invertebrates (Mysis relicta, Bythotrephes longimanus) had driven observed declines in cladoceran and cyclopoid copepod biomass between 2002 and 2007. 2. We used a field sampling and bioenergetics modelling approach to generate estimates of daily consumption by planktivores at two 91-m depth sites in northern Lake Huron, U. S. A., for each month, May-October 2007. Daily consumption was compared to daily zooplankton production. 3. Bythotrephes was the dominant planktivore and estimated to have eaten 78% of all zooplankton consumed. Bythotrephes consumption exceeded total zooplankton production between July and October. Mysis consumed 19% of all the zooplankton consumed and exceeded zooplankton production in October. Consumption by fish was relatively unimportant - eating only 3% of all zooplankton consumed. 4. Because Bythotrephes was so important, we explored other consumption estimation methods that predict lower Bythotrephes consumption. Under this scenario, Mysis was the most important planktivore, and Bythotrephes consumption exceeded zooplankton production only in August. 5. Our results provide no support for the hypothesis that excessive fish consumption directly contributed to the decline of cladocerans and cyclopoid copepods in Lake Huron. Rather, they highlight the importance of invertebrate planktivores in structuring zooplankton communities, especially for those foods webs that have both Bythotrephes and Mysis. Together, these species occupy the epi-, meta- and hypolimnion, leaving limited refuge for zooplankton prey.","[Bunnell, David B.; Davis, Bruce M.; Warner, David M.; Chriscinske, Margret A.; Roseman, Edward F.] USGS Great Lakes Sci Ctr, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA","Bunnell, DB (corresponding author), USGS Great Lakes Sci Ctr, 1451 Green Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA.",dbunnell@usgs.gov,,"Bunnell, David/0000-0003-3521-7747; Roseman, Edward/0000-0002-5315-9838",U.S. EPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [DW-14-94816701-0],"We gratefully acknowledge the efforts of the R/V Sturgeon crew: Mike McCann, Phil Pepper, and Mark Brown.

The authors studied a tritrophic system composed of a plant, its pollinating seed predator, and a parasitoid of the latter. Their concern was whether the parasitoid modifies the interaction between the plant and its pollinator-herbivore along the mutualism-antagonism gradient, but they reduced their question to how the parasitoid impacts plant fitness. After showing that the parasitoid increases seed output of the plant by decreasing the amount of seeds consumed by the pollinating seed predator, they tested whether seed output is a good proxy for plant fitness. They argue that it is not by showing that the increased seed density has a negative impact on survival probability and flower production, likely due to plant intraspecific competition. The work presented shows careful experimentation and interesting results, but we do not share some of their conclusions. Most importantly, we believe that the net effect of the parasitoid on the plant-herbivore interaction cannot be adequately investigated by focusing on individual plant fitness. Thus, we first suggest considering the number of surviving plants up to adulthood as a proxy for population performance to address this question. Using this proxy, we show that the increase in seed output due to the parasitoid is beneficial to the plant population until its carrying capacity is achieved. Next, using a population dynamics model, we show under which particular conditions the negative effect of intraspecific competition outweighs the positive effect of seed density increase (due to parasitoid's defense). When these conditions do not hold, the role of plant intraspecific competition is basically limited to the prevention of unbounded population growth, while the parasitoid increases the plant's equilibrium density above its carrying capacity as measured when interacting only with the pollinating seed predator, thus making the system more stable.","[Gutierrez, Nicolas M.; Stucchi, Luciano] Univ Pacifico, Lima, Peru; [Gutierrez, Nicolas M.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Ciencias, Lima, Peru; [Galeano, Javier] Univ Politecn Madrid, Grp Sistemas Complejos, Madrid, Spain; [Gimenez-Benavides, Luis] Univ Rey Juan Carlos ESCET, Dept Biol Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, Madrid 28933, Spain","Gimenez-Benavides, L (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos ESCET, Dept Biol Geol Fis & Quim Inorgan, Madrid 28933, Spain.",luis.gimenez@urjc.es,"Gimenez-Benavides, Luis/A-3751-2009","Gimenez-Benavides, Luis/0000-0001-6319-1180; Stucchi, Luciano/0000-0002-2823-0778",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,,8,0,0,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Therefore, any change in the behavior of the predator should result in changes to the behavior of the prey. However, this key prediction has rarely been tested. To examine the effects of the predator state on prey behavior, we manipulated the state of captive Barn Owls, Tyto alba, and released them into an enclosure containing Allenby's gerbils, Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi, a common prey of the owls. The owls were significantly more active when hungry. In response, the gerbils altered their behavior according to the state of the owl. When the owl was hungry, the gerbils visited fewer food patches, foraged in fewer patches, and harvested less food from each patch. Moreover, the gerbils kept their foraging bouts closer to their burrow, which reduced the overlap among foraging ranges of individual gerbils. Thus, changes in the state of the predator affect the foraging behavior of its prey and can also mediate competition among prey individuals.","[Berger-Tal, Oded; Kotler, Burt P.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel","Berger-Tal, O (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.",bergerod@bgu.ac.il,"Berger-Tal, Oded/P-1670-2019; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012; Berger-Tal, Oded/P-9189-2014","Berger-Tal, Oded/0000-0002-7396-456X; Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; Berger-Tal, Oded/0000-0002-7396-456X",Mitrani Department of Desert Ecology,We thank Ron Elazari-Volcani from the Zoological Gardens of the Tel-Aviv University for lending LIS the owls for this research.

Many ecologists have proposed that changes in the intensity of recruitment of individuals into a community should influence community structure. Past work investigating this hypothesis has primarily been surveys of recruitment and community structure across large spatial scales. Surprisingly, no researchers to date have manipulated recruitment into a rocky intertidal community to assess the response of interactions of the whole community to variation in recruitment intensity. We manipulated the densities of Balanus glandula and Chthamalus spp. recruits across a four-fold difference at two sites spanning the Monterey Bay, California, USA, to experimentally test if differences in recruitment intensity influenced initial changes in community composition and if these changes persisted through time. The results of this work indicate that differences in recruitment influence community composition initially, but that these changes can be short-lived. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The Jonah crab, Cancer borealis (Stimpson), was chosen as the interspecific competitor because it shares resources with C. irroratus. Four treatments were tested for their effect on foraging: the presence or absence of a competitor and two types of prey odor; body odor (living mussel) and tissue extract (dead mussel tissue). The presence of Jonah crabs did not influence location time, search time, prey size selected, or handling time of the rock crabs. However, rock crabs responded differently to the presence of body odor and tissue extract cues. The presence of extract odor decreased the time to locate prey while increasing the number of prey manipulated and prey size selected. When prey body odor was present, rock crabs displayed less investigative behaviors than in the presence of extract odor, illustrated by reduced location time. Extract odor provided a stronger and more attractive cue than body odor, but increased prey manipulation and search time. Extract odor induced increases in manipulation and searching for prey but canceled out the benefits of decreased location time, resulting in crabs from both treatments displaying similar search times. These elevated behaviors may be associated with foraging for injured and cracked prey or may indicate an area of conspecific feeding. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Feeding bowls, containing a 1-L sand/seed mixture, were placed at three distances from cover. Control treatments (equal seed densities at each bowl) were compared with experimental treatments (higher seed densities farther from cover). More birds fed farther from cover when associated food return was higher, but age-classes responded differently to treatments. On average, dominant adults fed closer to cover than subordinate immatures, even when higher reward was available farther from cover. As predicted if risk of social interaction influences the food return-predation risk trade-off: (1) immatures switched their feeding location more readily than adults and (2) when the reward differential among bowls was especially large, adults shifted to feed farther from cover, and displaced immatures towards the bowl closer to cover. White-crowned Sparrows traded-off food return against predation risk, and this trade-off was influenced by the risk of social interaction such that subordinates were willing to risk higher predation if the risk of social interaction was thereby reduced.","UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT BIOL SCI, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA",,,"Slotow, Rob/AAM-9053-2020; Paxinos, Ellen/AAG-2907-2019","Paxinos, Ellen/0000-0002-1710-8064; Slotow, Rob/0000-0001-9469-1508",,,,26,22,24,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0010-5422,1938-5129,,CONDOR,Condor,AUG,1997,99,3,,,,,642,650,,10.2307/1370476,,,9,Ornithology,Zoology,XQ301,WOS:A1997XQ30100007,,,,,2021-09-27,

The dominant snail, Lymnaea elodes, increased on the fertilized side of the lake. Another snail, Valvata lewisi, previously shown to be competitively inferior to Lymnaea, did not increase in the fertilized sector until the fifth year of the study, but then increased dramatically. Chironomids were more abundant and had higher biomass on the reference side of the lake, an initial condition, and did not increase in the fertilized sector. Slimy sculpin, previously shown to control chironomids on bare sediments in nearby Toolik Lake, were the only fish predators on chironomids in Lake N-2; they did not grow faster in the fertilized sector. These results suggest that the dominant benthic invertebrates in N-2, chironomids and snails, were limited by different factors; chironomids were not food limited and appeared to be limited by predators, but snails, free from predation in N-2, appeared food limited. The planktonic model of cascading trophic interactions, if applied to benthic communities, would predict that, at low (zero) piscivore density, sculpin density and/or growth would increase as increased primary productivity was passed up the food web; they did not. The physical structure of the benthic zone is such that edible food can accumulate, whereas this cannot occur over extended time scales in planktonic systems.

The impact of a suite of coccinellid and syrphid predators emerged as the predominant factor affecting the success of aphid colonies: colonies protected from natural enemies grew in size at a rate of ten percent per day, were only one tenth as likely to go extinct, and produced over ten times more dispersing alates. In contrast, I found only minor effects of removing flea beetles, the most abundant herbivore with which A. varians colonies cohabit fireweed stems, and of supplementing water availability to fireweed host plants, in spite of a significant effect of watering frequency on aphid growth in the greenhouse. There was no evidence of significant two- or three-way interactions among factors. Hence, despite the potential complexity of the food web in which it is embedded, the dynamics of A. varians appears to be driven predominantly by a single factor, i.e. interactions with natural enemies.","UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT ZOOL,SEATTLE,WA 98195",,,,,,,,48,23,24,0,15,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1992,90,3,,,,,359,365,,10.1007/BF00317692,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HW294,WOS:A1992HW29400007,28313522,,,,2021-09-27,

Field experiments employing predator and herbivore manipulations and prey transplants suggested top-down (predation, grazing) processes varied positively with bottom-up processes (growth of filter-feeders, prey recruitment), but the basis for these differences was unknown. Shore-based sampling revealed that between-site differences were associated with nearshore oceanographic conditions, including phytoplankton concentration and productivity, particulates, and water temperature during upwelling, Further, samples taken at 19 sites along 380 lan of coastline suggested that the differences documented between two sites reflect broader scale gradients of phytoplankton concentration, Among several alternative explanations, a coastal hydrodynamics hypothesis, reflecting mesoscale (tens to hundreds of kilometers) variation in the interaction between offshore currents and winds and continental shelf bathymetry, was inferred to be the primary underlying cause, Satellite imagery and offshore chlorophyll-a samples are consistent with the postulated mechanism.

Species, sex, or age classes may use different niches to reduce competition for food, which may be enforced by social dominance or may lead to ecological specialization. An alternate hypothesis is that individuals using resource patches that renew over time intentionally avoid recently depleted patches by avoiding each other. We tested these hypotheses by simultaneously radio-tracking northern flicker (Colaptes auratus) mates. Members of a pair rarely foraged in the same patch, spending over 90 % of the time > 50 m apart. Counter to the ecological specialization hypothesis, the types of ground cover used for foraging and the distance of foraging patches from cover and edge did not differ between males and females. Mates were more spatially segregated on the home range than random and males foraged closer to the nest than females, but we never saw agonistic behaviors counter to the dominance hypothesis. Both sexes avoided returning to the same foraging location repeatedly, perhaps because of prey depletion. We suggest that members of a pair avoided foraging close to each other to reduce encounters with depleted prey patches. We emphasize the importance of simultaneous tracking of mates to identify foraging strategies and potential niche segregation at the home range scale.","[Gow, Elizabeth A.; Wiebe, Karen L.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada","Gow, EA (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, 112 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada.",eliz.gow@usask.ca,,,Kenneth Molson Foundation; National Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC Canada Graduate ScholarshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Society of Canadian Ornithologists; Isabel Maria Lopez Matinez Memorial Scholarship,"We thank J.

This diet similarity leads to the expectation that the growth rates of co-occurring largemouth bass and smallmouth bass should covary positively. However, the relative abundance of the two species varies widely among lakes, suggesting that there are important ecological differences and making it difficult to predict how the individual growth rates of the two species will covary among systems. We quantified the diets and growth rates of largemouth bass and smallmouth bass in a set of lakes in New York State that varied in the relative abundance of the two species. Despite changing diets as a function of size, largemouth bass and smallmouth bass consumed similar prey across the size range. As expected based on diets, the growth rates of the two species were also positively correlated among lakes for most size-classes. However, the growth rates of small, invertebrate-feeding fish were negatively correlated with those of larger fish that fed on fish and crayfish. These results suggest that largemouth bass and smallmouth bass growth rates respond similarly across environmental gradients but that both species are composed of ecologically distinct stages.","Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources, Bridgeport, NY 13030 USA; Cornell Univ, Cornell Biol Field Stn, Bridgeport, NY 13030 USA","Olson, MH (corresponding author), Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Biol, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA.",mark.olson@fandm.edu,,,,,,23,30,31,1,29,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"325 CHESTNUT ST, SUITE 800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0002-8487,,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

In the Salt River, in western Kentucky, U. S. A., pulmonates were fairly common in headwater streams, and were replaced in larger order tributaries by prosobranch snails. The literature suggests that pulmonates have tolerance and capacity adaptations to variation in physicochemical variables like temperature or dissolved oxygen. Only one of the two pulmonates tested in the laboratory, however, had quicker righting responses and rates of movement, important in recolonizing ephemeral habitats. A competition experiment in an artificial stream indicated that the large-river prosobranch, Lithasia obovata (Say, 1829), suffered less reduction in growth than the pulmonate Helisoma trivolvis (Say, 1817). Both the literature and experiments we have performed suggest that prosobranchs are less vulnerable to predators. We interpret these results to suggest pulmonates are more common in temporary headwater streams, or shallow littoral margins of lotic systems, because of greater physiological adaptation, while prosobranchs are more common in larger rivers (or in spring-fed rivers) because of greater competitive ability, lower risk of predation, or less-variable physicochemical regimes.","Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Brown, KM (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",,,,,,,71,42,44,0,22,AMER MALACOLOGICAL UNION,WILMINGTON,"DELAWARE MUSEUM NATURAL HISTORY, BOX 3937, WILMINGTON, DE 19807-0937 USA",0740-2783,,,AM MALACOL BULL,Am.

Compared with rivers in more humid, forested ecoregions of eastern and midwestern U.S.A., rivers in semi-arid grassland of the U.S. Great Plains tend to be relatively shallow, more variable in discharge, and characterised by high suspended sediment loads. Although critical life stages of fish in prairie rivers probably depend at least partially on zooplanktonic food, data on community and distributional patterns of potamoplankton in these widespread ecosystems are almost entirely absent. 2. We examined summer zooplankton distribution in five prairie rivers (Arkansas, Kansas, Platte, Elkhorn, and Niobrara Rivers) spread over six degrees of latitude during 2003-2004. We compared our results from 126 samples with previously collected data from the Ohio and St Lawrence Rivers in forested ecoregions and correlated differences with abiotic environmental conditions. 3. The importance of hydrological retention zones to stream biota has been recently demonstrated for rivers with quasi-permanent islands and slackwater regions, but the importance of slackwaters formed by ephemeral sandbar islands in prairie rivers is unknown. We evaluated the role of hydrological retention for planktonic rotifers, cladocera, and copepods in the Kansas River during the summer of 2004. 4. Zooplankton assemblages were extremely similar among prairie rivers (Sorensen Dissimilarity Index: mean = 0.07) but moderately disparate for comparisons of prairie versus forested-basin rivers (mean = 0.50). 5. Total zooplankton densities in prairie rivers (approximately 81 L-1) were intermediate between the Ohio (approximately 92 L-1) and St Lawrence Rivers (approximately 43 L-1), but relative abundances were significantly different. Rotifers represented > 99% of zooplankton individuals in grassland rivers, but only approximately 37-68% in other rivers. Rotifer species richness was lower in prairie rivers, but relative abundances of common genera were much less skewed compared with eastern rivers where Polyarthra dominated rotifer assemblages (41-73%). 6. For comparisons among rivers, rotifers were significantly more abundant in turbid rivers, while microcrustaceans were less dense. However, for comparisons within the Kansas River over time, rotifer densities were inversely related to turbidity. We hypothesise that rotifers indirectly benefit from river turbidity because their food competitors (cladocera) and predators (e.g. cyclopoid copepods and visually feeding fish) are relatively more susceptible to suspended sediments. 7. Crustacean densities were positively related to the degree of hydrological retention (negatively to current velocities) throughout the study, but rotifer densities were significantly depressed by current velocities only when river discharge was high, making slackwaters that much more valuable. Ephemeral sandbars may not provide sufficient hydrological retention in time and space to sustain viable crustacean populations, but they are adequate to help sustain growth of rotifer populations.","Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Survey, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Lawrence, KS USA; Univ Ferrara, Dept Biol, Ferrara, Italy","Thorp, JH (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Survey, 2101 Constant Ave, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA.",thorp@ku.edu,,,,,,40,55,70,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Communication via bioluminescent signals in synchronous fireflies is a promising model to test hypotheses regarding differences between males and females in the effect of the size of signal emission and detection organs on fitness components. Synchronous firefly species congregate in large numbers during the mating season, displaying bioluminescent signals aimed at potential mates during relatively short nightly periods. Operational sex ratios are male-biased and, thus, the so-called typical sex roles (indiscriminate males and choosy females) are expected to evolve. We studied the synchronous firefly Photinus palaciosi, a species that during the mating season congregates in forests of central Mexico offering a magnificent natural show that attracts numerous tourists. P. palaciosi females have reduced wings (brachyptery) and cannot fly. Our field study tested the hypothesis that the male-biased operational sex ratio and the short daily mating period result in strong male-male competition that selects for males with larger lanterns and larger eyes, and against male mate choice, whereas female-female mate competition is absent and, thus, no selection on lantern or eye size is expected. Even though lantern, eye or body size do not predict the probability of being found in copula for either sex, sexual dimorphism in these features, along with allometric slopes of lantern size and assortative mating in terms of relative lantern size, support not only the hypothesis of intense sexual selection among males, but the possibility of subtle mechanisms of sexual selection among females. Trade-offs between investment in signaling (lanterns) versus detection (eyes) structures, or with pressures different from sexual selection such as those imposed by predators, are also likely to be important in shaping the evolution of sexual signaling in these fireflies.","[Lopez-Palafox, Tania] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Posgrad Ciencias Biomed, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Macias-Ordonez, Rogelio] Inst Ecol AC, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico; [Cordero, Carlos R.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Evolut, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","Cordero, CR (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Evolut, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",cordero@ecologia.unam.mx,"Macias-Ordonez, Rogelio/AAO-3447-2020; Macias-Ordonez, Rogelio/E-8286-2010","Macias-Ordonez, Rogelio/0000-0003-1101-6289; Cordero, Carlos/0000-0001-7233-4382",PAPIIT/UNAMPrograma de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [IN219818]; CONACYT (Mexico) ScholarshipConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); program PAEP of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"This research was supported by a grant from PAPIIT/UNAM (IN219818) to Carlos Cordero.

In marine ecosystems, segregation in feeding habits has been largely described as a common mechanism to allow the coexistence of several competing marine predators. However, little is known about the feeding ecology of most species of chondrichthyans, which play a pivotal role in the structure of marine food webs worldwide. In this study, we examined the trophic ecology of 3 relatively abundant chondrichthyans coexisting in the Mediterranean Sea: the blackmouth catshark Galeus melastomus, the velvet belly lanternshark Etmopterus spinax and the rabbit fish Chimaera monstrosa. To examine their trophic ecology and interspecific differences in food habits, we combined the analysis of stomach content and stable isotopes. Our results highlighted a trophic segregation between C. monstrosa and the other 2 species. G. melastomus showed a diet composed mainly of cephalopods, while E. spinax preyed mainly on shrimps and C. monstrosa on crabs. Interspecific differences in the trophic niche were likely due to different feeding capabilities and body size. Each species showed different isotopic niche space and trophic level. Specifically, C. monstrosa showed a higher trophic level than E. spinax and G. melastomus. The high trophic levels of the 3 species highlighted their important role as predators in the marine food web. Our results illustrate the utility of using complementary approaches that provide information about the feeding behaviour at short (stomach content) and long-term scales (stable isotopes), which could allow more efficient monitoring of marine food-web changes in the study area.","[Albo-Puigserver, Marta; Navarro, Joan; Coll, Marta; Aguzzi, Jacopo; Saez-Liante, Raquel] CSIC, ICM, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Navarro, Joan] CSIC, EBD, Dept Conservat Biol, Seville 41092, Spain; [Coll, Marta] IRD IFREMER UM2, Lab Ecosyst Marins Exploites, UMR 212, F-34203 Sete, France; [Cardona, Luis] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Anim, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Cardona, Luis] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Albo-Puigserver, M (corresponding author), CSIC, ICM, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",albo@icm.csic.es,"Cardona, Luis/L-1680-2014; Navarro, Joan/C-2119-2009; Puigserver, Marta Albo/F-5693-2016; Puigserver, Marta Albo/AAP-5800-2020; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/AAB-1161-2019; Cardona, Luis/AAL-1354-2021; Coll, Marta/A-9488-2012","Cardona, Luis/0000-0002-7892-1323; Navarro, Joan/0000-0002-5756-9543; Puigserver, Marta Albo/0000-0002-0477-5984; Puigserver, Marta Albo/0000-0002-0477-5984; Cardona, Luis/0000-0002-7892-1323; Coll, Marta/0000-0001-6235-5868",FPI program (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness); Marie Curie GIC project BioWeb; Ramon y Cajal Program (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competiveness); BioWeb project,"We thank Isabel Palomera for her en couragement and support and fishermen from Port de la Selva and Llanca for helping with sample collection.

In the yellow-crowned bishop, the earliest branching lineage of the genus, an experimentally introduced red color patch gave a competitive advantage over yellow. This indicates agonistic sexual selection for red also in bishops, and that a receiver bias predated the evolution of red coloration in the genus.Preexisting receiver biases are well known and empirically supported alternatives or complements to signal evolution through coevolving mate choice, but largely neglected as drivers of sexually or socially selected agonistic signal evolution. In further pursuit of a recently revealed receiver bias for red agonistic signaling in Euplectes (17 species of widowbirds and bishops), we investigate here its presence in the yellow-crowned bishop (Euplectes afer), a representative of the earliest phylogenetic branch of the genus. In a captive population in southern Spain, where the yellow-crowned bishop is invasive, we staged and filmed 10-min dyadic contests over access to a feeder, between males with experimentally yellow- (control-) and red-painted crown plumage, respectively. Red males secured significantly more time at the feeder, and tended to win more of the limited number of supplant attempts observed. This suggests that the previously demonstrated agonistic signal function of red carotenoid coloration in widowbirds also applies to the bishop birds, and may derive from a receiver bias (aversion) that is substantially older than the convergent gains of red plumage pigmentation in Euplectes, and perhaps also predating the evolution of red in a few other weaverbird (Ploceidae) lineages. Given the similarities in ecology and behavior across Euplectes, the color diversity appears to primarily be a consequence of evolutionary limitations on mechanisms for achieving red coloration.","[Ninnes, Calum E.; Adrion, Marius; Andersson, Staffan] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Edelaar, Pim] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem Engn, Seville 41013, Spain; [Edelaar, Pim; Tella, Jose L.] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, Seville 41092, Spain","Ninnes, CE (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Box 463, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",calum.ninnes@gmail.com,"Ninnes, Calum/J-6448-2016; Edelaar, Pim/P-5650-2014; Andersson, Staffan/B-1534-2010","Ninnes, Calum/0000-0002-3733-9337; Edelaar, Pim/0000-0003-4649-6366; Andersson, Staffan/0000-0003-1474-3596","Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission; Swedish Academy of Sciences; Helge Ax:son Johnsons Stiftelse; Wilhelm and Martina Lundgrens Vetenskapsfond; Lars Hiertas Minne Stiftelsen; Adlerbertska Stipendiestiftelsen; University of Gothenburg; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [RYC-2011-07889, CGL2012-35232]; European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission","This work was supported by Swedish Research Council (to S.A.), Swedish Academy of Sciences (K.V.A.), Helge Ax:son Johnsons Stiftelse, Wilhelm and Martina Lundgrens Vetenskapsfond, Lars Hiertas Minne Stiftelsen, Adlerbertska Stipendiestiftelsen, the University of Gothenburg (to C.E.N.), and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (RYC-2011-07889 and CGL2012-35232) with support from the European Regional Development Fund (to P.E.).",,41,7,7,0,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

In particular, these grasslands serve as biodiversity repositories for a myriad of imperilled animal species. One such group is grassland birds, which have experienced significant declines, predominantly caused by extensive loss and degradation of native grasslands. Rangeland management that promotes increasing and sustaining livestock production through reducing the inherent, disturbance-driven variability that historically occurred in grasslands is considered a major contributing factor to these declines. An alternative approach to this homogeneous management paradigm attempts to restore a shifting mosaic of disturbance patches across the landscape through the spatial and temporal interactions of fire and grazing (i.e. pyric herbivory). Application of pyric herbivory through patch-burn grazing increases overall habitat heterogeneity, likely a critically important factor in maintaining and enhancing grassland bird populations. We compared reproductive rates and estimates of fecundity of three grassland birds nesting in grasslands maintained by traditional and patch-burn grazing management paradigms in the Southern Great Plains of North America. Additionally, we used a sensitivity analysis approach to assess population stability (i.e. =1) and source-sink population dynamics under the two management practices. Nest survival for dickcissels Spiza americana and grasshopper sparrows Ammodramus savannarum was higher in patch-burned grasslands than in traditionally managed grasslands, while nest survival for eastern meadowlarks Sturnella magna was higher in traditionally managed grasslands than in patch-burned grasslands. Dickcissels and grasshopper sparrows responded positively to patch burning with source habitats occurring over a wider range of survival rates under patch burning than traditional management, while no clear pattern emerged in source-sink dynamics of eastern meadowlarks.Synthesis and applications. Management strategies such as patch-burn grazing offer opportunities to restore landscape heterogeneity to benefit bird communities while maintaining livestock production goals. Applying patch-burn grazing to rangelands can increase productivity of grassland birds and could be effective for reversing the decline of grassland birds by providing source habitats more consistently than traditional rangeland management. Our results emphasize the utility of using sensitivity analyses to determine source-sink population dynamics when evaluating management practices. However, land managers should consider that source-sink models have shortcomings and designation of a habitat as a sink does not necessarily mean the habitat has low conservation value.","[Davis, Craig A.; Fuhlendorf, Samuel D.; Engle, David M.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Churchwell, Roy T.] Univ Alaska, Dept Biol & Wildlife, 101 Murie, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Hovick, Torre J.] North Dakota State Univ, Sch Nat Resource Sci, 106 Walster Hall, Fargo, ND 58108 USA","Davis, CA (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",craig.a.davis@okstate.edu,"Fuhlendorf, Samuel/A-2931-2011","Fuhlendorf, Samuel/0000-0002-8726-9402",U.S. Department of Agriculture through National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program [2003-35101-12928]; Nebraska Chapter of The Nature Conservancy; Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station,"We thank the U.S. Department of Agriculture for providing funding for this project through their National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program, grant number 2003-35101-12928.

We tested the existence of a trophic cascade involving omnivorous crayfish (Orconectes rusticus), macroinvertebrates, periphyton, and macrophytes using 9-m(2) cages in the littoral zone of Plum Lake, Wisconsin, USA. Treatments in the replicated (N = 4) experiment were crayfish enclosures, crayfish exclosures, and cageless references. During June-September, we measured macrophyte shoot numbers, macroinvertebrate numbers, and periphyton (on plastic strips) chlorophyll a, and dry mass (DM). We expected that crayfish foraging would directly reduce abundance and change species composition of macrophytes and macroinvertebrates and would indirectly enhance periphyton abundance by reducing the abundance of grazing snails. In enclosures, macrophyte and snail (but not nonsnail macroinvertebrate) densities declined significantly throughout the experiment, whereas densities of macrophytes, snails, and nonsnail macroinvertebrates increased in exclosures and cageless references. Some of the reduction in macrophytes resulted from nonconsumptive fragmentation of macrophytes by crayfish. Consistent with the cascading trophic interactions model, periphyton chlorophyll a per unit surface area increased in enclosures, but declined in exclosures. Periphyton quality (as indexed by chlorophyll a/DM) also increased in enclosures relative to exclosures and cageless references. However, because of large reductions in macrophyte surface area (which periphyton colonizes) in enclosures, total amount of periphyton chlorophyll a in enclosures (relative to exclosures) probably declined while periphyton quantity per unit surface area and periphyton quality increased. Thus, the impacts of crayfish omnivory on periphyton, expressed in two conflicting indirect effects, confirm the possibility that omnivory can complicate cascading trophic predictions. Overall, results support the existence of strong trophic interactions in the littoral zone, in which omnivorous crayfish control abundance of macrophytes, snails, and periphyton.","UNIV OKLAHOMA,DEPT ZOOL,NORMAN,OK 73019","LODGE, DM (corresponding author), UNIV NOTRE DAME,DEPT BIOL SCI,NOTRE DAME,IN 46556, USA.",,"Lodge, David Michael/AAX-1781-2021; Langerhans, R.

We filmed 56 large adult male lizards during the active spring reproductive period and detected substantial divergence in display behavior between populations. We found that (1) relative dewlap areas did not differ significantly between populations, (2) Tulane anoles spent about twice as much time displaying compared with Good Hope field anoles, although the average display duration did not differ significantly between populations, and (3) the two populations differed significantly in the relative frequency of display types: lizards from the Tulane population used a higher proportion of A and B display types, whereas Good Hope Field anoles used C displays more often.

Five sets had two parallel strings of five opposing shelters and an additional linear string set 2 to apart without opposing shelters was the most widely separated treatment. Shelters spaced I m apart and closer had higher lobster population densities, more intraspecific competition and higher proportions of empty shelters. Surprisingly, lobsters there were also significantly smaller, declining from 62.7 mm to 50.9 on the carapace (CL) for 2 to linear to 0.25 m spaced shelters, respectively. Nearly all 932 lobsters measured in this study were juvenile (< 90 mm CL) and preharvestable (< 83 mm CL) sized, so mate selection and fishing effects were unlikely. At the scale of the experiment, larger lobsters leave or avoid areas of high lobster population density and intense competition for areas of low population density and relaxed competition (called demographic diffusion). Scuba surveys in coastal zones found lobster population densities scale with shelter densities and were highest in boulder habitat where, like the experiment, more than half the shelters were vacant. Fisheries independent scuba and trawl surveys in Maine's shallow coastal zone repeatedly recorded declines of preharvestable, lobsters larger than 60 turn CL in size and increases of those sizes offshore and in deep water. It is possible that this demographic diffusion is driven by behaviors associated with intraspecific shelter competition.","Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Walpole, ME 04573 USA","Steneck, RS (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, 193 Clarks Cove Rd, Walpole, ME 04573 USA.",Steneck@maine.edu,,,,,,42,35,39,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0278-0372,1937-240X,,J CRUSTACEAN BIOL,J.

However, stochastic factors, coupled with intrinsic biotic factors, such as herbivory or predation, can cause communities within the same habitat to become highly dissimilar in composition. Much research on the succession of terrestrial systems has been conducted, but factors influencing the succession of a terrestrial system may not apply to aquatic systems. To determine whether succession in an aquatic system is deterministic or dominated by contingency of stochastic factors, and the role that higher trophic level interactions and resources have in shaping successional patterns, I followed community development and dynamics of the intermediate and bottom trophic level (protozoans and bacteria) in the model Sarracenia purpurea pitcher plant system throughout an entire growing season. By comparing these dynamics across pitcher plant leaves within the same bog, I was able to determine whether there is a predictable pattern for community assembly in this aquatic community. The results from this study suggest that rather than a sequential replacement of early colonizers with more competitive species through time, competitively superior species establish in newly formed communities simultaneously with less competitive species, which coexist throughout the growing season. Community assembly in this system can also be altered by stochastic events. Resources and predators had a variable effect on the patterns of community change observed during succession. Patterns of community assembly were also dependent on the trophic level examined but, for the bottom trophic level, not on the sampling method used.","[Gray, Sarah M.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Gray, SM (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol, Unit Ecol & Evolut, Ch Musee 10, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",sarahmarie.gray@unifr.ch,,"Gray, Sarah/0000-0002-4025-6487",Stony Brook University Slobodkin Award;  [NIH GM060731],"I would especially like to thank Dianna Padilla, Dan Dykhuizen, Jessica Gurevitch, Shahid Naeem, Olivier Broennimann and three anonymous reviewers for their edits, useful comments and insight throughout this project.

Many animals, particularly scavengers, use roads as they provide a reliable source of food, such as carrion left after vehicle collisions. Tasmania is often cited as the 'roadkill capital of Australia', with the isolated offshore islands in the Bass Strait experiencing similar, if not higher, levels of roadkill. However, native mammalian predators on the islands are extirpated, meaning the remaining scavengers are likely to experience lower interference competition. In this study, we used a naturally occurring experiment to examine how the loss of mammalian carnivores within a community impacts roadside foraging behaviour by avian scavengers. We monitored the locations of roadkill and forest ravens Corvus tasmanicus, an abundant scavenger species, on eight road transects across the Tasmanian mainland (high scavenging competition) and the Bass Strait islands (low scavenging competition). We represented raven observations as one-dimensional point patterns, using hierarchical Bayesian models to investigate the dependence of raven spatial intensity on habitat, season, distance to roadkill and route location. We found that roadkill carcasses were a strong predictor of raven presence along road networks. The effect of roadkill was amplified on roads on the Bass Strait islands, where roadside carrion was a predictor of raven presence across the entire year. In contrast, ravens were more often associated with roadkill on Tasmanian mainland roads in the autumn, when other resources were low. This suggests that in the absence of competing mammalian scavengers, ravens choose to feed on roadside carrion throughout the year, even in seasons when other resources are available. This lack of competition could be disproportionately benefiting forest ravens, leading to augmented raven populations and changes to the vertebrate community structure. Our study provides evidence that scavengers modify their behaviour in response to reduced scavenger species diversity, potentially triggering trophic shifts and highlighting the importance of conserving or reintroducing carnivores within ecosystems.","[Fielding, Matthew W.; Buettel, Jessie C.; Brook, Barry W.; Yates, Luke A.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Sandy Bay, Tas, Australia; [Fielding, Matthew W.; Buettel, Jessie C.; Brook, Barry W.; Yates, Luke A.] ARC Ctr Excellence Australian Biodivers & Heritag, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Stojanovic, Dejan] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Fielding, MW (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Sandy Bay, Tas, Australia.",Matthew.Fielding@utas.edu.au,"Fielding, Matthew/AAH-4864-2021; Brook, Barry/G-2686-2011","Fielding, Matthew/0000-0003-4536-0192; Brook, Barry/0000-0002-2491-1517; Buettel, Jessie/0000-0001-6737-7468; Yates, Luke/0000-0002-1685-3169",Australian Research Council (ARC)Australian Research Council [FL160100101]; ARC Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage [CE170100015],"Australian Research Council (ARC), Grant/Award Number: FL160100101; ARC Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage, Grant/Award Number: CE170100015",,55,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The system also appears stable. We report on an experimental test of the hypothesis that stability is caused by a refuge for scale. In a grapefruit grove in southern California in 1984-1985, the bark in the interior part of the tree provided a partial refuge from parasitism. Scale were approximate to 100 times denser there than in the exterior of trees. In a field experiment, we removed Argentine ants from some blocks of trees to test whether (1) ants caused the refuge by interfering with Aphytis and (2) the expected reduction in scale density in the refuge would lead to an unstable interaction in the exterior. We also tested for density-dependent parasitism, host mutilation, and predation by analyzing data from samples and from scale placed in the field. The temporal variability of the scale was at the low end of the range recorded in field populations. The experiment provided some evidence in support of the refuge hypothesis. The population in the refuge fluctuated much less than that in the exterior. Ant exclusion led to increased parasitism and lower scale density in the interior, and to increased fluctuations in abundance in the refuge and exterior. However, these changes were relatively small and perhaps temporary, suggesting that (1) ants are not the main cause of the refuge and that (2) we did not reduce the refuge density enough to determine whether the system would go unstable in the absence of the refuge population. Parasitism, host mutilation, and predation rates on scale showed no temporal density dependence, either direct or delayed, though detection of such patterns is difficult. Possible alternative stabilizing mechanisms include size-dependent interactions between red scale and Aphytis.","UNIV CALIF RIVERSIDE,DEPT ENTOMOL,RIVERSIDE,CA 92507; DALHOUSIE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,HALIFAX,NS B3H 4J1,CANADA; AGR CANADA,RES STN,LETHBRIDGE,AB T1J 4B1,CANADA; SO FOREST EXPT STN,FOREST INSECT RES,PINEVILLE,LA 71360","MURDOCH, WW (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,DEPT BIOL SCI,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106, USA.",,,,,,,33,59,59,0,13,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,TEMPE,"ARIZONA STATE UNIV CENTER ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, TEMPE, AZ 85287",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1995,76,1,,,,,206,217,,10.2307/1940642,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,QC872,WOS:A1995QC87200017,,,,,2021-09-27,

Few studies however, have systematically examined the effect of commercial scale bioenergy plantations on biodiversity in agri-ecosystems. In this study we investigate how the abundance and diversity of two key components of farmland biodiversity (ground flora and winged invertebrates) varied between mature willow Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) and two alternative land-use options (arable crops and set-aside land). Although the abundance of winged invertebrates was similar across all land-uses, taxonomic composition varied markedly. Hymenoptera and large Hemiptera (>5 mm) were more abundant in willow SRC than in arable or set-aside. Similarly although plant species richness was greater in set-aside, our data show that willow SRC supports a different plant community to the other land-uses, being dominated by competitive perennial species such as Elytrigia repens and Urtica dioica. Our results suggest that under current management practices a mixed farming system incorporating willow SRC can benefit native farm-scale biodiversity. In particular the reduced disturbance in willow SRC allows the persistence of perennial plant species, potentially providing a stable refuge and food sources for invertebrates. In addition, increased Hymenoptera abundance in willow SRC could potentially have concomitant effects on ecosystem processes, as many members of this Order are important pollinators of crop plants or otherwise fulfil an important beneficial role as predators or parasites of crop pests.

Among the light types used for street lamps, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are expected to become globally predominant within the next few years. In a large-scale field experiment, we recorded bat activity at 46 street lights for 12 nights each and investigated how the widespread replacement of conventional illuminants by LEDs affects urban bats: we compared bat activity at municipal mercury vapour (MV) street lamps that were replaced by LEDs with control sites that were not changed.Pipistrellus pipistrellus was the most frequently recorded species; it was 45% less active at LEDs than at MV street lamps, but the activity did not depend on illuminance level. Light type did not affect the activity of Pipistrellus nathusii, Pipistrellus pygmaeus or bats in the Nyctalus/Eptesicus/Vespertilio (NEV) group, yet the activity of P.nathusii increased with illuminance level. Bats of the genus Myotis increased activity 45-fold at LEDs compared with MV lights, but illuminance level had no effect. Decreased activity of P.pipistrellus, which are considered light tolerant, probably paralleled insect densities around lights. Further, our results suggest that LEDs may be less repelling for light-averse Myotis spp. than MV lights. Accordingly, the transition from conventional lighting techniques to LEDs may greatly alter the anthropogenic impact of artificial light on urban bats and might eventually affect the resilience of urban bat populations.Synthesis and applications. At light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the competitive advantage - the exclusive ability to forage on insect aggregations at lights - is reduced for light-tolerant bats. Thus, the global spread of LED street lamps might lead to a more natural level of competition between light-tolerant and light-averse bats. This effect could be reinforced if the potential advantages of LEDs over conventional illuminants are applied in practice: choice of spectra with relatively little energy in the short wavelength range; reduced spillover by precisely directing light; dimming during low human activity times; and control by motion sensors. Yet, the potential benefits of LEDs could be negated if low costs foster an overall increase in artificial lighting.","[Lewanzik, Daniel; Voigt, Christian C.] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Alfred Kowalke Str 17, D-10315 Berlin, Germany; [Lewanzik, Daniel; Voigt, Christian C.] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dept Anim Behav, Takustr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Lewanzik, D (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Alfred Kowalke Str 17, D-10315 Berlin, Germany.; Lewanzik, D (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Dept Anim Behav, Takustr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",dlewanzik@orn.mpg.de,"Lewanzik, Daniel/I-4686-2019","Lewanzik, Daniel/0000-0003-3305-6556",Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF),"We are grateful to the municipal administrations of Ahorn, Berlin, Coburg, Delbruck, Ebringen, Freiburg, Rietberg, Schulzendorf and Velten for information about their street light management and for permission to fix batcorders at lamp posts.

In the present study, we determined the spatial and temporal dynamics and the regulatory factors of M. persicae populations in bell pepper crops. The number of aphids and their natural enemies were evaluated during 2 years in four commercial bell pepper fields. Myzus persicae density data were related to temperature, rainfall, and natural enemies by multiple regression analysis and were then submitted to geostatistical analysis. The density of M. persicae was higher during the plant's reproductive growth stage. Rainfall, Chrysoperla spp., and Toxomerus spp. regulate M. persicae populations. Initial infestations of this pest occur along the edges of the fields and subsequently spread towards the center. This information is useful for integrated management programs aimed at anticipating periods of higher abundance of M. persicae and identifying arthropods to be prioritized in biological control.","[Soares, J.

We investigated the diet of this exotic population to assess potential impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. Seventy-six frogs were collected from three different habitats and their diet items assigned to parataxonomic units (PU) within orders. Stomach contents were diverse, containing 467 prey items from 19 orders and 135 PU, with extrapolation suggesting a diet of similar to 200 PU. Shannon diversity estimates of prey items consumed produced different rankings for the three habitats at the PU and order level. Therefore, estimates at the order level may not be representative of the actual diversity of prey items. L. cyclorhyncha consumed mainly arthropods and low numbers of conspecific young frogs, geckos and a juvenile house mouse. This generalist, indiscriminate predatory diet is similar to that of other hylids and implies that the species poses a risk to native biodiversity and ecosystem processes by predation and competition. Therefore, further spread of this species needs to be prevented.

Survival was significantly reduced by the presence of predators, but was not differentially affected by larval density. Only 0.33% of the tadpoles survived with fish, 48.9% with newts, and 70.8% with odonates. Survival was highest (93.4%) in control ponds. Survival in ponds with fish, newts, and control ponds was not affected by genotype, however, in ponds with odonates the survival of R. esculents was higher than that of R. lessonae. The higher survival of R. esculenta appeared to be correlated with lower activity of tadpoles. The percentage of survivors that metamorphosed was significantly affected by larval density, but not by predators or genotype of tadpole. Of the surviving tadpoles, 90.6% reared at high larval density and 96.4% reared at the low density metamorphosed. Metamorphs emerged larger in ponds with more intense predation and at low larval density. Rana esculenta tadpoles emerged sooner than those of R. lessonae. Rana esculenta hybrid tadpoles outperformed the parental species R. lessonae in days to metamorphosis. Results from my experiment suggest that the hybrid R. esculenta is equally or more successful than the parental species R. lessonae when reared with some aquatic predators.

As a stream grazer seeks periphyton that are heterogeneously distributed, a shift in its behavior on the basis of the intensity of microalgal cues would be beneficial as it would allow the grazer to feed on more periphyton. Using a caddisfly grazer, Glossosoma larvae, we conducted a laboratory channel experiment with upstream experimental plates having four levels of periphyton abundance ( control, low, medium, and high), and we recorded the movement behavior of the larvae. As periphyton abundance increased, both larval crawling time and the total crawling distance to the periphyton patch significantly decreased and the directness of the crawling path significantly increased. That is, larvae crawled in various directions as they approached a relatively low-abundance periphyton patch, whereas they crawled straight to the high-abundance periphyton patch in a short time. The behavior change was likely due to the detection of some microalgal cue, which should intensify with an increase in upstream periphyton abundance.","[Katano, Izumi] Nara Womens Univ, KYOUSEI Sci Ctr Life & Nat, Nara 630, Japan; [Katano, Izumi] Publ Works Res Inst, Aqua Restorat Res Ctr, Gifu, Japan; [Doi, Hideyuki] Ehime Univ, Fac Agr, LAFWEDY, Matsuyama, Ehime 790, Japan; [Oishi, Tadashi] Nara Saho Coll, Nara, Japan","Katano, I (corresponding author), Nara Womens Univ, KYOUSEI Sci Ctr Life & Nat, Kitauoya Nishimachi, Nara 630, Japan.",streamgrazer@yahoo.co.jp,"Doi, Hideyuki/D-2012-2010","Doi, Hideyuki/0000-0002-2701-3982; Katano, Izumi/0000-0002-1657-619X","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16370012, B18710031]; Water Resources Environment Technology Center, Japan [200604]","We thank S.

In three different habitats obtained in a gradient of time since fire in Catalonia (NE Spain), we have evaluated the effects of seed predators (ants, rodents and birds) on post-dispersal seed removal and early seedling establishment of P. nigra by using selective exclosures limiting their access to seeds. Ants were the most efficient seed predator group, followed by rodents and birds. The contribution of each group to overall predation showed large seasonal variations. The first seeds dispersed in winter were mainly predated by rodents, which also registered their highest abundance in this season of the year. In spring, at the end of the natural dissemination period of P. nigra seeds, ants became the major predators, this fact coinciding with their increased abundance. Birds showed the lowest predation values. In the seedling establishment experiment, only in the exclusion treatment of the three predator groups was there initial establishment in all habitats, especially in the recently burned area, where there was seedling establishment in all exclusion treatments. The post-dispersal seed predation by different animal groups and low seedling emergence in the different habitats obtained in this study, together with the low seed availability of P. nigra seeds in burned areas, do not predict a favourable outlook for the natural post-fire recolonization of this species, which might even affect its overall distribution area in the region.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Ciencias, Unidad Ecol, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain","Ordonez, JL (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Fac Ciencias, Unidad Ecol, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",javier.retana@uab.es,"Retana, Javier/L-1214-2014","Retana, Javier/0000-0002-7505-9467",,,,74,47,48,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,AUG,2004,27,4,,,,,449,458,,10.1111/j.0906-7590.2004.03886.x,,,10,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,822IR,WOS:000221533100005,,,,,2021-09-27,

The higher metabolic rates and periodic foraging behavior associated with winter activity, however, can be incompatible with high levels of freeze avoidance. This is thought to be due, in part, to increased ice nucleators in the gut after feeding events and physiological complications brought on by accumulating certain cryoprotectants. To characterize the relationship between winter activity and cold hardiness, this study quantified the seasonal resistance to freezing in two common wolf spiders of hardwood forests in the eastern USA, Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz) and Schizocosa stridulans (Stratton) (Araneae: Lycosidae). Individual spiders were collected from a deciduous forest in Kentucky from August 2012 to March 2013 and were subjected to supercooling point (SCP) determination assays. Contrary to many invertebrates with high cold hardiness, mean SCP of S.ocreata and S.stridulans remained constant throughout the study, which we subsequently determined was their lower lethal temperature. Interestingly, daily low temperatures within the leaf litter occasionally fell below the mean SCP of the spiders, subjecting them to a significant risk of freezing during winter. To determine whether this high risk was a result of winter predation, we fed spiders varying quantities of prey, but found no significant association between consumption and SCP. Despite exposure to potentially lethal temperatures, Schizocosa did not seasonally augment their cold hardiness to better survive. This suggests an ecological tradeoff, where these spiders appear to assume increased mortality risk in exchange for maximized growth opportunity during a time of year when few competitors are active. We posit that the increased fitness benefits associated with early maturation and larger size in spring help to sustain these abundant spider populations.","[Whitney, Thomas D.; Harwood, James D.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Entomol, Lexington, KY 40546 USA; [Philip, Benjamin N.] Rivier Univ, Dept Biol, Nashua, NH 03060 USA","Harwood, JD (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Entomol, Lexington, KY 40546 USA.",james.harwood@uky.edu,,"Harwood, James/0000-0002-0018-7288",National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF); University of Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station State Project [KY008055]; University of Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station [14-08-022],"This research was supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program and University of Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station State Project KY008055.

Both theoretical models and empirical evidence suggest that offspring begging can be an honest signal of hunger or a mediator of competition between siblings. At a behavioural mechanistic level, begging for food can be a form of harassment aimed at persuading those in possession of food to share. Food sharing, defined as the transfer of a defendable food item from one individual to another, can vary considerably between species, age-classes and food type and abundance. We investigated the determinants of begging and food-sharing behaviours in Asian small-clawed otters (Aonyx cinereus), a groupliving species that commonly exhibits begging in captivity. We presented two captive otter populations with three food types that varied in exploitation complexity, in three different abundances. We predicted that begging rates would be highest when food was in lowest abundance and hardest to exploit, and that increased begging would lead to increased food sharing. We found that, over time, increased begging rates were indeed correlated with increased food transfers, but neither food type complexity nor abundance affected begging or sharing rates. However, age category was significantly associated with begging and food sharing rates: juvenile otters begged more and shared less than adult otters. The results from this first experimental study on begging and food sharing within the Mustelid family begin to reveal some of the drivers of these behaviours.","[Bowden-Parry, Madison; Postma, Erik; Boogert, Neeltje J.] Univ Exeter, Dept Biosci, Penryn, Cornwall, England","Bowden-Parry, M (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Dept Biosci, Penryn, Cornwall, England.",bowdenparry@gmail.com,,,,,,108,0,0,2,4,PEERJ INC,LONDON,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",2167-8359,,,PEERJ,PeerJ,NOV 30,2020,8,,,,,,,,e10369,10.7717/peerj.10369,,,25,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,OY2QL,WOS:000594095800003,33335807,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-27,

The bromeligenous frog, Phyllodytes luteolus (Yellow Heart-Tongued Frog), uses bromeliads for its entire life cycle including shelter, foraging, and reproduction. We evaluated the effect of plant morphometrics and the properties of water accumulated in bromeliads on the selection of these plants by P. luteolus. We sampled 103 bromeliads of which 41 were unoccupied and 62 were occupied by P. luteolus. Results suggest that bromeliad occupation by P. luteolus is nonrandom. We found that occupied plants were shorter in height, had a greater number of leaves, and had lower water conductivity than did unoccupied plants. Males were more likely to occupy plants with more leaves than were females. Plant selection may be related to the reproductive success of P. luteolus because frogs using plants with more leaves and lower conductivity may experience reductions in competition for space, predator encounters, and desiccation. Considering that illegal bromeliad harvesting threatens many bromeligenous frogs, improved understanding of bromeliad selection may determine which bromeliad species should be targeted for conservation to ensure the population viability of frogs.","[Mageski, Marcio M.; Costa, Larissa C.; Jesus, Paulo R.; Medeiros, Cinthia C.; Ferreira, Paulo D.] Univ Vila Velha, Dept Ecol Ecossistemas, Vila Velha, Espirito Santo, Brazil; [Ferreira, Rodrigo B.; Beard, Karen H.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Ferreira, Rodrigo B.; Beard, Karen H.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Mageski, MM (corresponding author), Univ Vila Velha, Dept Ecol Ecossistemas, Vila Velha, Espirito Santo, Brazil.",marcioherpetologia@gmail.com,"Beard, Karen/B-7177-2011","Beard, Karen/0000-0003-4997-2495; Corteletti, Larissa/0000-0002-2821-2561; Ferreira, Rodrigo/0000-0001-6099-5116",Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Espirito Santo (FAPES); Ecology Center at Utah State University; Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [231020/2013-9],"We are grateful to A.

It was recently shown in laboratory experiments that two species of pitcher-dwelling crab spiders (Thomisidae), Thomisus nepenthiphilus and Misumenops nepenthicola, increased capture rates of flesh flies (Sarcophagidae) for their host, Nepenthes gracilis. The spiders ambushed pitcher-visiting flesh flies and dropped their carcasses into pitchers after consuming them. The consumption of shared prey-resources by crab spiders and pitcher plants presents the possibility of parasitism between them. However, ecologically generalizable mechanisms that predict the context-dependent outcomes of such mutualisms are not known. The effectiveness framework (mutualism effectiveness = quality x quantity) is useful for examining the total effect of mutualisms, but its quality component can be difficult to define. We identify the crab spider-pitcher plant interaction as a type of resource conversion mutualism and propose that the quality component in such interactions is the amount of the underlying resource contained in each unit of resource processed. We then used the crab spider-pitcher plant interaction to test the hypothesis that resource conversion mutualisms are more beneficial to the nutrient recipient when operating through high-quality resources (i.e., large prey, in this interaction). We sampled the prey and inquilines of 107 N. gracilis upper pitches in situ and analysed the differences between pitchers that were inhabited or uninhabited by crab spiders, and the differences between nutritional contents of prey that were consumed by crab spiders or not. Pitchers inhabited by T. nepenthiphilus contained higher numbers of several prey taxa, many of which were flying insects. Consumption by T. nepenthiphilus reduced the nutrient contents in all prey examined. Overall, T. nepenthiphilus-assisted prey capture is likely to result in a net nutrient gain for N. gracilis that is proportional to the size of prey consumed by T. nepenthiphilus. Our results suggest that resource conversion mutualisms are more likely to operate through high-quality resources, since the nutrient-processing species necessarily reduces the quality of the resource it processes while increasing its availability to the nutrient recipient species.","[Lam, Weng Ngai; Tan, Hugh T.

We studied the hypothesis that herbivores indirectly affect vegetation structure by changing the availability of soil nutrients, which, in turn, alters the competition between trees and grasses. Nine abandoned livestock holding-pen areas (kraals), enriched by dung and urine, were contrasted with nearby control sites in a semi-arid savanna. About 40 years after abandonment, kraal sites still showed high soil concentrations of inorganic N, extractable P, K, Ca and Mg compared to controls. Kraals also had a high plant production potential and offered high quality forage. The intense grazing and high herbivore dung and urine deposition rates in kraals fit the accelerated nutrient cycling model described for fertile systems elsewhere. Data of a concurrent experiment also showed that bush-cleared patches resulted in an increase in impala dung deposition, probably because impala preferred open sites to avoid predation. Kraal sites had very low tree densities compared to control sites, thus the high impala dung deposition rates here may be in part driven by the open structure of kraal sites, which may explain the persistence of nutrients in kraals. Experiments indicated that tree seedlings were increasingly constrained when competing with grasses under fertile conditions, which might explain the low tree recruitment observed in kraals. In conclusion, large herbivores may indirectly keep existing nutrient hotspots such as abandoned kraals structurally open by maintaining a high local soil fertility, which, in turn, constrains woody recruitment in a negative feedback loop. The maintenance of nutrient hotspots such as abandoned kraals by herbivores contributes to the structural heterogeneity of nutrient-poor savanna vegetation.","[van der Waal, Cornelis; Kool, Ada; Meijer, Seline S.; Kohi, Edward; Heitkonig, Ignas M.

The maintenance of this coexistence, and hence the persistence of sperm-dependent asexual species, may depend on ecological niche separation or preference by males for conspecific (i.e. sexual) mates. We first modified an analytical model to consider both of these mechanisms acting simultaneously on the coexistence of the two species. Our model indicates that a small amount of niche separation between parental species and hybrids can facilitate coexistence by weakening the requirement for male mate preference. We also estimated niche separation empirically in the Chrosomus (formerly Phoxinus) sexual-asexual system based on diet overlap between sperm-dependent asexuals and their two sexual host species. Diet overlap between the sexual species was not significant in either lake, whereas the sperm-dependent asexual had an intermediate niche that overlapped significantly, but somewhat asymmetrically, with both sexual species. These empirical results were then used to parameterize our analytical model to predict the minimum strength of male mate preference required to maintain coexistence in each lake. Some male mate preference is likely required to maintain coexistence in the Chrosomus system, but the minimum required preference depends on the severity of density dependence. Future empirical work on understanding coexistence in sperm-dependent asexual systems would benefit from taking both niche separation and mate choice into account, and from simultaneous empirical estimates of male mate choice, niche separation, and density dependence.","[Mee, Jonathan A.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Noddin, Fred; Hanisch, Justin R.; Tonn, William M.; Paszkowski, Cynthia A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","Mee, JA (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",jamee@ucalgary.ca,,"Mee, Jonathan/0000-0003-0688-1390","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Alberta Innovates Technology Futures; Alberta Conservation Association; Alberta Ingenuity Fund; Alberta Sport, Recreation, Parks and Wildlife Foundation; Canadian Circumpolar Institute; D.

We investigated its direct and indirect effects on food web structure and ecosystem properties (e.g. species biomasses and production) in the Porsanger Fjord in the study period 2009-2011 using 5 subarea Ecopath food web models. The 5 baseline models with different red king crab densities were compared and the food web effects of crab removal were explored through simulations in Ecosim. King crabs were important as benthic predators and exerted strong top-down effects on long-living invertebrates such as predatory gastropods, asteroids, detritivorous echinoderms and herbivorous sea urchins. The crab experienced little predation from fish or other predators at higher trophic levels, thus food web effects of the red king crab generally stayed within the benthic compartment. Red king crab removal decreased system omnivory and resulted in higher food web biomass-low turnover systems, with relatively lower production:biomass ratios of benthic invertebrates. Other ecosystem properties (e.g. total production, consumption, ascendancy and overhead) were little affected by crab abundance and suggest stable systems. Effects of crab removal were less significant in baseline models with low initial crab biomass, and high benthic production by detritivores in the inner fjord may buffer future predation in this area. Indirect effects of crab predation included a positive cascade effect on macroalgae due to predation on herbivorous sea urchins and a negative effect on benthic-feeding birds, indicating competition for invertebrate prey.","[Pedersen, Torstein; Fuhrmann, Mona M.; Nilssen, Einar M.; Ivarjord, Trond; Sivertsen, Knut; Kallgren, Emma; Michaelsen, Christer; Norrbin, Fredrika] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Lindstrom, Ulf; Ramasco, Virginie; Jorgensen, Lis L.; Sundet, Jan H.; Hjelset, Ann Merete; Bjorge, Arne; Steen, Henning; Nilssen, Kjell T.] Inst Marine Res, N-9294 Tromso, Norway; [Systad, Geir] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Bergen Dept, N-5008 Bergen, Norway; [Svenning, Martin-A] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Fram Ctr, Dept Arctic Ecol, N-9296 Tromso, Norway","Pedersen, T (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",torstein.pedersen@uit.no,"Norrbin, Fredrika/L-6670-2019; Lindstrom, Ulf/AAU-1327-2020","Systad, Geir Helge Rodli/0000-0002-9291-4517","Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [188955]; UiT, The Arctic University of Norway","We thank the crew of RV 'Johan Ruud' for assistance during the field campaign and the Research Council of Norway for providing funding for the EPIGRAPH programme (The Research Council of Norway, project no. 188955).

To mitigate such impacts, it is essential to identify the proximate causes of such mesocarnivore releases. Here, we assess to what extent increased partial migration in semi-domesticated tundra reindeer induce a response in boreal and arctic mesocarnivores. We used a large-scale and multiyear quasi-experimental study design with camera traps deployed on coastal tundra peninsulas in northern Norway to estimate area occupancy of the whole carnivore community. These peninsulas represent summer pastures for separate semi-domestic reindeer herds that, owing to different degrees of partial migration, now display spatially and temporally variable densities of year-round resident reindeer. We estimated resident reindeer density by means of aerial surveys. Area occupancy of all the recorded carnivore species increased strongly when resident reindeer densities exceeded 15deerkm(-2). Most of the increasing carnivore species were typical boreal forest species, implying range expansions into tundra when provided with stable food resources (prey and carrion) in terms of resident reindeer.Synthesis and applications. We found that boreal mesocarnivores, known to negatively impact the productivity of reindeer and arctic wildlife of conservation concern, steeply increased in tundra areas with many year-round resident reindeer due to increased partial migration. To avoid such negative impacts, actions should be taken to minimize residency in tundra reindeer.

The study of biofilms is important in many biological fields, including environmental science, food production, and medicine. However, few studies have focused on such bacterial biofilms, partially due to the difficulty of investigating them. Most of the methods for qualitative and quantitative biofilm analyses described in the literature are only suitable for biofilms forming on abiotic surfaces or on homogeneous and thin biotic surfaces, such as a monolayer of epithelial cells. While laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) is often used to analyze in situ and in vivo biofilms, this technology becomes very challenging when applied to bacterial biofilms on fungal hyphae, due to the thickness and the three dimensions of the hyphal networks. To overcome this shortcoming, we developed a protocol combining microscopy with a method to limit the accumulation of hyphal layers in fungal colonies. Using this method, we were able to investigate the development of bacterial biofilms on fungal hyphae at multiple scales using both LSCM and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This report describes the protocol, including microorganism cultures, bacterial biofilm formation conditions, biofilm staining, and LSCM and SEM visualizations.","[Guennoc, Cora Miquel; Guinnet, Frederic; Miquel, Igor; Deveau, Aurelie] Univ Lorraine, INRA, UMR1136, Interact Arbres Microorganismes, Nancy, France; [Rose, Christophe] Univ Lorraine, INRA, UMR 1137, Ecol & Ecophysiol Forestieres PTEF, Nancy, France; [Labbe, Jessy] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Biosci Div, Oak Ridge, TN USA","Deveau, A (corresponding author), Univ Lorraine, INRA, UMR1136, Interact Arbres Microorganismes, Nancy, France.",aurelie.deveau@inra.fr,", Deveau/AAD-4442-2020; Labbe, Jessy/G-9532-2011",", Deveau/0000-0001-6266-5241; Labbe, Jessy/0000-0003-0368-2054",French National Research Agency through the Laboratory of Excellence ARBREFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-LABX-0002-01]; Plant-Microbe Interfaces Scientific Focus Area in the Genomic Science Program; Office of Biological and Environmental Research in the DOE Office of ScienceUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); United States Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC05-00OR22725],"This work was supported by the French National Research Agency through the Laboratory of Excellence ARBRE (ANR-11-LABX-0002-01), the Plant-Microbe Interfaces Scientific Focus Area in the Genomic Science Program, and the Office of Biological and Environmental Research in the DOE Office of Science.

Regardless of weed cover, predator densities on the soil surface, weeds, and cane stalks were decreased by the nematicide, and percentage of internodes injured by sugarcane borers increased by at least 19%. Fenvalerate (insecticide) reduced predators and prey arthropods on the soil surface and cane stalks, including Solenopsis invicta Buren.

This reduction occurs although no mortal injuries to workers can occur (conspecifics are separated by mesh), and despite ad libitum food availability. Thus, decreased brood biomass is a consequence of behavioural decision(s) rather than food limitations or reduced numbers of brood tenders.

Size, shape, stable orientation, and surface residence-time were identified as key factors governing encrustation. The encrusters on fossil Echinolampas were bryozoans, serpulid polychaetes, barnacles, and coralline algae, while the recent material was initially encrusted by serpulids and hydrozoan colonies, and ultimately covered by the lull range of sessile, hemi-sessile, and vagile species characterizing the benthic community in the Adriatic. In Echinolampas, epigrowth was more abundant on the lower (oral) surface; this specific distribution was echoed in S. canaliferus, where epigrowth started on the bottom side and grew upward. This indicates that the tests have a stable orientation and a surface residence-time long enough to allow intense encrustation. A taphonomic model is developed, and the role of encrustation on such special substrates for overall community structure is discussed. The Recent/fossil comparison provides new insights for both fields of study: the recent material indicates the role of soft-bodied faunas as well as the complexity of small-scaled ecological processes; the fossil material reflects many of the above phenomena and adds important taphonomic details on the fate of encrusted biogenic structures and on encruster growth patterns and distributions.","Univ Tubingen, Inst & Museum Geol & Palaontol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; Museum Nat Hist, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; Univ Vienna, Inst Zool, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Nebelsick, JH (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Inst & Museum Geol & Palaontol, Sigwartstr 10, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",nebelsick@uni-tuebingen.de; brigitta.schmid@mailbox.nhm-wien.ac.at; mischkas@zoo.univie.ac.at,,,,,,85,65,67,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0024-1164,1502-3931,,LETHAIA,Lethaia,DEC,1997,30,4,,,,,271,284,,,,,14,Paleontology,Paleontology,YU166,WOS:000071688900002,,,,,2021-09-27,

By incorporating different feeding strategies, from selective particulate feeding to cruising filter feeding, fish species target distinct prey. In this study, we investigated the effects of two species with different feeding strategies, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus (L.)) and roach (Rutilus rutilus (L.)), on a low-diversity brackish water zooplankton community using a 16-day mesocosm experiment. The experiment was conducted on a small-bodied spring zooplankton community in high-nutrient conditions, as well as a large-bodied summer community in low-nutrient conditions. Effects were highly dependent on the initial zooplankton community structure and hence seasonal variation. In a small-bodied community with high predation pressure and no dispersal or migration, the selective particulate-feeding stickleback depleted the zooplankton community and decreased its diversity more radically than the cruising filter-feeding roach. Cladocerans rather than copepods were efficiently removed by predation, and their removal caused altered patterns in rotifer abundance. In a large-bodied summer community with initial high taxonomic and functional diversity, predation pressure was lower and resource availability was high for omnivorous crustaceans preying on other zooplankton. In this community, predation maintained diversity, regardless of predator species. During both experimental periods, predation influenced the competitive relationship between the dominant calanoid copepods, and altered species composition and size structure of the zooplankton community. Changes also occurred to an extent at the level of nontarget prey, such as microzooplankton and rotifers, emphasizing the importance of subtle predation effects. We discuss our results in the context of the adaptive foraging mechanism and relate them to the natural littoral community.","[Helenius, Laura K.; Leskinen, Elina; Lehtonen, Hannu; Nurminen, Leena] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Helenius, Laura K.] Univ Helsinki, Tvarminne Zool Stn, Hango 10900, Finland; [Padros, Anna Ayma] Inst Marine Sci ICM CSIC, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Padros, Anna Ayma] Univ Barcelona, Dept Marine Stratig Paleontol & Geosci, GRC Marine Geosci, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Helenius, LK (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",laura.helenius@helsinki.fi,,,Walter and Andree de Nottbeck Foundation; Maa- ja vesitekniikan tuki ry,This study was supported by grants from Walter and Andree de Nottbeck Foundation and Maa- ja vesitekniikan tuki ry.,,60,9,9,1,46,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The seasonal succession of phytoplankton is characterized by a shift in dominance from eukaryotic species to prokaryotic cyanobacteria, as in a eutrophic lake. This unusual pattern for an oligotrophic lake is related to the release of zooplankton phosphorus, rather than to the amount of total phosphorus. The highest estimated values of this released phosphorus occur during the co-dominance of small-sized species and of one calanoid population, both under natural and experimental conditions. Our experimental results clearly reveal that a blue-green species replaces non-blue-green ones when environmental conditions render low or intermediate values for released phosphorus, irrespective of the grazing pressure. The absence of predators or high levels of released phosphorus stimulate non-blue-green growth. These results agree with the successional pattern observed for the algal assemblage under natural conditions. Nutrient recycling plays an essential role in the maintenance of the metabolism of the pelagic system, and therefore the prevalence of a top-down regulation mechanism as proposed for such low-nutrient environments should be reconsidered.","UNIV GRANADA, FAC CIENCIAS, DEPT BIOL VEGETAL, E-18071 GRANADA, SPAIN; UNIV GRANADA, INST AGUA, E-18071 GRANADA, SPAIN","CARRILLO, P (corresponding author), UNIV GRANADA, FAC CIENCIAS, DEPT BIOL ANIM & ECOL, E-18071 GRANADA, SPAIN.",,"Carrillo, Presentacion/I-1601-2015; Reche, Isabel/K-7120-2014; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis/H-5318-2015","Carrillo, Presentacion/0000-0003-3794-4294; Reche, Isabel/0000-0003-2908-1724; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis/0000-0003-0687-0704",,,,50,40,40,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-7873,1464-3774,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

The phenomenon ranges from ovoviviparity (eggs deposited at an advanced stage of embryonic development; larva emerges immediately after deposition), through viviparity (larva hatches inside female before deposition) to pupiparity (offspring deposited as pupa). Some Diptera are known to be facultatively viviparous, which is hypothesized to be a step towards the evolution of obligate viviparity. Obligate viviparity is found to comprise unilarviparity (single large larva in maternal uterus) which evolved many times independently, the rare oligolarviparity (more than one but not more than 12 larvae) and multilarviparity (large numbers of developing eggs or larvae in uterus) which is typical for the two largest clades of viviparous Diptera. Unilarviparity is either lecithotrophic (developing larva nourished by yolk of egg) or pseudo-placental (larva nourished by glandular secretions of mother). Viviparity has clearly evolved on many separate occasions in Diptera. It is recorded in 22 families, and this review identifies at least 61 independent origins of viviparity. Six families appear to have viviparity in their ground-plan. Some families have a single evolution of viviparity, others multiple evolutions. Guimaraes' model for the evolution of viviparity in Diptera is tested against phylogenetic information and the adaptive significance of viviparity is reviewed in detail. Possible correlations with life-history parameters (coprophily, parasitism, breeding in ephemeral plant parts, malacophagy and adult feeding habits - especially haematophagy) are analysed critically, as are potential advantages (shorter larval life, less investment in yolk by mother, protection of vulnerable stages, better access to breeding substrates, predation on competitors). Morphological constraints, adaptations and exaptations are reviewed, including the provision of an incubation space for the egg(s), the positioning of the egg(s) in the uterus, and maternal glands. The main morphological adaptations include greater egg size, reduction of egg respiratory filaments, thinning of chorion, modified larval respiratory system and mouthparts, and instar skipping. Female morphology and behaviour is particularly strongly modified for viviparity. The terminalia are shortened, the vagina is more muscular and tracheated, and the ovaries of unilarviparous species have a reduced number of ovarioles with alternate ovulation. Many of the final conclusions are tentative, and a plea is made for more detailed morphological and experimental study of many of the viviparous species. Viviparity in Diptera provides a fascinating example of multiple parallel evolution, and a fertile field for future research.","Zool Museum, Dept Entomol, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Entomol, New York, NY 10024 USA; Humboldt Univ, Museum Nat Kunde, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; Australian Ctr Int Agr Res, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Meier, R (corresponding author), Zool Museum, Dept Entomol, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",,"Meier, Rudolf/A-7099-2011; Meier, Rudolf/AAB-3848-2021","Meier, Rudolf/0000-0002-4452-2885; Meier, Rudolf/0000-0002-4452-2885",,,,336,122,127,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1464-7931,1469-185X,,BIOL REV,Biol.

It is mainly reported among carnivores that share common herbivorous prey. However, a large chewing herbivore could prey upon sedentary and/or micro herbivores in addition to utilizing a host plant. To investigate such coincidental IGP, we observed the behavioral responses of the polyphagous mite Tetranychus kanzawai Kishida (Acari: Tetranychidae) when its host plant Cayratia japonica (Thunb.) Gagnep. (Vitaceae) was attacked by hornworms, Theretra japonica Boisduval (Sphingidae) and T. oldenlandiae Fabricius (Sphingidae). We also examined an interaction between the oligophagous mite Panonychus citri McGregor (Acari: Tetranychidae) and caterpillars of the swallowtail Papilio xuthus L. (Papilionidae) that share citrus plants as their main food source. Although all T. kanzawai and some active stage P. citri tried to escape from the coincidental IGP, some were consumed together with eggs, quiescent mites, and host plant leaves, suggesting that coincidental IGP occurs on spider mites in the wild. Moreover, neither hornworms nor swallowtail caterpillars distinguished between spider mite-infested and uninfested leaves, suggesting that the mite-infested leaves do not discourage caterpillar feeding. The reasons that the mites have no effective defense against coincidental IGP other than escaping are discussed.","[Shirotsuka, Kanako] Kyoto Univ, Dept Agr, Lab Ecol Informat, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Yano, Shuichi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Ecol Informat, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Shirotsuka, K (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Dept Agr, Lab Ecol Informat, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",kshiro@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Shirotsuka, Kanako/L-7567-2019",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [21580066]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [21580066] Funding Source: KAKEN",We thank two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

However, the definition, composition, influenced factors, and potential function of paddy periphyton are still unclear. We attempt to define paddy periphyton as an integrated and independent microcosm, which is dominated by phototrophic communities, containing both biotic components, such as algal, fungal, bacterial, protozoan, and metazoan, and abiotic components, such as soil, extracellular polymeric substance, and detritus. They interact with each other such as predation and competition, co-inhabiting in a common microhabitat. The development of paddy periphyton mainly includes three processes: growth stage, mature stage, and fading stage. Paddy periphyton has a significant influence on the salt migration in paddy ecosystem that was reclaimed from coastal mudflat by improving the soil structure, assimilating and adsorbing the salt like sodium chloride, and inhibiting the salt accumulation near the soil surface. As for nutrient management, the roles of paddy periphyton can be summarized as a slow-released bio-fertilizer, a nutrient-removal agent, a nutrient mediator, and a nutrient indicator in mudflat-reclaimed paddy ecosystem. All these imply that paddy periphyton may be a new and promising biotechnological tool for better salt and nutrient management in paddy ecosystems that degraded from mudflat land, which has a vast potential in the amelioration and fertility improvement of salt-affected soils, as well as control of nonpoint agricultural pollution in coastal areas.","[Lu, Haiying; Qi, Weicong; Liu, Jia; Bai, Yanchao; Shao, Hongbo] Jiangsu Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Environm, Salt Soil Agr Ctr, Zhongling St 50, Nanjing 210014, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lu, Haiying] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, State Key Lab Soil & Sustainable Agr, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Tang, Boping; Shao, Hongbo] Yancheng Teachers Univ, Jiangsu Synthet Innovat Ctr Coastal Bioagr, Jiangsu Key Lab Bioresources Saline Soils, Yancheng, Peoples R China; [Bai, Yanchao] Yangzhou Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Shao, HB (corresponding author), Jiangsu Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Environm, Salt Soil Agr Ctr, Zhongling St 50, Nanjing 210014, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",shaohongbochu@126.com,"Qi, Weicong/AAF-7057-2021","Qi, Weicong/0000-0001-5459-2767","Shuangchuang Talent Plan of Jiangsu Province, China; Open Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture of China [Y20160035]; Jiangsu Agriculture Science and Technology Innovation Fund [CX(15)1005]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20160594]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41601320]; National Key R&D Program of China [SQ2018YFD080062]","Shuangchuang Talent Plan of Jiangsu Province, China; Open Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture of China, Grant/Award Number: Y20160035; Jiangsu Agriculture Science and Technology Innovation Fund, Grant/Award Number: CX(15)1005; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, Grant/Award Number: BK20160594; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41601320; National Key R&D Program of China, Grant/Award Number: SQ2018YFD080062",,77,4,4,5,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

A comparative functional response approach may offer insight and predictive power regarding the impacts of invasive bivalves. This could prove valuable in the management of invasive species that drive losses in ecosystem function and biodiversity. We conducted feeding experiments to assist in predicting the relative impact of two sympatric species of dreissenid mussel, the zebra and quagga (Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostiformis bugensis, respectively). Feeding rates and functional responses were calculated for each species under different 'contexts', including ranges of algal concentrations and temperatures. Clearance rates ranged from 10 to 44 ml/g mussel/h. Both species exhibited type I functional responses across all contexts studied. There were no differences in the clearance rates or functional responses between species at 4 degrees C and 12 degrees C. Thus, the competitive exclusion of zebra mussels by quagga mussels seen in nature does not appear to be driven by disparities in feeding efficiencies. Both species demonstrated elevated functional responses at the highest temperature (24 degrees C) compared with the lowest temperature (4 degrees C). Zebra mussels showed a significantly higher clearance rate than quagga mussels at 24 degrees C. We conclude that total species abundance, rather than changes in species dominance, is likely to be more important for net species impact. Functional responses may offer considerable explanatory and predictive power under certain contexts; they are particularly fitting for sessile invasive bivalves due to their high feeding rates and the seasonal changes in algae abundance they experience.","[Kemp, Justin S.; Aldridge, David C.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, David Attenborough Bldg,Pembroke St, Cambridge CB2 3QY, England","Kemp, JS (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, David Attenborough Bldg,Pembroke St, Cambridge CB2 3QY, England.",jk696@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,60,9,10,1,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0260-1230,1464-3766,,J MOLLUS STUD,J.

To simulate animal groups interacting with one another, we made an agent-based model in a computational space. Assuming no predation pressure, we change the resource conditions between the habitat (comprising 'interior' and 'edges') and the 'exterior'. The results are as follows: when the group density is high throughout the habitat, large groups tend to frequent the edges (i.e., the boundaries between the interior and exterior) even if food resources are scarce in the exterior. Additionally, when the group density is high and the group size variation is small, both group size and group density increase at the edges. These findings are discussed with reference to primates, particularly the Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata) as an example of group-living animal.","[Horiuchi, Shiro] Okayama Univ Sci, Dept Biosphere Geosphere Syst Sci, Fac Informat, Okayama 7000005, Japan; [Takasaki, Hiroyuki] Okayama Univ Sci, Dept Zool, Fac Sci, Okayama 7000005, Japan","Horiuchi, S (corresponding author), Meiji Univ, Org Strateg Coordinat Res & Intellectual Property, Higashi Mita 1-1-1, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148571, Japan.",horiuchi@isc.meiji.ac.jp,,,"Yakumo Foundation for Environmental Science; Meiji University Global COE; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [23101505] Funding Source: KAKEN","The field workers whose studies are cited here laid the basis of this study.

The evolution of exaggerated vocal signals in anuran species is an important topic. Males and females have both evolved the ability to discriminate communication sounds. However, the nature of sexual dimorphism in cognition and sensory discrimination and in the evolution and limitation of sexual signal exaggeration remain relatively unexplored. Methods. In the present study, we used male calls of varied complexity in the serrate-legged small treefrog, Kurixalus odontotarsus, as probes to investigate how both sexes respond to variations in call complexity and how sex differences in signal discrimination play a role in the evolution of sexual signal exaggeration. The compound calls of male K. odontotarsus consist of a series of one or more harmonic notes (A notes) which may be followed by one or more short broadband notes (B notes). Results. Male playback experiments and female phonotaxis tests showed that increasing the number of A notes in stimulus calls elicits increased numbers of response calls by males and increases the attractiveness of the stimulus calls to females. The addition of B notes, however, reduces male calling responses. Moreover, call stimuli which contain only B notes suppress spontaneous male calling responses. Phonotaxis experiments show that females prefer calls with greater numbers of A notes and calls containing both A notes and B notes, but do not prefer calls with only B notes. Discussion. Male-male competition and female choice appear to have played different roles in the evolution and limitation of signal complexity in K. odontotarsus. These results provide new insights into how exaggerated compound signals evolve and how signal complexity may be limited in anurans.","[Zhu, Bicheng; Zhao, Longhui; Yang, Yue; Tang, Yezhong; Cui, Jianguo] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Dept Herpetol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Bicheng; Zhao, Longhui; Yang, Yue] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jichao; Sun, Zhixin] Hainan Normal Univ, Dept Biol, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qinghua] Minist Environm Protect, South China Inst Environm Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Brauth, Steven E.] Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Cui, JG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Dept Herpetol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",cuijg@cib.ac.cn,"Zhu, Bicheng/AAU-3425-2020",,Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2012274]; CASChinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31772464]; CIB [Y3B3011],"This work was supported by the Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS (No. 2012274), the CAS Light of West China'' Program, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31772464) and the Youth Professor Project of the CIB (No. Y3B3011) to Jianguo Cui.

We measured egg volume, nest density, and distance to the edge of the colony, and investigated their effects on hatching and fledging success. We evaluated also egg predation by the Heermann's Gull (Laws heermanni). Colony size, nesting density, location within the colony, predation by gulls, and a possible food shortage affected breeding success. Nesting density was higher in the centre of colonies (9.57 nests/m(2) +/- 0.28) than at the periphery (8.20 +/- 0.34), and higher in the large colony (9.24 +/- 0.21) than in the small one (6.66 +/- 0.66). Hatching success was higher in the large colony (82.5%) than in the small one (50%), and in central areas than at the periphery. Both colonies attracted similar numbers of Hoermann's Gulls, but these predated eggs at a higher rate in the small (0.54 eggs/h +/- 0.11) than in the large colony (0.25 eggs/h +/- 0.06), and focused predation attempts at the periphery. This highlights the importance of colony size and nest location in protecting against predation in Royal Terns. Similar to other tern studies, egg predation was the main cause of reproductive failure, suggesting that in Royal Terns this is a major selective pressure that contributes to the maintenance of coloniality and regulates minimum colony size.

The ecosystem is notoriously poor in subaquatic vegetation, the main components of manatees' diet. Due to the constant presence of manatees in the bay and their ability to consume large volumes of plant material, it is assumed that the species has a relevant trophic impact on the system. A mass-balance trophic model was designed to describe the flows of energy and matter in the bay, with the goal of assessing the role of manatees in the system. The system was aggregated in eight effective trophic levels. The biomass was intensely concentrated in the detritus, suggesting that the matter on the bottom sediment is the main regulator of the energy flow in the system. Primary producers comprised of detritus, mangrove, benthic autotrophs, and phytoplankton. The apex predators were dolphins and large piscivorous fishes. Manatees occupied the trophic level 2.0. Manatees were directly or indirectly impacted by autotrophs, mangrove, and detritus; but the competition between manatees and other groups was insignificant. In comparison to other ecosystems where manatees occur, Chetumal Bay (BCh) has the lowest relative biomass of seagrasses. Several ecological and behavioral mechanisms to compensate the lack of macrophytes biomass (or a combination of several) are suggested. Ecopath with Ecosim models are useful to describe the flow of energy and matter in the ecosystems. However, there are still critical gaps in the knowledge of BCh and its manatee population. It is difficult to assess the uncertainty associated with the estimates obtained; therefore, results should be interpreted with caution. Improving this preliminary model with robust local information on the Chetumal Bay ecology and its manatee population is recommended.","[Nataly Castelblanco-Martinez, Delma; Jacobo Schmitter-Soto, Juan; Abuid Hernandez-Arana, Hector; Morales-Vela, Benjamin] Colegio Frontera Sur, Chetmal, Quintana Roo, Mexico","Castelblanco-Martinez, DN (corresponding author), Colegio Frontera Sur, Av Centenario Km 5-5, Chetmal, Quintana Roo, Mexico.",castelblanco.nataly@gmail.com,"BARBA, EVERARDO/AAS-3212-2021; Schmitter-Soto, Juan J/F-6206-2010; Hernandez-Arana, Hector A./AAL-2400-2020; Schmitter-Soto, Juan J./L-9719-2019; Schmitter-Soto, Juan/AAF-3707-2020; Castelblanco-Martinez, Nataly/T-5997-2018; Castelblanco-Martinez, Delma Nataly/AAQ-3666-2021; MACIAS, EVERARDO BARBA/AAH-8400-2019","Schmitter-Soto, Juan J/0000-0003-4736-8382; Hernandez-Arana, Hector A./0000-0001-9769-3349; Schmitter-Soto, Juan J./0000-0003-4736-8382; Schmitter-Soto, Juan/0000-0003-4736-8382; Castelblanco-Martinez, Nataly/0000-0003-3229-8406; Castelblanco-Martinez, Delma Nataly/0000-0003-3229-8406; MACIAS, EVERARDO BARBA/0000-0001-7263-8941",CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT),"Part of the field work was possible thanks to the logistic support of El Colegio de la Frontera Sur (ECOSUR), Chetumal.

(60 km off the coast). While the Columbretes Is. colony was established in 1973 and has grown only slightly (ca. 600 pairs in 1995), the Ebro Delta colony was established in 1981 and today holds 70% of total world population (ca. 10300 pairs in 1995). The trawling moratorium has coincided with the breeding season of the species, though the particular breeding stage affected was different each year. The lack of trawl discards caused by the moratorium and the likely decrease of clupeiform populations have affected both the feeding and breeding biology of the species. However, the effects of a reduced food supply were greater in the Columbretes Is., probably because of the lack of alternative food resources. When trawlers operated, the gulls' diet was very similar in the two colonies, but when the moratorium started, significant differences were found at both taxonomic and typologic levels. Prey from rice fields acted as a buffer for the Ebro Delta colony, whereas in the Columbretes Is. the gulls were forced to fish actively, probably at greater energy costs. In the moratorium years, breeding success was always significantly lower in the Columbretes Is. than in the Ebro Delta; extremely, no young fledged in the Columbretes Is. in 1993. Clutch size was also significantly lower in the Columbretes Is. colony, even when the moratorium did not coincide with the laying stage, suggesting that predation by Yellow-legged Gull Lanes cachinnans could be an additional limiting factor at this locality, where the ratio of breeding pairs of Yellow-legged to Audouin's Gulls is much higher than in the Ebro Delta. In contrast to previous studies, the larger colony (Ebro Delta) had better breeding performance than the smaller colony (Columbretes Is.), suggesting that density-dependent effects may not operate in the Ebro Delta colony because of the large variety of foraging habitats (rice fields, lagoons, dunes, beaches) and the high productivity of the sea off this colony. While population size in the Ebro Delta colony suggested the absence of limiting factors until the establishment of the trawling moratorium, the size of the Columbretes Is. colony indicated a breeding site limitation, and probably competition with the Yellow-legged Gull.","RESERVA NAT ILLES COLUMBRETES,GENERALITAT VALENCIANA,CASTELLO 12071,SPAIN; SEO,ESTACIO ORNITOL ALBUFERA,VALENCIA 46012,SPAIN","Oro, D (corresponding author), UNIV BARCELONA,DEPT BIOL ANIM VERTEBRATS,DIAGONAL 645,BARCELONA 08028,SPAIN.",,"Oro, Daniel/H-4208-2012; Genovart, Meritxell/L-4873-2014; Bond, Alexander L/A-3786-2010","Oro, Daniel/0000-0003-4782-3007; Genovart, Meritxell/0000-0003-2919-1288; ",,,,29,55,57,0,9,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0908-8857,,,J AVIAN BIOL,J.

American toads arrive at breeding ponds 4-10 wk after wood frogs and typically select breeding sites that lack wood frog tadpoles. In an experiment conducted in seminatural ponds, adult toads completely avoided ovipositing in ponds with wood frog tadpoles. Additional experiments strongly suggest that predation of wood frog tadpoles on toad eggs and larvae is the primary reason for the evolution of adult avoidance behavior in toads. In one set of experiments, toad eggs and hatchlings suffered complete mortality within two days after being placed in artificial ponds containing natural densities of wood frog tadpoles. Similar mortality occurred when eggs and hatchlings were introduced into natural breeding sites. In one experiment in which 2000 toad hatchlings were added to natural ponds, all were killed and consumed within 45 min by wood frog tadpoles. Although tadpoles of most anurans are considered to be microphagous suspension feeders that occupy lower trophic levels of food chains, a growing body of evidence indicates that many tadpoles can temporarily shift feeding modes to become upper level, macrophagous predators. Because facultative predators such as wood frog tadpoles often reach far higher densities in ponds than do top predators, their role in structuring aquatic communities via opportunistic predation may be more important than previously realized.",,"PETRANKA, JW (corresponding author), UNIV N CAROLINA,DEPT BIOL,ASHEVILLE,NC 28804, USA.",,,,,,,33,92,98,0,14,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS HERPETOLOGISTS BUSINESS OFFICE,CARBONDALE,"SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIV, DEPT ZOOLOGY, CARBONDALE, IL 62901-6501",0045-8511,,,COPEIA,Copeia,AUG 17,1994,,3,,,,,691,697,,10.2307/1447185,,,7,Zoology,Zoology,PD127,WOS:A1994PD12700012,,,,,2021-09-27,

Such changes are observed as organisms invade new environments, and they are often triggered by changed interspecific interactions, such as differences in predation regimes. However, in spite of increased recognition of antagonistic male-female mating interactions, there is very limited evidence that such intraspecific interactions could cause rapid evolutionary dynamics in nature. This is because ecological and longitudinal data from natural populations have been lacking. Here we show that in a color-polymorphic damselfly species, male-female mating interactions lead to rapid evolutionary change in morph frequencies between generations. Field data and computer simulations indicate that these changes are driven by sexual conflict, in which morph fecundities are negatively affected by frequency- and density-dependent male mating harassment. These frequency- dependent processes prevent population divergence by maintaining a female polymorphism in most populations. Although these results contrast with the traditional view of how sexual conflict enhances the rate of population divergence, they are consistent with a recent theoretical model of how females may form discrete genetic clusters in response to male mating harassment.","Lund Univ, Sect Anim Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Svensson, EI (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Sect Anim Ecol, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",erik.svensson@zooekol.lu.se; jessica.abbott@zooekol.lu.se; roger.hardling@zooekol.lu.se,"Abbott, Jessica K/F-5848-2010; Svensson, Erik/E-8324-2010","Abbott, Jessica K/0000-0002-8743-2089; Svensson, Erik/0000-0001-9006-016X",,,,53,186,193,0,47,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Tadpoles preyed upon, comprised between 0.05 and 21.55% of the turtle's biomass. This demonstrated that Pelomedusa subrufa was neither gape limited nor did it ignore very small prey. Tadpoles with an ovoid body shape (Hemisus marmoratus, Hyperolius nitidulus, Ptychadena maccarthyensis), which shared, under natural conditions, the pond bottom microhabitat with the turtles, were more threatened than the robust tall-finned Kassina tadpoles that lived in the middle of the water column. The translucent, slow swimming Phrynomantis microps tadpole occurred in larger ponds and preferred the upper water column in deeper parts of the pond. This species was especially at risk in ponds with reduced water levels. Turtles, in contrast to fish or dragonfly larvae, are capable of migrating to other ponds. They therefore might have a profound regional influence on tadpole communities in ephemeral savanna ponds.","Lehrstuhl Tierokol & Tropenbiol, Theodor Boveri Inst, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany","Rodel, MO (corresponding author), Lehrstuhl Tierokol & Tropenbiol, Theodor Boveri Inst, Hubland, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany.",roedel@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de,,,,,,45,10,14,0,5,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0173-5373,1568-5381,,AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA,Amphib.

The food requirements of juveniles of the two cyclopoid copepods were investigated. Moreover, the importance of algae for the predaceous adults was studied. Nauplii of both M.leuckarti and C.vicinus successfully developed into copepodites when fed the motile algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlamydomonas sphaeroides and Cryptomonas sp. Threshold food concentrations for naupliar development varied between offered algae and between the two cyclopoid species. The food threshold for successful naupliar development, when reared on C.reinhardtii, was lower for M.leuckarti (0.3 mg C l-1) than for C.vicinus (0.5 mg C l-1), whereas a similar food threshold was found using Cryptomonas sp. (0.3 mg C l-1) and C.sphaeroides (<0.2 mg C l-1). Naupliar development time was inversely related to food concentration. Food required for copepodite development differed for the two cyclopoid species. Cyclops vicinus was able to develop to the adult stage on a pure diet of any one of the three algal species, whereas M.leuckarti required a prey supply of the rotifer Brachionus rubens. Food composition, i.e. algal species, algal concentration and rotifer abundance, influenced copepodite survivorship of both cyclopoids and was always higher in the presence of B.rubens. Under similar food conditions, mortality was higher for M.leuckarti than for C.vicinus. Mesocyclops leuckarti females were very dependent on animal food. The predation rate of M.leuckarti was not lower in the presence of algae. Egg production of M.leuckarti was low on a pure algal diet and significantly higher when B.rubens was present. The results were used to discuss the life cycle strategy and the possibility of exploitative competition of the two cyclopoid copepods.","NATL ENVIRONM RES INST,DEPT FRESHWATER ECOL,DK-8600 SILKEBORG,DENMARK; MAX PLANCK INST LIMNOL,W-2320 PLON,GERMANY",,,,,,,,37,81,84,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM,OXFORD,"WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP",0142-7873,,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

However, our knowledge of these effects in the ocean remains scant. It is known that copepods prefer to prey on ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, and their high or low abundances can change the structure of microplankton communities. Field studies in subtropical waters have shown parallel increases of mesozooplankton and phytoplankton without a lag, suggesting a top-down effect of mesozooplankton preying upon microzooplankton and releasing primary producers from predation. In the present work, we added copepods at increasing densities to natural plankton in 24 h experiments. A decrease in aloricated ciliates abundance of nearly 50% and increases in the abundances of picoeukaryotes, Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus, diatoms, and chlorophyll a were observed. No effect of nutrient additions was observed in parallel grazing experiments. Thus, a top-down effect of copepods upon microzooplankton explains the observed changes in the abundance of the different phytoplankton groups. Copepods promote important changes down the food web, structuring the community by predation upon microzooplankton. There are biogeochemical consequences of zooplankton variability over short time scales in the ocean.","[Armengol, Laia; Franchy, Gara; Ojeda, Alicia; Hernandez-Leon, Santiago] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Oceanog & Cambio Global, Campus Taliarte, Telde 35214, Canary Islands, Spain; [Santana-del Pino, Angelo] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Matemat, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain","Armengol, L (corresponding author), Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Oceanog & Cambio Global, Campus Taliarte, Telde 35214, Canary Islands, Spain.",laia.armengol@ulpgc.es,"Santana, Angelo/ABH-4528-2020; Armengol, Laia/AAX-9718-2021; Hernandez-Leon, Santiago/M-2563-2014","Santana, Angelo/0000-0002-6513-4814; Armengol, Laia/0000-0002-0479-5571; Hernandez-Leon, Santiago/0000-0002-3085-4969",project Lucifer [CTM2008-03538]; project Malaspina [CSD2008-00077]; project Mafia [CTM2012-39587]; project Bathypelagic [CTM2016-78853-R]; Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government,"We wish to thank Sabrina Sanchez, Almudena Valenciano, Lidia Nieves, Valeria Anabalon, and Claire Schmoker for their help onboard.

The studies reported here provided insights into behavioral and functional responses of the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren) parasitoid, Pseudacteon tricuspis (Borgmeier) that were previously unknown. Laboratory studies were performed to quantify aggregative responses of P. tricuspis adults to variable host ant densities, determine effect of direct mutual interference between multiple ovipositing P. tricuspis females confined with host S. invicta, elucidate the effect of confining one or two additional males with premated females on progeny sex ratios, and determine the form of the functional response of individual ovipositing P. tricuspis. Consistent with theory and field observations, P. tricuspis tended to aggregate at host patches containing greater numbers of ants. Some evidence of direct mutual interference was found, as per capita oviposition success declined when more than one female was confined and weak, but significant, reductions in searching efficiency were found when more than two P. tricuspis females are simultaneously ovipositing. The presence of one or two males did not appear to affect ovipositional efficiency of solitary premated females, but normally male-biased sex ratios of progeny trended toward a 1:1 ratio when the number of males was increased from zero to two. None of the linear parameters in the logistic models were significantly different from zero suggesting that P. tricuspis had constant, type 1, attack rates regardless of host density, at least under our laboratory experimental design.

The method relies upon measurement and interpretation of pond reflectance spectra spanning from the visible into the near-infrared. Reflectance spectra are acquired every 5 min with a multi-channel, fiber-coupled spectroradiometer, providing monitoring of algal pond conditions with high temporal frequency. The spectra are interpreted via numerical inversion of a reflectance model, in which the above-water reflectance is expressed in terms of the absorption and backscatter coefficients of the cultured species, with additional terms accounting for the pigment fluorescence features and for the water-surface reflection of sunlight and skylight. With this method we demonstrate detection of diatoms and the predator Poteriochromonas in outdoor cultures of Nannochloropsis oceanica and Chlorella vulgaris, respectively. The relative strength of these signatures is compared to microscopy and sequencing analysis. Spectroradiometric detection of diatoms is then further assessed on beaker-contained mixtures of Microchloropsis salina with Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Thalassiosira weissflogii, and Thalassiosira pseudonana, respectively, providing an initial evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of detecting pond competitors.","[Reichardt, Thomas A.] Sandia Natl Labs, Proliferat Signature Discovery Exploitat, Livermore, CA 94551 USA; [Maes, Danae; Jensen, Travis J.; Timlin, Jerilyn A.] Sandia Natl Labs, Mol & Microbiol, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USA; [Poorey, Kunal; Curtis, Deanna J.; Lane, Todd W.] Sandia Natl Labs, Syst Biol, Livermore, CA 94551 USA; [Dempster, Thomas A.; McGowen, John A.] Arizona State Univ, Arizona Ctr Algae Technol & Innovat AzCATI, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Jensen, Travis J.] Agilent Technol, Frederick, CO 80504 USA; [Dempster, Thomas A.] Santa Fe Community Coll, Biofuels Ctr Excellence, Santa Fe, NM 87508 USA","Timlin, JA (corresponding author), Sandia Natl Labs, Mol & Microbiol, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USA.",jatimli@sandia.gov,,"Maes, Danae/0000-0003-1065-6807","U.S. Department of Energy, Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO)United States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-EE0005996]; Algae Testbed Public Private Partnership; U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security AdministrationNational Nuclear Security Administration [DE-NA0003525];  [NL0032356]","The authors wish to thank Pierre Wensel for maintenance of the spectroradiometric equipment, Theresa Rosov for performing the microscopy and contamination counts and overseeing the cultivation experiment, Aaron Collins for his assistance with the initial set-up of the monitoring equipment at AzCATI, and Tyler Hipple for assistance with the spectroradiometric analysis of the pond data.

In this study, we investigated if and how effective this pest can be controlled in gerbera by the omnivorous predator Macrolophus pygmaeus (Rambur). Because herbivores on plants can interact through a shared predator, we also investigated how poinsettia thrips control is affected by the presence of the greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood), a pest that commonly coexists with E. americanus in gerbera. In laboratory studies, we found that the predator M. pygmaeus fed on both pests when offered together. Olfactometer tests showed a clear preference of the predators for plants infested by whiteflies but not by thrips. In a greenhouse experiment, densities of both pests on single gerbera plants were reduced to very low levels by the predator, either with both pests present together or alone. Hence, predator-mediated effects between whiteflies and thrips played only a minor role. The plant feeding of the shared predator probably reduced the dependence of predator survival and reproduction on the densities of the two pests, thereby weakening potential predator-mediated effects. Thus, M. pygmaeus is a good candidate for biological control of both pests in gerbera. However, further research is needed to investigate pest control at larger scales, when the pests can occur on different plants.","[Leman, Ada; Messelink, Gerben J.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Business Unit Greenhouse Hort, Bleiswijk, Netherlands; [Ingegno, Barbara L.; Tavella, Luciana] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Sci Agr Forestall & Alimentari DISAF, ULF Entomol Gen & Applicata, Grugliasco, TO, Italy; [Janssen, Arne] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Evolutionary & Populat Biol, IBED, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Messelink, GJ (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, BU Greenhouse Hort, POB 20, NL-2265 ZG Bleiswijk, Netherlands.",gerben.messelink@wur.nl,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009; Ingegno, Barbara Letizia/I-1619-2019","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303; Ingegno, Barbara Letizia/0000-0001-7452-5377; Messelink, Gerben J./0000-0002-5196-1229",Dutch Product Board for Horticulture; COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [FA1105],This study was funded by the Dutch Product Board for Horticulture.

Most studies on the effects of herbivory in trees rely on correlational inter-individual comparisons and could, thus, be affected by confounding factors linked to both herbivory and plant performance. Using the Mediterranean Holm oak (Quercus ilex) as a study model, we followed an experimental approach in which leaf-feeding insects (mainly Lepidoptera caterpillars) were excluded from some shoots in all study trees. Shoots subjected to herbivore exclusion exhibited lower defoliation rates and produced more acorns than control shoots. Defoliation constrained shoot growth throughout the study period, but had no effect on the number of female flowers produced per shoot. Acorn production was, however, lower in control shoots due to their higher abortion rates, and also to their greater mortality risk during summer drought, as shoots with fewer leaves were less likely to survive. Plant reaction to herbivory inhibits certain physiological pathways involved in plant growth, which, together with the effects of physical damage, reduces the amount and efficiency of the photosynthetic tissue. This increases their vulnerability to environmental stresses, such as water deficit, which limit resource assimilation. Defoliation is likely a key factor affecting oak regeneration, as it may be a significant source of seed loss prior to pre-dispersal acorn predation. Further experimental studies could help to elucidate its effects in contrasting environments. In Mediterranean regions, the harsher droughts predicted by climate change models could worsen the effects of insect herbivory on oak reproductive output.","[Canelo, Tara; Gaytan, Alvaro; Gonzalez-Bornay, Guillermo; Bonal, Raul] Univ Extremadura, Forest Res Grp, INDEHESA, Plasencia, Spain; [Bonal, Raul] Univ Castilla La Mancha, DITEG Res Grp, Toledo, Spain; [Bonal, Raul] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Catalonia, Spain","Bonal, R (corresponding author), Univ Extremadura, Forest Res Grp, INDEHESA, Ctr Univ Plasencia, Avda Virgen del Puerto 2, Plasencia 10600, Spain.",raulbonal@unex.es,"Gaytan, Alvaro/AAG-9415-2021; ramon, anna/O-1249-2019","BONAL, RAUL/0000-0002-6084-1771; Canelo, Tara/0000-0002-8831-1924; Gaytan, Alvaro/0000-0001-9827-4664","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [AGL2014-54739-R]; European Regional Development Fund (FEDER, European Union); Atraccion de Talento Investigador Programme (Gobierno de Extremadura) [TA13032]; FPI fellowship (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness) [BES-2015-071382]","This work was financed by the project AGL2014-54739-R from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER, European Union).

Post-dispersal seed predators contribute substantially to seed loss across many ecosystems. Most research has focused on understanding sources of variation in seed loss, without appreciating the implications of seed predation for plant coexistence, community assembly and broader community theory. Meanwhile, research aimed at understanding coexistence and community assembly processes in plant communities has focused on axes of dispersal and resource competition and the traits influencing these processes, without accounting for the role of generalist seed predators. 2. We review the unique features of post-dispersal seed predation and assess the implications of seed loss on three critical components of plant community organization - coexistence, community structure and plant invasions - pointing to both important gaps in theory and empirical knowledge. We highlight how understanding fundamental controls on plant recruitment is central to determining how seed predation affects plant recruitment and coexistence. We discuss how accounting for seed predator foraging strategies may shift trait-based inferences of community assembly. 3. Synthesis. We argue that seed predation by generalist consumers, which is pervasive in temperate communities, should be better incorporated into plant community theory. Experiments that specifically incorporate the presence and attributes of the seed predator community and that follow seed fate would fill important knowledge gaps. Particularly needed are studies focused on strengthening the connections between seed removal and plant establishment and linking selective and density-dependent foraging strategies to plant traits. Advancing our understanding of the processes regulating plant coexistence and community assembly requires that future research not only acknowledge but also incorporate generalist consumers' effects on plant communities.","[Larios, Loralee] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92507 USA; [Larios, Loralee; Pearson, Dean E.; Maron, John L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Missoula, MT 59801 USA","Larios, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92507 USA.; Larios, L (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",loralee.larios@ucr.edu,,,NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology Award [1309014],"We thank Phil Hahn, John Orrock, Marko Spasojevic, Lauren Waller and anonymous reviewers for constructive comments on the manuscript.

We investigated this hypothesis in Allenby's gerbils, Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi, by comparing foraging behaviors of single vs. pairs of gerbils. We recorded strong interference competition within the foraging pairs. Competition reduced the amount of time the gerbils spent foraging, as well as foraging efficiency since part of the foragers' attention was directed toward detecting competitors (apparent predation risk). Single gerbils harvested significantly more food than the combined efforts of two gerbils foraging together. Competition reduced the success of both individuals within a pair by more than 50%, making this a case of the tragedy of the commons where each individual's investment in competition reduces the success of all individuals within the group, including its own. Despite their great costs, competitive behaviors will be selected for as long as one individual achieves higher fitness than the other. In nature, interspecific interactions, such as predation risk, may act to reduce and regulate the deleterious effects of intraspecific competition.","[Berger-Tal, Oded; Embar, Keren; Kotler, Burt P.; Saltz, David] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Berger-Tal, O (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",oded.berger.tal@gmail.com,"Saltz, David/AAC-7054-2019; Berger-Tal, Oded/P-9189-2014; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012; Berger-Tal, Oded/P-1670-2019","Saltz, David/0000-0002-7437-0472; Berger-Tal, Oded/0000-0002-7396-456X; Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; Berger-Tal, Oded/0000-0002-7396-456X",Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities; ISFIsrael Science Foundation [1397/10],"We wish to dedicate this paper to Dr. Keren Embar, forever bright and cheerful, who passed away doing what she loved-science.

We tested the predictions from different defense models in tadpoles of the common frog Rana temporaria, which exhibit both types of defenses. In an outdoor experiment, we exposed the tadpoles to nonlethal predators (Aeshna dragonfly larvae) and to a gradient of intraspecific competition. Morphological responses did not follow any of the expected patterns, since investment in defense was not affected by resource level. Instead, tail depth decreased in the absence of predators. Behavioral defenses followed a state-dependent model. Overall, the defense strategy of the tadpoles revealed a shift from morphological and behavioral defenses at low tadpole density to morphological defense only at high density. This difference probably reflects the different efficiency of the defenses. Hiding is an effective means of defense, but it is unsustainable when resources are scarce. Morphological responses become more important with increasing density to compensate for the increase in behavioral risk-taking. Our results indicate that competition can strongly affect reaction norms of inducible defenses and highlight the importance of integrating ecological parameters that affect the cost-benefit balance of phenotypic plasticity.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Teplitsky, C (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biol Sci, Viikinkaari 1 Bioctr 3, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",Celine.Teplitsky@helsinki.fi,"Teplitsky, Celine/H-3621-2019","Teplitsky, Celine/0000-0001-9458-709X",,,,50,28,28,3,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2007,88,7,,,,,1641,1646,,10.1890/06-1703.1,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,185SN,WOS:000247730800004,17645010,,,,2021-09-27,

We performed a whole-lake experiment by stocking a non-native top predator (pikeperch (Sander lucioperca)) to two residential piscivores (Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) and northern pike (Esox lucius)). By analyzing spatial distribution, diet composition, growth, and consumption rates of the piscivores before and after pikeperch introduction, we tested how both density-dependent and trait-mediated responses affected interactions between the three predators. Total piscivore biomass increased 1.5 times and annual consumption by the piscivores increased 1.7 times after stocking, attributable to the stocked pikeperch and increased northern pike abundances. Abundance, distribution, and consumption data indicated that northern pike was hardly affected by pikeperch stocking and even increased its biomass, whereas piscivorous perch shifted its habitat use towards the littoral lake areas in response to competition with pikeperch. Furthermore, all piscivores increasingly fed on small perch. The forced habitat shift of piscivorous perch in combination with increased predation on small perch led to a decreased abundance of large perch, attributable to the compensatory effects of intraguild predation and cannibalism.","Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, D-12561 Berlin, Germany; Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, D-12561 Berlin, Germany; Univ Constance, Inst Limnol, Dept Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany","Schulze, T (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Inst Hydrobiol & Aquat Ecosyst Management, Dept Water Atmosphere & Environm, Max Emanuel Str 17, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",torsten.schulze@igb-berlin.de,"Holker, Franz/A-5683-2009; Mehner, Thomas/B-8665-2008","Holker, Franz/0000-0001-5932-266X; Mehner, Thomas/0000-0002-3619-165X",,,,63,28,28,1,33,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

The second experiment differed by the inclusion of fish in the ponds. 3 In the first year DIC had no effect on plant growth, but nutrient loading did. Plants failed to grow in treatments where phytoplankton density was high (>100 mug L1). Where phytoplankton was low, high numbers of invertebrates colonized the ponds, and periphyton abundance on the plants was low. In the second year, where phytoplankton never achieved the densities of the previous year, there was a significant effect of DIC concentration on plant growth but not of nutrients. Invertebrate abundance was lower and periphyton on the plants correspondingly higher. 4 In both years increased nutrient loading had no effect on the abundance of periphyton growing on the surface of the plants. Periphyton abundance was determined by the density of grazing invertebrates in the ponds. 5 There was a negative relationship between periphyton density and final plant density, which became significantly less steep with increasing DIC, indicating that periphyton and plants were competing for carbon. 6 DIC concentration has the potential to influence community structure in shallow lakes, altering competitive interactions between periphyton and plants and rendering low DIC lakes more prone to loss of plants when nutrient loading increases. However, the expression of this competition between periphyton and plants will depend on the density of grazing invertebrates present, which is itself influenced by the intensity of fish predation on those invertebrates.","Univ Liverpool, Sch Biol Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England","Jones, JI (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, London E1 4NS, England.",J.IJones@qmw.ac.uk,,"Jones, John Iwan/0000-0002-7238-2509",,,,62,117,148,2,78,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

As group size increases, however, competition for resources may also increase, resulting in a decrease in the quantity of resources available to each member of the group. When resources are scarce, individuals might be expected to increase their foraging effort in an attempt to increase their share. Such increases in effort will often appear to increase an individual's risk of predation. Thus, increased competition may contribute to the frequently observed relationship between risk-taking behaviour and group size. To date, no experimental assessment of the relative importance of these Two mechanisms exists. We argue;that to differentiate between the hypotheses of 'risk reduction' and 'increased competition', it is necessary to quantify the effect of predation risk on the form of the relationship between group size and risk-taking behaviour, and thus, to manipulate both group size and predation risk. We conducted an experiment to determine the relative importance of risk reduction and increased competition to the foraging decisions of juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch. We recorded the foraging behaviour of 18 focal individuals in the presence and absence of a predator, and in the company of zero, one and three conspecifics. As group size increased from one to four, focal fish captured more prey items, ventured closer to the feeder (and predator) to intercept them, and decreased their use of cover. Furthermore, although focal individuals captured fewer prey items and intercepted them further from the feeder in the presence of the predator than in its absence, the form of the relationship between risk-taking behaviour and group size was not affected by the level of predation risk. The results of our experiment are consistent with the interpretation that increases in risk-taking behaviour with group size occurred primarily as a consequence of increased competition for scarce resources.

Individuals varied significantly both in their feeding rate when alone and in the decline in that feeding rate in the presence of competitors. Individuals that had high absolute feeding rates did not tend to have smaller declines in feeding rate in the presence of competitors.

Each stream contained nine channel-spanning blocks (22.5 x 22.5 x 4 cm) spaced 22.5 cm apart and was illuminated with a photon flux density of 375, 90 or 20-mu-E m-2 s-2. We monitored periphyton succession and the number of snails in fast current regimes on tops of blocks (exposed substrata) and in slower current regimes on surfaces recessed between blocks (sheltered substrata). At the end of the experiment, algal biomass in streams illuminated with high irradiance was approximately 80x and 8x greater than in streams with low and intermediate irradiance, respectively. Growth rates of Juga in streams with high and intermediate irradiances were similar and approximately 15x greater than rates at low irradiance. At all irradiances, snail densities were higher and algal biomass was lower on sheltered substrata than on exposed substrata. As algal biomass became low on sheltered substrata, snails tended to be more abundant on exposed substrata, and biomass values in the two current regimes became more similar. Differences in algal biomass and snail abundance between the two substrata were greater in streams illuminated with high irradiance than for the two lower irradiances. Algal assemblages with low irradiance contained adnate cell forms early in succession. At intermediate irradiance, succession in both current regimes moved towards adnate cells, but this occurred more rapidly on the more heavily grazed sheltered substrata. At high irradiance, parts of the algal assemblages in both current regimes remained ungrazed, producing a mix of successional stages on the substrata. Similar interactions may occur in coastal Oregon (USA) streams, because Juga is the competitive dominant herbivore with few predators, and its distribution corresponds mainly to irradiance (as one of the major determinants of algal abundance), current regime, and substratum size.",,"DENICOLA, DM (corresponding author), UNIV NEBRASKA,DEPT FORESTRY FISHERIES & WILDLIFE,101 PLANT IND,LINCOLN,NE 68583, USA.",,,,,,,0,38,40,0,5,NORTH AMER BENTHOLOGICAL SOC,LAWRENCE,"1041 NEW HAMSPHIRE STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",0887-3593,,,J N AM BENTHOL SOC,J.

Decomposition of dead organic matter is a key ecological process that ensures soil formation, nutrient availability, and carbon sequestration. To gain understanding of how biodiversity and ecosystems function together to control leaf-litter decomposition processes in a tropical rain forest (Yasuni National Park, Ecuador), we predicted the consequences of the decomposition process using a protocol in which we systematically disassemble the structural functionality of the soil macrofauna communities. We (1) describe the structure and function of the edaphic communities in detail and (2) explore the functional consequences of structural changes in these communities using a non-random exclusion experiment to simulate body size-related extinctions. To do this, we manipulated access of five size classes of soil invertebrates to eight types of plant leaf-litter resources. After measuring and identifying about 4400 soil individuals belonging to 541 morphospecies, 12 functional groups, and following the fate of about 2000 tree leaves in a 50-ha plot, we showed that (1) soil invertebrate communities were composed of a few common and many rare morphospecies that included mostly leaf-litter transformer groups, with the most morphospecies and the greatest abundance coming from Hymenoptera, Collembola, and Coleoptera; (2) our survey captured 63-74% of the total soil biodiversity of the study area (meaning there may be up to 860 morphospecies); (3) litter transformers covered the widest range of body volume, and all groups were evenly distributed at small and large spatial scales (i.e., we found no patterns of spatial aggregation); (4) changes in food web structure significantly altered biomass loss for only three of the eight leaf-litter treatments, suggesting the decomposition process was highly resistant to drastic changes such as size-biased biodiversity loss independent of resource quality. We conclude organic matter decomposition may depend on all non-additive effects that arise from multi-species interactions, including facilitation, interspecific interference competition, and top-down control that predators exert over detritivores at all body size ranges.","[Cardenas, Rafael E.; Argoti, Adriana; Dangles, Olivier] Pontificia Univ Catolica Ecuador, Escuela Ciencias Biol, Museo Zool QCAZ, Lab Entomol, Av 12 Octubre 1076 & Roca,Apdo 17-01-2184, Quito, Ecuador; [Cardenas, Rafael E.; Dangles, Olivier] LEGS CNRS, IRD, UPR 9034, UR 072, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Cardenas, Rafael E.; Dangles, Olivier] Univ Paris Sud 11, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Donoso, David A.] Escuela Politec Nacl, Inst Ciencias Biol, Av Ladron Guevara E11-253, Quito, Ecuador","Cardenas, RE (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Ecuador, Escuela Ciencias Biol, Museo Zool QCAZ, Lab Entomol, Av 12 Octubre 1076 & Roca,Apdo 17-01-2184, Quito, Ecuador.; Cardenas, RE (corresponding author), LEGS CNRS, IRD, UPR 9034, UR 072, F-91198 Gif Sur Yvette, France.; Cardenas, RE (corresponding author), Univ Paris Sud 11, F-91405 Orsay, France.",recardenasm@yahoo.com,"Cardenas, Rafael E/AAY-9755-2020; Donoso, David A/A-2059-2016","Donoso, David A/0000-0002-3408-1457; Cardenas, Rafael E./0000-0002-0375-9384","French Institute for Research and Development (IRD); SENESCYT/ Prometeo Project [20140548BP]; PUCE [I13045, J13041]","The PUCE (codes I13045 and J13041) and the French Institute for Research and Development (IRD) supported this study through research grants.

Ascidian tunicates contain various toxins and seldom suffer from predation by reef fishes, except for boxfishes. However, the importance of ascidian tunicates has not been sufficiently examined in the feeding ecology of boxfishes. We conducted field surveys to investigate the feeding habits of the white-spotted boxfish Ostracion meleagris on the reefs of southern Japan. Photosymbiotic ascidians predominantly contributed to the boxfish diet, and observed colonies of ascidians were bitten frequently by the boxfish during the survey. During the day, the feeding boxfish moved within their home ranges in a rocky, shallow zone of the studied reefs, which harbored photosymbiotic ascidian colonies of the family Didemnidae at higher densities than in the surrounding zones, including the spawning sites that were located hundreds of meters offshore. Boxfish home ranges overlapped considerably, but intraspecific agonistic interactions rarely occurred among the females, likely due to the abundance of ascidian colonies. No other types of fish were observed to make attempts to feed on the ascidian colonies on the reef throughout the study period, except for a congener Ostracion cubicus. These results suggest that the boxfish strongly rely on the photosymbiotic ascidians as a less-competitive food resource, and the limited distribution pattern of photosymbiotic ascidians in shallow water near shore can be an important factor in promoting a spawning migration in the boxfish.","[Koide, Yuki; Sakai, Yoichi] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biosphere Sci, Kagamiyama 1-4-4, Higashihiroshima 7398528, Japan; [Sakai, Yoichi] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Sci Life, Kagamiyama 1-4-4, Higashihiroshima 7398528, Japan","Koide, Y (corresponding author), Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biosphere Sci, Kagamiyama 1-4-4, Higashihiroshima 7398528, Japan.",koideyyyyy@gmail.com,,,"Hiroshima University Animal Research Committee [020A170410]; Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour; Ichthyological Society of Japan; Japan Ethological Society - Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from the Japan Science Society; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [18K06419]","We thank the people of Kuchierabu-jima Island for allowing us to perform the field survey.

This study provides a detailed description of the life cycle and shelter-building process of caterpillars, and identifies constraints and factors influencing this adaptive behavior in Lepidomys n. sp. near proclea Druce (Pyralidae: Chrysauginae), a tropical dry forest pyralid. Five macroscopic larval instars were detected during the life cycle, and activities performed during shelter-building were categorized and timed. Caterpillar predators were identified, and 20% of all collected larvae died due to attack by parasitoid wasps. Shelter-building behavior was found to be constrained by the ontogenetic stage of caterpillars and influenced by leaf size of the host plant, Piper stipulaceum Opiz (Piperales: Piperaceae). A similar pattern of shelter-building behavior exhibited by Tosale n. sp. near cuprealis larvae that coexisted in the same host plant is also described. Larvae of the second species were significantly less abundant than those of Lepidomys and hatched one month later in the rainy season, which could indicate some competitive interactions between these two pyralid species.","[Abarca, Mariana; Boege, Karina] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Dept Ecol Evolut, Inst Ecol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Abarca, Mariana] George Washington Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Zaldivar-Riveron, Alejandro] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Coleccion Nacl Insectos, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Boege, K (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Dept Ecol Evolut, Inst Ecol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",maz@gwmail.gwu.edu; kboege@servidor.unam.mx; azaldivar@ibunam2.ibiologia.unam.mx,"Abarca, Mariana/T-7334-2019; Pare, Karina Boege/AAP-9596-2021","Abarca, Mariana/0000-0002-6944-2574; ","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (Spain)Spanish Government [CGL2010-15786]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT, Mexico)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [511]; CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)","We thank B.

It addresses poorly researched areas with good habitat potential for the only three cetacean subspecies living in this area: the Black Sea short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis spp. ponticus), the Black Sea bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus spp. ponticus) and the Black Sea harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena spp. relicta). Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to analyse data collected from multiple sources. In total, 745 sightings of the three species between 1998 and 2010 throughout the Black Sea were included. The analysis found depth and sea surface temperature to be the most important variables for separating the occurrence of the three species. Common dolphins occurred mainly in deep waters and in areas where the sea surface temperature was low, bottlenose dolphins were distributed primarily in shallower and warmer waters than common dolphins, and harbour porpoises were distributed in shallower waters with lower sea surface temperature than bottlenose dolphins. This study suggests strong niche segregation among the three cetacean species. The study is also the first contribution to the basic information of cetacean species distribution and habitat preferences in the Black Sea as a whole. Knowledge of the distribution of the three dolphin species in the study area is essential to establish conservation measures for these populations.","[Sanchez-Cabanes, Alicia; Nimak-Wood, Maja; Harris, Nicola] Gardline Environm Ltd, Marine Wildlife Dept, Endeavour House,Admiralty Rd, Great Yarmouth NR30 3NG, Norfolk, England; [de Stephanis, Renaud] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, GEMA, C Amer Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [de Stephanis, Renaud] CIRCE, Cabeza de Manzaneda 3, Algeciras 11390, Spain","Sanchez-Cabanes, A (corresponding author), Gardline Environm Ltd, Marine Wildlife Dept, Endeavour House,Admiralty Rd, Great Yarmouth NR30 3NG, Norfolk, England.",alicia.sanchez-cabanes@gardline.com; maja.nimak-wood@gardline.com; Nicola.harris@gardline.com; renauddestephanis@gmail.com,"de Stephanis, Renaud/AAA-5682-2019","Sanchez-Cabanes, Alicia/0000-0001-9018-1156; de Stephanis, Renaud/0000-0003-2522-7933",Gardline Environmental Ltd.; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas),"This study was funded by Gardline Environmental Ltd.

One common means employed to recover prey populations is that of translocations, but most fail owing to high predation during the early stages. We tested whether conditioned odor aversion can reduce predation during animal translocations by using the predation of the European rabbitOryctolagus cuniculusby the red foxVulpes vulpesas a case study. Following a before-after control-impact design (BACI), we deployed bait stations monitored using camera-traps in two zones to which rabbits were translocated. One week before the rabbits were released, microencapsulated levamisole was added to rabbit baits located in the treatment zones, along with vanilla essence as an odor cue. A total of 148 rabbits were distributed in artificial warrens with the odor cue and 68 of them were fitted with radio collars in order to determine their survival rates. The response to the treatment and translocation as regards subsequent rabbit abundance was evaluated using N-mixture models, while rabbit establishment was evaluated using a warren use index (WUI). The treatment decreased the proportion of baits consumed by foxes, but this decrease was partially compensated by other predators. WUI and rabbit population growth increased significantly more after translocations in the treatment zones than in the control zones. The short-term survival of translocated rabbits was also higher in the treatment zones than in the control zones. Our study showed that conditioned odor aversion reduced rabbit predation by foxes, and had a positive effect on rabbit population growth after translocation, since there was an increase in rabbit survival and warren establishment. This method could be used as a non-lethal tool for the recovery of a key prey when carrying out programs concerning the reintroduction of endangered predators or for other vulnerable species requiring translocations.","[Tobajas, J.; Descalzo, E.; Jimenez, J.; Mateo, R.; Ferreras, P.] CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC, Ronda de Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain; [Villafuerte, R.] Inst Estudios Sociales Avanzados IESA CSIC, Campo Santo de los Martires 7, Cordoba 14004, Spain","Tobajas, J (corresponding author), CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC, Ronda de Toledo 12, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain.",jtobajas47@gmail.com,"Mateo, Rafael/A-3117-2011; Jimenez, Jose/I-9840-2019; Villafuerte, Rafael/L-8715-2013","Mateo, Rafael/0000-0003-1307-9152; Jimenez, Jose/0000-0003-0607-6973; Descalzo, Esther/0000-0002-0809-4422; Villafuerte, Rafael/0000-0001-7582-4299; Tobajas, Jorge/0000-0002-8329-8265","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2013-40975-R, CGL2013-43197-R]; FPI PhD scholarship - Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2014-068987]","This study has been possible as a result of the CGL2013-40975-R and CGL2013-43197-R projects, from the I+D+I National Plan funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.

There is, however, some debate as to the actual mechanisms producing these unhealthy trees. To investigate further some of the processes that may be contributing to this form of canopy dieback, two field trials were carried out in Olney State Forest, near Wyong, New South Wales. The study site contained Eucalyptus saligna (Sydney blue gum) with canopy dieback and was occupied by a large colony of bell miners. Close examination of the foliage revealed a large and diverse suite of phytophagous insects, including at least 16 species of psyllid (Hemiptera: Psyllidae). In the first trial, the use of bird exclusion cages over selected branches significantly improved leaf survival compared to leaves exposed to a relatively high density of bell miners. It is proposed thar colonization by bell miners may interfere with the efficacy of both other insectivorous birds (through aggressive interspecific territoriality) and the invertebrate predators and parasitoids. Interference with such regulatory factors may enable some phytophagous insect populations To rise to sustained damaging levels. In the second trial, an insecticide application combined. with reduced competition from the dense understorey and neighbouring trees was required to significantly improve trunk diameter and crown condition scores. After 12 months, neither treatment, by itself, significantly improved both growth measures. Possibly both treatments were required because the E. saligna trees were suffering from another source of stress (e.g. drought) in addition to the relatively high level of insect attack.",,"Stone, C (corresponding author), STATE FORESTS NEW S WALES,DIV RES,POB 100,BEECROFT,NSW 2119,AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,34,29,33,0,18,BLACKWELL SCIENCE,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0307-692X,,,AUST J ECOL,Aust.

Size and shell species preferences of the hermit crab Calcinus tibicen were determined for the three most occupied [Stramonita haemastoma (Linnaeus, 1767), Leucozonia nassa (Gmelin, 1791) and Pisania auritula (Link, 1807)] shell species along the rocky shore of Grande beach, Ubatuba, Brazil, taking into account the sexual condition of the individuals. All experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions using a glass aquarium where the hermit crabs (independent on their sex condition) were placed naked with a large number of shells of appropriate sizes. The chosen shells were determined after 72 h. The preferred shell species and size were determined by regression analysis. C. tibicen showed no significant choice among the three gastropod shell species. Shell size experiments revealed that the preference of hermit crabs was strongly associated with shell weight and internal volume. The shell adequacy index (SAD decreased with increasing crab size and showed that the population was occupying relatively adequate shells (SAI = 0.99 +/- 0.19). The present data lead us to conclude that shell selection by hermit crabs involves individual and sexual preferences taking into account the shell features that best provide protection and survival, principally in the rocky inter-tidal studied area, characterized by intense wave action.

Few studies, however, simultaneously quantify the impacts of multiple herbivore guilds on the lifetime performance or population growth rate of plants. In African savannas, large ungulates (such as elephants) are widely regarded as important drivers of woody plant population dynamics, while the potential impacts of smaller, more cryptic herbivores (such as rodents) have largely been ignored. We combined a large-scale ungulate exclusion experiment with a five-year manipulation of rodent densities to quantify the impacts of three herbivore guilds (wild ungulates, domestic cattle, and rodents) on all life stages of a widespread savanna tree. We utilized demographic modeling to reveal the overall role of each guild in regulating tree population dynamics, and to elucidate the importance of different demographic hurdles in driving population growth under contrasting consumer communities. We found that wild ungulates dramatically reduced population growth, shifting the population trajectory from increase to decline, but that the mechanisms driving these effects were strongly mediated by rodents. The impact of wild ungulates on population growth was predominantly driven by their negative effect on tree reproduction when rodents were excluded, and on adult tree survival when rodents were present. By limiting seedling survival, rodents also reduced population growth; however, this effect was strongly dampened where wild ungulates were present. We suggest that these complex interactions between disparate consumer guilds can have important consequences for the population demography of long-lived species, and that the effects of a single consumer group are often likely to vary dramatically depending on the larger community in which interactions are embedded.","[Maclean, Janet E.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Maclean, Janet E.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Maclean, Janet E.; Goheen, Jacob R.; Doak, Daniel F.; Palmer, Todd M.; Young, Truman P.] Mpala Res Ctr, Nanyuki, Kenya; [Goheen, Jacob R.; Doak, Daniel F.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Goheen, Jacob R.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Bot, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Palmer, Todd M.] Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Young, Truman P.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Maclean, JE (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",maclean@zoology.ubc.ca,,"Palmer, Todd/0000-0001-5710-9750","American Society of Mammalogists; University of British Columbia; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute; U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0827610, DEB 0934734]; Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Institution; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [4691-91]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [LTREB BSR-97-07477, 03-16402, 08-12824, 08-16453]; U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service [98210-0-G563]","We thank Abdikadir Ali Hassan and Simon Lima for field assistance.

We also examined the relationship between aspen recovery and the distribution of Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) and bison (Bison bison) on the Yellowstone northern ungulate winter range, using ungulate fecal pile densities and annual elk count data. In 1998, 90% of young aspen were browsed and none were taller than 200 cm, the height at which aspen begin to escape from elk browsing. In 2012, only 37% in the east and 63% in the west portions of the winter range were browsed, and 65% of stands in the east had young aspen taller than 200 cm. Heights of young aspen were inversely related to browsing intensity, with the least browsing and greatest heights in the eastern portion of the range, corresponding with recent changes in elk density and distribution. In contrast with historical elk distribution (1930s-1990s), the greatest densities of elk recently (2006-2012) have been north of the park boundary (similar to 5 elk/km(2)), and in the western part of the range (2-4 elk/km(2)), with relatively few elk in the eastern portion of the range (<2 elk/km(2)), even in mild winters. This redistribution of elk and decrease in density inside the park, and overall reduction in elk numbers, explain why many aspen stands have begun to recover. Increased predation pressure following the reintroduction of gray wolves (Canis lupus) in 1995-1996 played a role in these changing elk population dynamics, interacting with other influences including increased predation by bears (Ursus spp.), competition with an expanding bison population, and shifting patterns of human land use and hunting outside the park. The resulting new aspen recruitment is evidence of a landscape-scale trophic cascade in which a resurgent large carnivore community, combined with other ecological changes, has benefited aspen through effects on ungulate prey.","[Painter, Luke E.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Beschta, Robert L.; Ripple, William J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Larsen, Eric J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog & Geol, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA","Painter, LE (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",luke.painter@oregonstate.edu,"Ripple, William/ABE-9353-2020",,University of Wyoming-National Park Service Research Station,"We received financial support from the University of Wyoming-National Park Service Research Station.

In the field population. maximum juvenile abundance coincided seasonally with high phytoflagellate concentration. During the clear-water phase (a seasonal period of low algal density), D. thomasi disappeared from the water column, but fourth-instar copepodids (CIV) were found encysted in developmental arrest in the sediment. Laboratory assays of the effect of the density of two types of food on copepod life history parameters showed that temporal variation in the concentration of relatively small phytoflagellates significantly affected stage-specific development times. This food limitation was most pronounced during the clear-water phase, and supplementation of the diet with a laboratory-cultured phytoflagellate, Chlamydomonas, prevented food limitation. Although developmental arrest appears to be controlled primarily by photoperiod, availability of the larger, more mobile food, Euglena, also influenced the percentage of individuals entering developmental arrest in the laboratory. An investigation of the spatial and temporal emergence pattern in the field revealed that CIV copepodids started to emerge in late autumn and that emergence rates were significantly greater at deepwater locations (9-12 m water depth) compared with shallow-water locations (5-7 m). The clear-water phase in Oneida Lake is an annual event. probably produced by intense grazing by Daphnia pulicaria and Daphnia galeata. Food limitation is thus very likely a recurrent phenomenon for D, thomasi. This apparent seasonal competitive impact of Daphnia on Diacyclops affects both nauplii and immature copepodids. Diacyclops shows two types of responses to the food limitation: (1) the physiological response of slowed active development, and (2) the adaptive response of developmental arrest.","Odense Univ, Inst Biol, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; Cornell Univ, Div Biol Sci, Ecol & Systemat Sect, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Hansen, AM (corresponding author), Odense Univ, Inst Biol, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",amha@dou.dk,,,,,,66,28,30,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,1998,115,3,,,,,320,330,,10.1007/s004420050523,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,101PM,WOS:000074877400005,28308422,,,,2021-09-27,

For each species the population density, number and size of leaves and the number of flowers were measured. 2 Both species responded more strongly to fertilizer addition than to the exclusion of herbivores. Mertensia produced more flowering stems, more leaves per stem, and stem density increased in the fertilized plots. Fertilizing increased total leaf length per plant for non-flowering stems but this was not observed for flowering stems. However, the net effect of having more flowering stems and having greater leaf area on nonflowering stems was to increase the total leaf area of the population. The responses of Mertensia make it likely to become a stronger competitor in a more productive plant community. 3 Anemone showed contrasting responses at both individual and population levels. While individual stems produced slightly more leaves in fertilized plots, the density of stems declined. There were no strong effects on either leaf size or flowering. There was evidence of higher leaf turnover in fertilized plants. Meanwhile, control and exclosed unfertilized plots showed an increase in population density. 4 The weak responses to herbivory may be explained by the timing; this part of the experiment was run during a period of declining herbivore activity. However, observed interaction effects suggest that those herbivores remaining ill the system may be attracted to fertilized plots. It is planned to continue the experiment for at least another 5 years through, and beyond, the next hare peak.","UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA, DEPT BOT, VANCOUVER, BC V6T 1Z4, CANADA",,,,"John, Elizabeth/0000-0001-9281-536X",,,,46,31,32,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Recent ecosystem-level shifts engendering considerable economic losses have validated this concern, positioning bistability at the vanguard of coupled human-environment systems management. While the perturbations that induce regime shifts are known, the ecological forces that uphold alternative stable states are often unresolved or complex and system specific. Thus, the search continues for general mechanisms that can produce alternative stable states under realistic conditions. Integrating model predictions with long-term zooplankton community experiments, we show that the core feature of ontogenetic development, food-dependent maturation, enables a single community to reach different configurations within the same constant environment. In one configuration, predators regulate prey to foster coexistence, while in the other, prey counterintuitively exclude their predators via maturation-limiting competition. The concordance of these findings with the unique outcome and underlying mechanism of a general model provides empirical evidence that developmental change, a fundamental property of life, can support bistability of natural systems.","[Toscano, Benjamin J.] Trinity Coll, Dept Biol, Hartford, CT 06106 USA; [Toscano, Benjamin J.; Rudolf, Volker H.

Of these ponds, c. 40 are known to have contained C. carassius during the 1970s1980s. In the initial and validation studies, C. carassius were found in only 11 of these ponds, yielding declines of 76% (five of 21 ponds) and 68% (six of 19 ponds), respectively (72% decline overall). Non-native cyprinids, including goldfish Carassius auratus and common carp Cyprinus carpio and their hybrids with C. carassius, were observed in 20% of the ponds. Causes of C. carassius local extinction from 21 ponds were confidently determined as desiccation due to drought, terrestrialization and habitat deterioration, hybridization and competition with non-native cyprinids, agricultural land reclamation and predation (after the introduction of pike Esox lucius). This study led to C. carassius being designated as a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) species in the county of Norfolk, the first formal conservation designation for the species in the U.K. The C. carassius BAP plan aims to halt the decline of this much overlooked species through reintroductions and selective stocking of suitable ponds within the native range of the species.","[Copp, G.

To explain these landscape differences several hypotheses have been proposed, e.g. differences in habitat quality, inter- and intra-specific competition, predation and food abundance. How breeding performance of birds within remnants of natural vegetation in urban areas is affected by adjacent matrix has been less studied. We performed an experimental study in four urban woodlands surrounded by three types of habitat matrix: residential, high-rise building and grassland/golf course. We placed 300 nest boxes for tits (great tit Parus major and blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus) in 15 transects that were 200 m long, extending from the adjacent matrix 150 m into urban woodland. Density of breeding great tit pairs was highest in residential areas and hatch date was earlier in the residential habitat compared to the other two habitats, however, nestling condition was lower in residential areas. Hatching date was earlier but hatching spread (heaviest nestling/lightest nestling) higher in the three types of urban matrix than inside the urban woodlands. In contrast to previous large-scale comparisons of urban and rural matrix, we almost exclusively found differences in qualitative measures (nestling condition and hatchling spread) at the small scale in which this study was conducted.

This issue is important because it might strongly affect climate reconstructions derived from biota assemblages such as chironomids. Head capsule larval remains of chironomids have been studied in a 660 years lacustrine sedimentary sequence from Lake Azul (Sao Miguel Island, Azores archipelago) to assess the extent and timescale of the effect of the predator introduction occurring in this historically fishless lake. Analysis of similarity showed that the chironomid assemblage was statistically different before and after predator introduction (R = 0.78; p < 0.001). Abundance of chironomids was about 40% greater in the fishless lake period compared to the period in the presence of predator. Results show major change in chironomid assemblage coinciding with the first time of goldfish introduction (around 1790 CE), followed by carp (1890 CE) and pike (1979 CE) introductions. The composition of feeding group guilds changed following a pattern characterized by a decrease in abundance of detritivorous and predaceous taxa and an increase in abundance of grazing chironomid taxa. This study suggests that predator introduction was the most important factor affecting the chironomid assemblages in this natural, Azorean fishless lake, but predators did not affect all chironomid species. Other external forcings like major climate oscillations, anthropogenic activities in the catchment basin, and volcanic eruptions seem to play an additional role.

However, we know little about how community processes, such as competition and predation, influence susceptibility to contaminants or how different types of contaminants shape communities. The objective of our study was to determine how realistic concentrations of the herbicide atrazine and the insecticide endosulfan influence the structure of a pond community when the presence of common community members was manipulated. We employed a factorial design in mesocosms to evaluate the effects of pesticide treatments (25 mu g/L of atrazine, 10 mu g/L of endosulfan, solvent control; two pulses separated by two weeks) and the presence or absence of wood frog tadpoles (Rana sylvatica), adult snails (Planorbella trivolvis), and caged dragonfly larvae (Anax junius) on a freshwater community. Tadpoles, snails, and chironomid larvae, Polypedilum sp. (Dipterans), all competed for periphyton. As a result, tadpoles reduced the survival, mass, and reproduction of snails; snails reduced the growth, development, inactivity, and dragonfly avoidance of tadpoles; snails and tadpoles reduced the abundance of chironomid larvae; and chironomid larvae reduced snail mass. The adverse effect of snails on tadpole growth and behavior was greater in the presence of the caged tadpole predator, A. junius. Neither pesticide affected dragonfly survival, but endosulfan directly reduced zooplankton (Daphnia), and atrazine indirectly reduced chironomid abundance. Atrazine also directly decreased periphyton, and endosulfan decimated chironomid larvae, resulting in indirect increases and decreases in competition for both snails and tadpoles, respectively. Consequently, relative to endosulfan, atrazine tended to decrease snail mass and reproduction and. reduce tadpole mass, development, inactivity, refuge use, and dragonfly avoidance. However, the indirect effects of pesticides depended upon the presence of heterospecifics. The indirect benefit of endosulfan on snail mass was greater in the presence of caged dragonfly larvae, and endosulfan's indirect benefit on tadpole mass was greater in the absence of snails. The effect of pesticides on tadpole activity depended on both caged dragonflies and snails. Thus, environmentally realistic concentrations of pesticides directly and indirectly shaped species responses and community composition, but the initial composition of the community influenced these pesticide effects. These results emphasize the importance of quantifying the effects of contaminants within complex natural communities.","Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Rohr, JR (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, Penn State Inst Environm, 501 ASI Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jrohr@uky.edu,"Crumrine, Patrick W/I-7975-2016; Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021","Crumrine, Patrick W/0000-0002-5752-8231; ",,,,72,173,178,5,118,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Pomacea canaliculata (family Ampullariidae), an invasive apple snail native to the Pampas ecoregion, acts as a voracious grazer and plays a structuring role on submerged macrophytes that serve as food, habitat or foraging ground for many macroinvertebrates. Laboratory studies show that P. canaliculata can also act as a competitor or predator of other macroinvertebrates. Using a mesocosm approach, we sought to investigate if this species of apple snail affects other freshwater snails (Chilina parchappii, Heleobia parchappii, Biomphalaria peregrina and Melanoides tuberculata) as well as other macroinvertebrates and if consumption of submerged macrophytes and detritus mediates these effects. After twelve weeks we estimated in mesocosms with and without apple snails the abundance of snails and macroinvertebrates through samples taken separately from sediment and from macrophytes. We also estimated the coverage and biomass of macrophytes and the detritus biomass. Significantly lower abundance occurred in mesocosms with apple snails for all snail species and representative macroinvertebrates (i.e., Hirudinea, Ephemeroptera, Chironomidae and Odonata). Mesocosms with apple snails also resulted in lower total abundance of macroinvertebrates. We speculate that the negative effects of P. canaliculata on most other snails and macroinvertebrates living on macrophytes relates to their grazing on detritus and macrophytes. In contrast, the density of snails and macroinvertebrates in the samples from sediments were not affected by P. canaliculata. One snail species and Ephemeroptera were negatively affected by mechanisms not related to the reduction in macrophyte biomass and detritus. A decrease in the microhabitats provided by macrophytes probably mediated the negative effects on Odonata nymphs. The reduction in the abundances of snails and macroinvertebrates caused by P. canaliculata may have cascading effects on higher trophic levels in waterbodies from Southern Pampas but also in invaded regions.","[Maldonado, Mara A.; Manara, Enzo; Martin, Pablo R.] Univ Nacl Sur, INBIOSUR, CONICET, San Juan 671, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Martin, Pablo R.] Univ Nacl Sur, Dept Biol Bioquim & Farm, Lab Ecol, San Juan 670, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Martin, PR (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Sur, INBIOSUR, CONICET, San Juan 671, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",pmartin@criba.edu.ar,,,UNS (Universidad Nacional del Sur) [PGI 24/B232]; ANPCyT (Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica)ANPCyT [PICT 2012-1956],"This work was funded with grants from UNS (Universidad Nacional del Sur, PGI 24/B232) and ANPCyT (Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica, PICT 2012-1956).

In aquatic environments such signals take varied and conflicting forms including chemical cues indicating food or potential mates being opposed by the presence of competitor or predator odour. Despite ever increasing knowledge of the chemical nature of signalling compounds, little is known of how the environment affects an animal's response towards such infochemicals. We examined how the European shore crab, Carcinus maenas, changes its behaviour in relation to recent social interactions. We hypothesized that agonistic encounters would affect males' behaviour towards two chemical signals: the female sex pheromone cue and a feeding odour (mussel-infused water). In a laboratory experiment, agonistic encounters significantly increased males' response times to food stimuli regardless of their dominance status. Additionally, after an aggressive interaction, 40% of subordinate males failed to respond, and both winners and losers showed a delayed response, to the female sex pheromone. Status-dependent responses by males are potential signs of social structures, enabling them to use social hierarchy-driven mating tactics. This could reduce the number and intensity of costly fights during the short reproductive window. This is a rare example of social interactions directly affecting an animal's response to chemical cues for feeding and reproduction, opening the field for further studies on the complexity of chemical communication.

Predation is intense on coral reefs where competition for limited space and food is severe. The sea urchin Diadema antillarum, an inhabitant of Caribbean coral reefs, uses crevice shelters and often aggregates with conspecifics for protection against predators, which appears to reflect a conflicting balance between group defense versus competition for limited shelter. A series of laboratory experiments was used to determine how the availability of shelter, conspecifics, and chemical odors from conspecifics and a predator-the spotted spiny lobster (Panulirus guttatus)-affect D. antillarum shelter use. The long-spined sea urchin D. antillarum responded strongly to the odor of conspecifics and the lobster predator. Absent the threat of predation, D. antillarum compete for shelter and avoid shelters bearing the scent of other urchins. But, D. antillarum readily shared shelters and preferred the scent of conspecifics when exposed to lobster odors. Thus, efforts to enhance the recovery of D. antillarum populations on degraded reefs must strike a balance between minimizing their mortality from predation and increasing habitat complexity, which not only increases shelter for D. antillarum, but also their predators.","[Kintzing, Meredith D.; Butler, Mark J.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA","Butler, MJ (corresponding author), Old Dominion Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",mbutler@odu.edu,,,PADI Project Aware; PADI Foundation; Mote Protect Our Reefs Program; Old Dominion University Dominion Scholars Program; Florida Sea Grant [R/LR-B-61]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BIO OCE - 0452383],"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding for this research from PADI Project Aware, the PADI Foundation, Mote Protect Our Reefs Program, the Old Dominion University Dominion Scholars Program, Florida Sea Grant (R/LR-B-61), and the National Science Foundation (BIO OCE - 0452383).

We used a combination of sampling and field experiments to evaluate the effect of microenvironmental changes produced by plant cover on the distribution of the burrowing crab Chasmagnathus granulata, a dominant macroinvertebrate of high marshes of the southwestern Atlantic coast. Four questions were explored. Is there a relationship between the spatial distribution of C. granulate and the spatial distribution of rooted macrophytes or distance from the marsh edge? How important is plant cover for the establishment and survival of crabs in the high marsh'? Does plant cover affect critical physical variables for crab establishment? How important are environmental conditions for the survival of crabs in the high marsh? Surveys of the marsh surface showed that: (1) there was a strong relationship between the presence of plant cover and the spatial distribution of Chasmagnathus granulata in the high marsh, and (2) both mean crab size and burrow density decreased from the marsh edge to high-marsh levels. By shading the substrate, live plants and experimental plant mimics were found to be equally efficient at buffering high temperature, dehydration, and soil hardness in the high marsh. Experimental amelioration of these harsh physical conditions led to higher crab densities. Crab burrows also buffered harsh environmental conditions, diminishing surface air temperature from similar to46degreesC to 23degreesC. Finally, tethering experiments showed that stressful heating in the high marsh is lethal for crabs, and that plant cover is crucial for the establishment and long-term success of crabs in the high marsh. No predation was observed in tethering experiments. Our results suggest that plant cover is largely responsible for determining the spatial distribution of this dominant crab in the high marsh through facilitation. Thus, our work shows that plant-animal facilitations as well as plant-plant facilitations are important structuring forces in salt marsh communities.","Univ Mar del Plata, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Biol, RA-7600 Mar Del Plata, Argentina","Bortolus, A (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Box G-W 101,80 Waterman St, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",bortolus@brown.edu,,"Schwindt, Evangelina/0000-0001-6693-9828; Bortolus, Alejandro/0000-0003-3035-315X",,,,49,66,73,2,31,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAR,2002,83,3,,,,,733,742,,10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[0733:PPAIIT]2.0.CO;2,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,523QY,WOS:000173967500014,,,,,2021-09-27,

Among the natural enemies that regulate their populations, aphid parasitoids are commonly used in biological control programs in greenhouses and field situations. They belong to the Hymenoptera (Braconidae and Aphelinidae), and a few species are Diptera (Cecidomyiidae). Aphid parasitoids are themselves exposed to a variety of natural enemies including predators, fungi and hyperparasitoids. The most important impediment to the use of aphid parasitoids as biological control agents remains the production cost to mass-rear parasitoids. Rearing either aphids or directly aphid parasitoids in artificial media could be a solution to produce large quantities of aphid parasitoids at low cost, but such an approach still faces numerous challenges related to the nutritional and physiological requirements of developing aphid parasitoids.","[Boivin, Guy] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Hort Res & Dev Ctr, St Jean, PQ J3B 3E6, Canada; [Boivin, Guy] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci Entomol, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Hance, Thierry] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Ctr Rech Biodivers, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Brodeur, Jacques] Univ Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada","Boivin, G (corresponding author), Agr & Agri Food Canada, Hort Res & Dev Ctr, 430 Blvd Gouin, St Jean, PQ J3B 3E6, Canada.",guy.boivin@agr.gc.ca,,,,,,122,77,79,3,97,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4220,1918-1833,,CAN J PLANT SCI,Can.

Theoretically, giants emerge when a strong recruiting cohort imposes competition induced mortality on stunted adults, but also provides a profitable resource for a few adults that accelerate in growth and reach giant sizes. Here the effects of a recruitment pulse on the individual and population level in an allopatric Arctic char population have been studied over a 5-year period and these results were contrasted with theoretical model predictions for the conditions necessary for the emergence of cannibalistic giants. The recruitment pulse had negative effects on invertebrate resource abundance, and the decrease in body condition and increase in mortality of adult char suggested that strong intercohort competition took place. The frequency of cannibalism increased and a few char accelerated in growth and reached 'giant' sizes. The main discrepancy between model predictions and field data was the apparently small effect the recruited cohort had on resources and adult char performance during their first summer. Instead, the effects became pronounced when the cohort was 1 year old. This mismatch between model predictions and field observations was suggested to be due to the low per capita fecundity in char and the restricted nearshore habitat use in young-of-the-year (YOY) char. This study provides empirical evidence that the emergence of giants is associated with the breakthrough of a strong recruiting cohort and also suggests that the claimed stable char populations with large cannibals may instead be populations with dynamic size structure that results in intermittent breakthroughs of recruitment pulses, providing the conditions necessary for char to enter the cannibalistic niche. The data suggest that increased recruit survival through restricted habitat use may destabilize dynamics and cause the emergence of giants. However, they also suggest that this does not necessarily develop into populations with bi-modal size structure in populations with low per capita fecundity and size- and density-dependent habitat use of recruiting cohorts.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Agr, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Bystrom, P (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Agr, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",par.bystrom@emg.umu.se,,,,,,29,29,32,0,15,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

In the biodiversity hotspot of the Western Ghats in India, we find that wind farms reduce the abundance and activity of predatory birds (for example, Buteo, Butastur and Elanus species), which consequently increases the density of lizards, Sarada superba. The cascading effects of wind turbines on lizards include changes in behaviour, physiology and morphology that reflect a combination of predator release and density-dependent competition. By adding an effective trophic level to the top of food webs, we find that wind farms have emerging impacts that are greatly underestimated. There is thus a strong need for an ecosystem-wide view when aligning green-energy goals with environment protection.","[Thaker, Maria; Zambre, Amod; Bhosale, Harshal] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bengaluru, India; [Zambre, Amod] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behavior, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Thaker, M (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bengaluru, India.",mthaker@iisc.ac.in,,"Thaker, Maria/0000-0001-6019-2639; Zambre, Amod/0000-0002-0054-5532","Environmental Science Department of Fergusson College, Pune; DST-FISTDepartment of Science & Technology (India); DBT-IISc partnership programmeNewton-Al-Farabi Partnership Programme; MOEF-CC","We thank the Maharashtra Forest Department for permits and Suzlon for allowing us to work on their property.

It is therefore essential to design restoration experiments that both further our basic knowledge of tropical ecology and inform management strategies to facilitate recovery of these ecosystems. Here we synthesize the results of research on tropical montane forest recovery in abandoned pasture in Costa Rica to address the following questions: (1) What factors limit tropical forest recovery in abandoned pasture? and (2) How can we use this information to design strategies to facilitate ecosystem recovery? Our results indicate that a number of factors impede tropical forest recovery in abandoned pasture land. The most important barriers are lack of dispersal of forest seeds and seedling competition with pasture grasses. High seed predation, low seed germination, lack of nutrients, high light intensity, and rabbit herbivory also affect recovery. Successful strategies to facilitate recovery in abandoned pastures must simultaneously overcome numerous obstacles. Our research shows that establishment of woody species, either native tree seedlings or early-successional shrubs, can be successful in facilitating recovery, by enhancing seed dispersal and shading out pasture grasses. On the contrary, bird perching structures alone are not an effective strategy, because they only serve to enhance seed dispersal but do not reduce grass cover. Remnant pasture trees can serve as foci of natural recovery and may enhance growth of planted seedlings. Our results highlight the importance of: (1) understanding the basic biology of an ecosystem to design effective restoration strategies; (2) comparing results across a range of sites to determine which restoration strategies are most generally useful; and (3) considering where best to allocate efforts in large-scale restoration projects.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Holl, KD (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",kholl@cats.ucsc.edu,"Holl, Karen/D-8033-2014","Holl, Karen/0000-0003-2893-6161",,,,73,365,399,5,151,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,1526-100X,,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

Amphibians play a critical role both as consumers and prey in aquatic communities and yet there is still little information on the trophic status of most amphibians. More importantly, little is known about the extent to which they can alter their trophic ecology in response to changing conditions. We experimentally investigated the effects of increased amphibian density, presence of intraguild competitors, and presence of native and invasive predators (either free or caged) on the trophic status of a Mediterranean amphibian guild, using stable isotopes. We observed variations in delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic values among amphibian species and treatments and differences in their food sources. Macrophytes were the most important food resource for spadefoot toad tadpoles (Pelobates cultripes) and relatively important for all anurans within the guild. High density and presence of P. cultripes tadpoles markedly reduced macrophyte biomass, forcing tadpoles to increase their feeding on detritus, algae and zooplankton, resulting in lower delta C-13 values. Native dytiscid predators only changed the isotopic signature of newts whereas invasive red swamp crayfish had an enormous impact on environmental conditions and greatly affected the isotopic values of amphibians. Crayfish forced tadpoles to increase detritus ingestion or other resources depleted in delta C-13. We found that the opportunistic amphibian feeding was greatly conditioned by intra-and interspecific competition whereas non-consumptive predator effects were negligible. Determining the trophic plasticity of amphibians can help us understand natural and anthropogenic changes in aquatic ecosystems and assess amphibians' ability to adjust to different environmental conditions.","[Arribas, Rosa; Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan] CSIC, Donana Biol Stn, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, E-41080 Seville, Spain; [Caut, Stephane] CSIC, Dept Ethol & Conservat Biodivers, Donana Biol Stn, E-41080 Seville, Spain","Gomez-Mestre, I (corresponding author), CSIC, Donana Biol Stn, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, E-41080 Seville, Spain.",igmestre@ebd.csic.es,"Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/L-8931-2014; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan/F-8226-2014","Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/0000-0002-6717-0173; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan/0000-0003-0094-8195","Plan Nacional I+D from Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [CGL2009-11123, CGL2012-4044]; Spanish Severo Ochoa Program [SEV-2012-0262]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity [BES2010-042243]","Funding for this study was provided by grants CGL2009-11123 and CGL2012-4044 from Plan Nacional I+D from Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, from the Spanish Severo Ochoa Program (SEV-2012-0262), and dissertation grant BES2010-042243 awarded to RA by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity.",,61,26,26,1,47,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUN 19,2015,10,6,,,,,,,e0130897,10.1371/journal.pone.0130897,,,19,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CL3FE,WOS:000356835000157,26091281,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-27,

Parasites are also important in shaping the ecology of free-living species; however, their effects are often overlooked because parasites can be difficult to detect. Parasites can be particularly challenging to observe in zooplankton hosts because of their small size and ephemeral infection periods. To overcome these challenges, we used a quarantine approach combined with high-magnification microscopy to increase detection of parasites of the tropical Cladoceran, Ceriodaphnia cornuta, in Lake Gatun, Panama. Using this approach, we were able to demonstrate that competing morphs of Ceriodaphnia experience differential rates of infection, where the subordinate competitor suffered higher parasite prevalence than did the dominant morph. Predation by fishes on the dominant morph is considered the principal mechanism for their coexistence, but we hypothesize that parasites may also play a role in maintaining morphotype diversity of Ceriodaphnia.","[Stewart, T.

Given that populations suffering severe declines are of conservation concern, we examined the foraging ecology of southern sea lions (SSL) (Otaria flavescens)-one of the least studied otariids (fur seal and sea lions)-which have declined by over 90 % at the Falkland Islands since the 1930s. Using a combination of biologging devices and stable isotope analysis of vibrissae, we redress major gaps in the knowledge of SSL ecology and quantify patterns of individual specialization. Specifically, we revealed two discrete foraging strategies, these being inshore (coastal) and offshore (outer Patagonian Shelf). The majority of adult female SSL (72 % or n = 21 of 29 SSL) foraged offshore. Adult female SSL that foraged offshore travelled further (92 +/- A 20 vs. 10 +/- A 4 km) and dived deeper (75 +/- A 23 vs. 21 +/- A 8 m) when compared to those that foraged inshore. Stable isotope analysis revealed long-term fidelity (years) to these discrete foraging habitats. In addition, we found further specialization within the offshore group, with adult female SSL separated into two clusters on the basis of benthic or mixed (benthic and pelagic) dive behavior (benthic dive proportion was 76 +/- A 9 vs. 51 +/- A 8 %, respectively). We suggest that foraging specialization in depleted populations such as SSL breeding at the Falkland Islands, are influenced by foraging site fidelity, and could be independent of intraspecific competition. Finally, the behavioral differences we describe are crucial to understanding population-level dynamics, impediments to population recovery, and threats to population persistence.","[Baylis, A. M.

Each 2-ha plot was divided into two equal parts by a fence with gates allowing easy passage of the gerbils. We varied the number of gerbils in the enclosure and the number of owl flights on each side of the dividing fence. Gerbil foraging activity responded within two hours to the difference in number of owl flights over the subplots. The greater the difference, the more the gerbils shifted their foraging to the subplot with fewer flights. Gerbils did not reduce their total foraging effort but redistributed it between subplots. In the absence of owl flights, gerbils divided their foraging effort equally between the matched subplots. Thus, they appear to seek an ideal free distribution in the two halves of each plot. Therefore, based on the gerbils' distribution of activity in the presence of different numbers of owl flights over the two subplots we estimated the shapes and slopes of the gerbil victim isoclines in the middle and right hand side of the 'gerbil-activity vs number of owl flights' state space. The isoclines were parallel straight lines with slope equal to -0.57. We believe this to be the first estimate of a victim isocline for a population of vertebrates in the field. Using the isodar method of Morris, we also determined that the fitness cost of each additional gerbil, i.e., per capita intraspecific competition among the G. allenbyi, is constant. It does not depend on either owl flight frequencies or G. allenbyi densities. The isodar also shows that the fitness cost of added owl flights does not vary with G. allenbyi population densities.","UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA","Abramsky, Z (corresponding author), BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV, DEPT LIFE SCI, IL-84105 BEER SHEVA, ISRAEL.",,"ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012",,,,,58,44,45,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,1997,78,1,,,,,81,90,,10.2307/3545803,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WJ109,WOS:A1997WJ10900010,,,,,2021-09-27,

Here, we analyze the relative impact of the non-native wild boar and native rodents on seed survival and seedling establishment of the mast conifer Araucaria araucana. Predation, seed survival and seedling establishment were measured at different microsites and distances from 11 isolated trees in Lanin National Park (Argentina) over a period of marked fluctuation in seed production. Wild boar consumed between 10 and 30% of available seeds on a 13-day period, threefold less than rodents. Wild boar predation was mainly affected by forest canopy composition, while microsite conditions influenced both kind of predators, with high chronic rodent predation underneath dense vegetation and moderate (but interannually variable) wild boar predation at poorly vegetated microsites. Predation by rodents was spatially clustered at the microsite scale, particularly during non-mast years; while predation by wild boar was spatially structured at a coarser scale and less modified by masting. The exclusion of wild boar increased significantly the amount of surviving seeds, resulting in higher seedling establishment in intermediate production years, but not affecting it during the mast year. At tree level, seedling establishment was negatively correlated with predation; while at stand level, cone production accounted for most of the seedling establishment variability. The current wild boar population may not be affecting the seedling establishment at population scale, probably due to minimization of its impact by the Araucaria masting strategy. However, if wild boar population numbers continue to increase, their impact may shift from individual tree scale to stand scale, threatening Araucaria forest regeneration.","[Kitzberger, Thomas] Univ Nacl Comahue, CRUB, CONICET, INIBIOMA, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Kitzberger, Thomas] Univ Nacl Comahue, CRUB, Lab Ecotono, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Sanguinetti, Javier] Adm Parques Nacl, Parque Nacl Lanin, RA-8371 San Martin De Los, Argentina","Kitzberger, T (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, CRUB, CONICET, INIBIOMA, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",kitzberger@gmail.com,"Kitzberger, Thomas/H-9209-2015","Kitzberger, Thomas/0000-0002-9754-4121",German Government; International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI); Russell Train Scholarship; Agencia Espanola de Coop.

However, it remains unclear whether classic animal-habitat associations that influence the spatial distribution of plant-animal interactions, such as small mammal use of downed woody debris, persist in invaded habitats. We removed an invasive exotic shrub (buckthorn, Rhamnus cathartica) from 7 of 15 plots in Wisconsin. In each plot, we deployed 200 tagged Quercus rubra seeds in November 2014. After five months, tags were recovered to track spatial patterns of small mammal seed predation. Most recovered tags were associated with consumed seeds (95%); live-trapping, ancillary camera-trapping, and previous behavioral studies suggest that white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) were responsible for most seed predation. In habitats without R. cathartica, most seed predation occurred near woody debris. In habitats with R. cathartica, small mammals rarely consumed seeds near woody debris, and seed predation occurred farther from the plot center and was less spatially clustered. Our results illustrate that invasive exotic shrubs can disrupt an otherwise common animal-habitat relationship. Failing to account for changes in habitat use may diminish our ability to predict animal distributions and outcomes of species interactions in novel habitats created by invasive exotic plants.","[Guiden, Peter W.; Orrock, John L.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Guiden, PW (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",guiden@wisc.edu,,,UW Vilas Associates Fellowship,"We thank K.

In response to herbivory, plants emit a blend that may be quantitatively and qualitatively different from the blend emitted when intact. This induced volatile blend alters the interactions of the plant with its environment. We review recent developments regarding the induction mechanism as well as the ecological consequences in a multitrophic and evolutionary context. It has been well established that carnivores (predators and parasitoids) are attracted by the volatiles induced by their herbivorous victims. This concerns an active plant response. In the case of attraction of predators, this is likely to result in a fitness benefit to the plant, because through consumption a predator removes the herbivores from the plant. However, the benefit to the plant is less clear when parasitoids are attracted, because parasitisation does usually not result in an instantaneous or in a complete termination of consumption by the herbivore. Recently, empirical evidence has been obtained that shows that the plant's response can increase plant fitness, in terms of seed production, due to a reduced consumption rate of parasitized herbivores. However, apart from a benefit from attracting carnivores, the induced volatiles can have a serious cost because there is an increasing number of studies that show that herbivores can be attracted. However, this does not necessarily result in settlement of the herbivores on the emitting plant. The presence of cues from herbivores and/or carnivores that indicate that the plant is a competitor- and/or enemy-dense space, may lead to an avoidance response. Thus, the benefit of emission of induced volatiles is likely to depend on the prevailing faunal composition. Whether plants can adjust their response and influence the emission of the induced volatiles, taking the prevalent environmental conditions into account, is an interesting question that needs to be addressed. The induced volatiles may also affect interactions of the emitting plant with its neighbours, e.g., through altered competitive ability or by the neighbour exploiting the emitted information. Major questions to be addressed in this research field comprise mechanistic aspects, such as the identification of the minimally effective blend of volatiles that explains the attraction of carnivores to herbivore-infested plants, and evolutionary aspects such as the fitness consequences of induced volatiles. The elucidation of mechanistic aspects is important for addressing ecological and evolutionary questions. For instance, an important tool to address ecological and evolutionary aspects would be to have plant pairs that differ in only a single trait. Such plants are likely to become available in the near future as a result of mechanistic studies on signal-transduction pathways and an increased interest in molecular genetics.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Entomol Lab, NL-6700 EH Wageningen, Netherlands","Dicke, M (corresponding author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Entomol Lab, POB 8031, NL-6700 EH Wageningen, Netherlands.",,"thorhallsdottir, anna gudrun/B-6037-2011; van Loon, Joop J.A./B-3744-2009; Dicke, Marcel/B-2300-2010","thorhallsdottir, anna gudrun/0000-0001-7201-6931; van Loon, Joop J.A./0000-0002-4260-0501; Dicke, Marcel/0000-0001-8565-8896",,,,119,386,432,3,177,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-8703,1570-7458,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

However, there is a possibility that native species that occupy the same habitats may influence the population performance of Ae. albopictus, potentially affecting the establishment of this species in Australia. Cohabitation experiments were performed with the endemic Aedes notoscriptus (Skuse), which has been found occupying the same larval habitats as Ae. albopictus in the Torres Strait and is the most widespread container-inhabiting Aedes species in Australia. The influence of environmental factors and cohabitation between the two species was examined using different climates, food resource levels, food resource types, and species densities. Survivorship proportions and a population performance index (lambda') were calculated and compared. The consequences of increased Ae. notoscriptus densities were reduced survivorship and lambda' for Ae. albopictus. Despite this, the mean lambda' of Ae. albopictus and Ae. notoscriptus was consistently >= 1.06, indicating both species could increase under all conditions, potentially due to increasing conspecific densities negatively affecting Ae. notoscriptus. The outcomes from this study suggest that the preexisting presence of Ae. notoscriptus may not prevent the establishment of Ae. albopictus in Australia.","[Nicholson, J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Pathol & Lab Med, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Nicholson, J.; Van den Hurk, A.

Here we show that a dominant, relatively naive, high-elevation species, whitebark pine, has inferior defenses against mountain pine beetle compared with its historical lower-elevation host, lodgepole pine. Lodgepole pines respond by exuding more resin and accumulating higher concentrations of toxic monoterpenes than whitebark pine, where they co-occur. Furthermore, the chemical composition of whitebark pine appears less able to inhibit the pheromonal communication beetles use to jointly overcome tree defenses. Despite whitebark pine's inferior defenses, beetles were more likely to attack their historical host in mixed stands. This finding suggests there has been insufficient sustained contact for beetles to alter their complex behavioral mechanisms driving host preference. In no-choice assays, however, beetles readily entered and tunneled in both hosts equally, and in stands containing less lodgepole pine, attacks on whitebark pines increased. High-elevation trees in pure stands may thus be particularly vulnerable to temperature-driven range expansions. Predators and competitors were more attracted to volatiles from herbivores attacking their historical host, further increasing risk in less coevolved systems. Our results suggest cold temperatures provided a sufficient barrier against herbivores for high-elevation trees to allocate resources to other physiological processes besides defense. Changing climate may reduce the viability of that evolutionary strategy, and the life histories of high-elevation trees seem unlikely to foster rapid counter adaptation. Consequences extend from reduced food supplies for endangered grizzly bears to altered landscape and hydrological processes.","[Raffa, Kenneth F.; Powell, Erinn N.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Townsend, Philip A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Raffa, KF (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",kfraffa@wisc.edu,"Townsend, Philip A/B-5741-2008","Townsend, Philip A/0000-0001-7003-8774",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0816541]; University of Wisconsin College of Agricultural and Life Sciences,"We thank the National Park Service and University of Wyoming-National Park Service Research Center for site access and lodging; Megan Fork, Katherine Molter, Christopher Foelker, Melissa Greulich, Andrew Long, John Muller, Christopher Pennings, Hannah Manninen, Hannah Hubanks, Ryan Sword, and Austin Pethan for field assistance; and Claudio Gratton and three anonymous reviewers for critical review.

We first addressed: (i) the regulation of arthropod communities by weed diversity at genetic, species and habitat levels, (ii) the regulation of weed communities by arthropods through seed predation and dispersal and (iii) below-ground weed-insect interactions. We then focussed on methodologies to study weed-arthropod interactions in agricultural landscapes and discuss techniques potentially available for data analysis and the importance of joint weed-arthropod trend detection. Lastly, we discuss the implications of research findings for biodiversity conservation policies (agri-environmental schemes) and suggest some priorities for future work. Results showed that to date research has largely ignored weed-arthropod interactions in agricultural landscapes. No information is available on the role of weed genetic diversity as driver of weed-arthropod interactions, whereas studies on effects of species and habitat diversity often lack a functional perspective and/or a spatial component. Also, information on how management of the wider agricultural biotope might express positive weed-arthropod functional interactions is scarce. Another area worth being explored is the relationship between weed-leaf/root herbivores and beneficial arthropods. Tools for spatial data analysis might be useful for elucidating weed-arthropod interactions in agricultural landscapes, but some methodological aspects, e.g. the definition of the most appropriate experimental design and sampling scale/frequency, must be refined. New studies on weed-arthropod interactions should encompass an explicit spatial component; this knowledge is particularly important for improving IPM/IWM systems and designing more targeted agri-environmental schemes.","[Barberi, P.; Moonen, A.

It has been shown that the reproductive success of birds of prey is closely related to food availability. However, relatively little is known about intraspecific differences in reproductive success of birds in relation to varying ecological conditions across environmental gradients. We investigated the reproductive performance of Tengmalm's Owls Aegolius funereus in a temperate (Czech Republic, 50 degrees N) and a boreal (Finland, 63 degrees N) population in relation to long-term variations in the abundance of their main prey (small rodents). Prey densities at the northern site were much higher, but there were also large inter-annual fluctuations and years with steep summer declines of vole densities. Northern owls laid larger clutches but offspring production per nest was similar at both study sites. This resulted from higher nestling mortality in the northern population, especially in nests established later in the season. Despite much greater nesting losses due to predation by Pine Martens Martes martes, productivity at the population level was about four times greater at the temperate site, mainly due to the much higher breeding densities compared with Finland. Tengmalm's Owls at the temperate study site may benefit from relatively stable prey abundance, a more diverse prey community that offers alternative prey during vole scarcity, longer nights in summer that allow more time for foraging, and a lower level of interspecific competition with other vole-specialized predators.","[Zarybnicka, Marketa; Stastny, Karel] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, CZ-16521 Prague, Czech Republic; [Sedlacek, Ondrej] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, CZ-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic; [Salo, Palvi; Korpimaki, Erkki] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland","Sedlacek, O (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, Vinicna 7, CZ-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic.",zbrd@email.cz,"ZArybnickA, MarkA©ta/AAM-3181-2020; Sedlacek, Ondrej/A-1667-2009","Zarybnicka, Marketa/0000-0001-5883-0988","Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [CIGA 20144203]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [FRVS 41110-1161-1625]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [138638, 123379, 136717, 250709]","We are grateful to V.

Negative effects have been found in avian populations and these have been mainly attributed to food limitations. In this study, we investigated whether density-dependent effects could result from either heterogeneity in habitat suitability, interference among neighbours, or predation. To test these hypotheses, we collected data over eight years in a growing population of temperate-nesting Canada geese Branta canadensis maxima. We compared different parameters of nesting success of geese between two sites characterized by different nest densities and looked at the effects of nest proximity on these parameters within each site. At the landscape level, we found density-dependent effects due to variation in habitat quality associated with predation probabilities and flooding events. At a finer scale, nesting success declined with proximity to neighbours, probably due to increased aggressive interactions among pairs. However, complete clutch predation showed both positive and negative density-dependence, due to differences in predator community at each site. We concluded that density-dependent effects reduced nesting success of Canada geese through both heterogeneity in habitat safety and agonistic interference between neighbours but that density-dependent effects could also be positive in some instances.","[Lebeuf, Anik Pannetier; Giroux, Jean-Francois] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, Grp Rech Ecol Comportementale & Anim, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Lebeuf, AP (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Biol, Grp Rech Ecol Comportementale & Anim, POB 8888,Stn Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",giroux.jean-francois@uqam.ca,"Giroux, Jean-Francois/L-7945-2019","Giroux, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-6732-489X",Environment CanadaCGIAR; Fonds de recherche du Quebec Nature et technologies,"This study was financially supported by Environment Canada and by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada through a scholarship to APL and a research grant to J-FG.

The archetype of these models is the ideal free distribution, characterized by an evolutionary stable state where more competitors aggregate in better habitats, so that the fitness benefit of resource abundance is equally offset by the cost of competition in all habitats. In this study, we used parentage analysis on microsatellite genotypes to test the ideal free distribution in a natural population of aphid parasitoids. Parentage analysis was conducted on parasitoids emerging from aphid colonies. We inferred the number of foundress females which had reproduced in each colony, as well as the number of offspring for each foundress. As predicted by the ideal free distribution, the number of offspring per foundress per colony did not depend on the number of hosts per colony. However, contrary to ideal free distribution predictions, it was affected by the number of foundresses per colony. In surprising contrast with the basic assumption of negative density dependence, individual fitness increased with the number of foundresses. Moreover, parentage analysis revealed a very low number of offspring per foundress per colony (mean = 1.8). This observed distribution questions the validity of classical models of habitat choice based on competition. Indeed, our results provide a new illustration reinforcing a growing body of theory and data on positive density dependence. Our results also suggest that the avoidance of hyperparasitism and predation, although generally neglected, may shape the distribution of parasitoids in the field.","[Tentelier, Cedric; Guillemaud, Thomas; Ferry, Sarah; Fauvergue, Xavier] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, UMR INRA, Interact Biot Sante Vegetale, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France","Tentelier, C (corresponding author), Univ Pau & Pays Adour, UMR INRA ECOBIOP, Allee Parc Montaury, F-64600 Anglet, France.",cedric.tentelier@univ-pau.fr,"Tentelier, Cedric/AAH-6038-2019; guillemaud, thomas/B-4899-2012; Tentelier, Cedric/L-7195-2017; fauvergue, xavier/B-9108-2012","guillemaud, thomas/0000-0003-0451-1644; Tentelier, Cedric/0000-0003-2178-4900; fauvergue, xavier/0000-0002-3579-7721",,,,48,12,12,0,61,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

Here, we present a theoretical framework to describe the competition-defense tradeoff and apply it to a size-based model of a unicellular plankton community. Specifically, we investigate how the emergent community structure depends on the shape of the tradeoff, and on whether the cost of defense is paid for by a lowered resource affinity or by an elevated metabolic rate. The inclusion of defense affects the size distribution and trophic strategies of the emerging community dependent on environmental conditions (eutrophic versus oligotrophic) and leads to increased diversity in size and trophic strategy under eutrophic conditions. Eutrophic conditions allow for better-defended organisms than oligotrophic conditions. In most scenarios, competition-defense tradeoffs dampen trophic cascades in the seasonal cycle simulations, and increase the abundance of mixotrophs. We further demonstrate that it matters how the cost of defense is manifest (decreased affinity versus increased metabolic rate), and that it has a significant effect on the resulting plankton community (overall biomass, size and feeding strategy diversity), particularly when the efficiency of the defense increases in direct proportion to the investment. Our results demonstrate that the structure of the ecosystem crucially depends on details of the defense tradeoff. This finding highlights the importance of a mechanistic understanding of defense tradeoffs, e.g. obtained through experimental measurements of specific defense mechanisms.","[Cadier, Mathilde; Andersen, Ken H.; Visser, Andre W.; Kiorboe, Thomas] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Aqua, Ctr Ocean Life, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark","Cadier, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Aqua, Ctr Ocean Life, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",mcad@aqua.dtu.dk,"Kiorboe, Thomas/ABI-4733-2020; Kiorboe, Thomas/G-3190-2011; Visser, Andre/G-6317-2015","Kiorboe, Thomas/0000-0002-3265-336X; Visser, Andre/0000-0002-1604-7263; Andersen, Ken Haste/0000-0002-8478-3430",Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation [5479]; Villum Foundation,We acknowledge support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation through award #5479.

The extent to which combinations of these stressors affect aquatic populations and the role of nutrients availability in modulating these responses requires further understanding. In this study, we assessed how pesticides affecting different taxonomic groups and predation influence the response of Daphnia pulex populations under different trophic conditions. An outdoor experiment was designed following a factorial design, with the insecticide chlorpyrifos, the herbicide diuron, and the predation by Notonecta sp. individuals as key stressors. The single impact of each of these stressors, and their binary and tertiary combinations, was evaluated on D. pulex abundance and population structure under mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions for 21 days. Data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models estimated by means of a novel Bayesian shrinkage technique. Our study shows a significant influence of each of the evaluated stressors on D. pulex abundance; however, the impacts of the herbicide and predation were lower under eutrophic conditions as compared to the mesotrophic ones. We found that binary stressor interactions were generally additive in the mesotrophic scenario, except for the herbicide-predation combination, which resulted in synergistic effects. The impacts of the binary stressor combinations in the eutrophic scenario were classified as antagonistic, except for the insecticide-herbicide combination, which was additive. The tertiary interaction resulted in significant effects on some sampling dates; however, these were rather antagonistic and resembled the most important binary stressor combination in each trophic scenario. Our study shows that the impact of pesticides on freshwater populations depends on the predation pressure, and demonstrates that the combined effect of pesticides and ecological stressors is influenced by the food availability and organism fitness related to the trophic status of freshwater ecosystems.","[Oliveira dos Anjos, Talles Bruno; Polazzo, Francesco; Arenas-Sanchez, Alba; Cherta, Laura; Vighi, Marco; Rico, Andreu] Univ Alcala De Henares, IMDEA Water Inst, Sci & Technol Campus,Ave Punto Com 2, Alcala De Henares 28805, Spain; [Oliveira dos Anjos, Talles Bruno] Univ Koblenz Landau, Landau In Der Pfalz, Germany; [Ascari, Roberto; Migliorati, Sonia] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, Milan, Italy; [Rico, Andreu] Univ Valencia, Cavanilles Inst Biodivers & Evolutionary Biol, Paterna, Spain","Rico, A (corresponding author), Univ Alcala De Henares, IMDEA Water Inst, Sci & Technol Campus,Ave Punto Com 2, Alcala De Henares 28805, Spain.",andreu.rico@imdea.org,"Migliorati, Sonia/AAS-9064-2021; Rico, Andreu/G-1102-2016","Rico, Andreu/0000-0002-1820-4218; ASCARI, ROBERTO/0000-0003-0146-976X",H2020-MSCA-ITN ECORISK2050 project [813124]; CICLIC-ECOREST project [RTI2018-097158-A-C32]; Ramon y Cajal grant provided by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [RYC2019-028132-I]; scholarship Erasmus-PROMOS; STIBET by Deutschen Akademischen Austauschdienst (DAAD); international office of the University Koblenz-Landau,This study has been funded by the H2020-MSCA-ITN ECORISK2050 project (nr. 813124) and the CICLIC-ECOREST project (RTI2018-097158-A-C32).

Two samples representative of each depth were collected and stored in opaque bottles after two periods of 7 h. We took advantage of the bottle effect to investigate changes in the natural microbial communities (abundant and rare). We recovered 94 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and 1089 metagenomic viral contigs and examined their abundance using metagenomic recruitment. We detected a significant fast growth of copiotrophic bacteria such as Alteromonas or Erythrobacter throughout the entire water column with different dynamics that we assign to clonal, polyclonal, or multispecies depending on the recruitment pattern. Results also showed a marked ecotype succession in the phototropic picocyanobacteria that were able to grow at all the depths in the absence of light, highlighting the importance of their mixotrophic potential. In addition, wall-chain-reaction hypothesis based on the study of phage-host dynamics showed the higher impact of viral predation on archaea in deeper waters, evidencing their prominent role during incubations.

These competitive asymmetries can drive variation in demographic rates, influencing the ecology and evolution of life histories. The magnitude and direction of such asymmetries differ among taxa, yet little is known empirically about how adaptation to resource limitation alters competitive asymmetries. Here, we investigate the relationship between size-dependent competitive ability and adaptation to resource limitation. We examined size-dependent competition in two ecotypes of Trinidadian guppy, adapted to high or low levels of resource competition. Using aquaria-based competition experiments, we describe how the size and ecotype of competitors influence somatic growth rate, whilst controlling for the confounding effect of niche differentiation. We replicated our study across two independent evolutionary origins of the competitive ecotype. The two competitive ecotypes differed markedly in size-dependent asymmetry, indicating that adaptation to resource limitation alone is insufficient to explain changes in size-dependent competitive asymmetry. For one origin, the ecotype adapted to resource limitation was a superior competitor over a wide range of size pairings. The equivalence of competitors varied over fivefold, dependent on size and ecotype; in three of four populations, larger individuals had a competitive advantage. Our results demonstrate that competitive asymmetry has strong effects on somatic growth. Because somatic growth contributes to demographic parameters, intraspecific trait variation is likely to play a key role in regulating demographic rates. Our findings imply that the evolution of size-dependent asymmetries under conditions of intense competition is likely to be constrained by niche availability, although further research is needed to verify this.","[Potter, Tomos; King, Leighton; Bassar, Ronald D.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Travis, Joseph] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Bassar, Ronald D.] Williams Coll, Dept Biol, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA","Potter, T (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England.",tomos.potter@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Potter, Tomos/AAF-8255-2020","Potter, Tomos/0000-0003-3201-6130",Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1556884],"Division of Environmental Biology, Grant/Award Number: 1556884",,51,8,8,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We examined the role of the presence of conspecific females in informing adaptive cannibalism decisions. Females of the hemipteran bug Geocoris pallens express low egg cannibalism when alone but become much more cannibalistic in the presence of conspecific females and do not discriminate between their own eggs and those of other females. Experimentation showed that females that could not commit filial cannibalism exhibited strong egg cannibalism that was not reduced by the presence of conspecific females, whereas females that could commit filial cannibalism were very cannibalistic only in the presence of conspecifics. An experiment also showed that the presence of conspecific females triggered a stronger egg cannibalism response in G. pallens than did a heterospecific egg predator. These results suggest that G. pallens females become cannibalistic in the presence of conspecifics because they interpret conspecific presence primarily as an indication of decreased likelihood of committing filial cannibalism, and less so as an indication of lower expected survival of eggs or future resource competition. Our study highlights the importance of informational cues, in this case the presence of conspecifics, in modulating the expression of cannibalism.

The reverse is also appreciated: adaptation impacts population density. Yet, empirically demonstrating a direct connection between population density and adaptation is challenging. Here, we address both evolution and ecology of population density in models of viral (bacteriophage) chemostats. Chemostats supply nutrients for host cell growth, and the hosts are prey for viral reproduction. Two different chemostat designs have profoundly different consequences for viral evolution. If host and virus are confined to the same chamber, as in a predator-prey system, viral regulation of hosts feeds back to maintain low viral density (measured as infections per cell). Viral adaptation impacts host density but has a small effect on equilibrium viral density. More interesting are chemostats that supply the viral population with hosts from a virus-free refuge. Here, a type of evolutionary succession operates: adaptation at low viral density leads to higher density, but high density then favors competitive ability. Experiments support these models with both phenotypic and molecular data. Parallels to these designs exist in many natural systems, so these experimental systems may yield insights to the evolution and regulation of natural populations.","Univ Texas, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Idaho, Dept Biol Sci, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; Univ Idaho, Program Bioinformat & Computat Biol, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Bull, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Inst Mol & Cellular Biol, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",bull@bull.biosci.utexas.edu; hwichman@uidaho.edu,,,NIGMS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [GM-57756] Funding Source: Medline; PHS HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Public Health Service [RRO16448] Funding Source: Medline,,,59,61,62,0,18,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Usually an inverse correlation between scan rate and flock size exists. The 'many-eyes' hypothesis suggests that more eyes are able to detect a predator earlier. Due to the 'dilution-effect' animals in larger groups experience 'safety in numbers', while the 'scramble competition' hypothesis suggests that individuals reduce their vigilance in larger groups since they compete for a limited amount of scarce resources. Here, I induced competition in natural coot populations. Coots preferred feeding on grass and were occasionally fed by passers-by at the study sites. However, this resource was scarce and coots experienced additional food as a very limited resource. I sampled coots prior and after an experimental treatment with an additional food supply. Correlations between vigilance rate (number of scans during 1 min of foraging), nearest neighbor distance and flock size existed before the experimental treatment but afterwards the correlation between vigilance and nearest neighbor distance faded. I found a significantly lower vigilance rate and nearest neighbor distance after inducing competition. This study provided experimental evidence for the 'scramble competition' hypothesis namely that individuals in groups lowered their vigilance when faced with competition for a limited amount of food resources given similar flock sizes.

However, large Daphnia commonly exhibit midsummer extinctions in ponds lacking planktivorous fish. A number of empirical and theoretical studies suggest that resource competition and its interaction with nutrient enrichment may determine variable dominance by large Daphnia. Low resource levels may favor competitive dominance by small-bodied taxa while large Daphnia may be favored under high resource conditions or following a nutrient/productivity pulse. Nutrient enrichment may also influence the strength of invertebrate predation on Daphnia by affecting how long vulnerable juveniles are exposed to predation. We investigated these hypotheses using an in situ mesocosm experiment in a permanent fishless pond that exhibited seasonal losses of Daphnia pulex. To explore the effects of nutrient enrichment, Daphnia plus a diverse assemblage of small-bodied zooplankton were exposed to three levels of enrichment (low, medium, and high). To explore the interaction between nutrient enrichment and invertebrate predation, we crossed the presence/absence of Notonecta undulata with low and high nutrient manipulations. We found no evidence of competitive reversals or shifts in dominance among nutrient levels, Daphnia performed poorly regardless of enrichment. This may have been due to shifts in algal composition to dominance by large filamentous green algae. Notonecta had significant negative effects on Daphnia alone, but no interaction with nutrient enrichment was detected. These results suggest that Daphnia are not invariably superior resource competitors compared to small taxa. Though predators can have negative effects, their presence is not necessary to explain poor Daphnia performance. Rather, abiotic conditions and/or resource-based effects are probably of greater importance.","Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Steiner, CF (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Cook Coll, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",csteiner@rci.rutgers.edu; aroy@uga.edu,,,,,,49,19,20,0,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JAN,2003,490,1-3,,,,,125,134,,10.1023/A:1023470730397,,,10,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,671KK,WOS:000182463800011,,,,,2021-09-27,

Gut analyses of wetland fish, including pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus), brown bullhead (Ictalurus nebulosus), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), and common carp (Cyprinus carpio), revealed that large numbers of midge larvae (Diptera: Chironomidae) were consumed. However, our exclusion of these predatory fish from study habitats did not result in midge population increases. On the contrary, fewer epiphytic midges occurred where predatory fish had been excluded (P = 0.0043). populations of midge competitors (especially Planorbidae and Physidae) and invertebrate midge predators (especially Corixidae and Glossiphoniidae) were suppressed directly by fish, and midges that co-existed with fish apparently benefitted indirectly from those interactions. For epiphytic midge larvae, the negative direct influence of fish predation was strong, but positive indirect effects apparently were even more powerful.","Univ Georgia, Dept Entomol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Canisius Coll, Dept Biol, Buffalo, NY 14208 USA; US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Malheur Natl Wildlife Refuge, Princeton, OR 97721 USA","Batzer, DP (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Entomol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",,,,,,,27,60,67,2,45,SOC WETLAND SCIENTISTS,LAWRENCE,"810 E TENTH ST, P O BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0277-5212,,,WETLANDS,Wetlands,JUN,2000,20,2,,,,,307,312,,10.1672/0277-5212(2000)020[0307:IOFPOM]2.0.CO;2,,,6,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,326RG,WOS:000087748100007,,,,,2021-09-27,

We investigated links between predator distributions, predation intensity, rainfall, the depth of the LSL, and sessile invertebrate community structure at two sites in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand. Sessile invertebrate communities living on the rock walls of the fjord showed striking patterns of vertical zonation corresponding to the depth of the LSL. Barnacles and mussels, Mytilus edulis galloprovincialis, were most abundant at the 1-3 m depth range commonly bathed by the LSL, while sponges, bryozoans, and ascidians dominated space below it (6-18 m depth). Mussel abundance declined sharply with depth at both sites, from maxima of 52-80% cover in the LSL (3 m) to <2% cover just below the LSL (6 m). To test the hypothesis that the LSL influences the lower limit of the mussel zone by excluding predators and reducing predation from mobile invertebrates living below it, we measured predator densities and tracked predation on transplanted mussels, M. e. galloprovincialis, in the LSL (2.5 m depth) and at 3-4 depths below. Predators were most abundant just below the lower boundary of the LSL during February and April 1993. No transplanted mussels were consumed in the LSL at 2.5 m, but 20-80% of them were consumed in experiments conducted below it, indicating that the LSL represents a spatial refuge from predation. The shallowing of the LSL to 1.5 m depth during low rainfall in November 1993 provided an additional opportunity to evaluate the influence of the LSL on predation. Repeated predator surveys showed that sea stars and urchins moved up with the ascending LSL to create a pattern of high predator abundance at 2.5 m depth in November, suggesting that the shallow zone previously buffered from predation by the LSL was not a predation refuge in November. Rainfall and salinity at 2.5 m depth were inversely related. A significant regression of rainfall one day prior to salinity profiling and the depth of the LSL boundary (30 mg/g salinity) explained 61.5% of the variation in the depth of the boundary, which represented the maximum depth of the predation refuge. The regression enabled us to predict the depth of the predation refuge over a 1.5-yr period beginning in October 1992. The average depth of the refuge was 2.35 m, ranging from 1.5 to 5.6 m as a function of rainfall. Daily tidal variation increased the vertical excursion of the refuge by 0.9-1.7 m. Distinguishing between a partial predation refuge where the LSL occurred at a given depth for a part of a day, and a complete refuge where a depth occurred in the refuge for the entire day, we estimated that the 2.5-m habitat was a complete refuge during 10% of the 18-mo period and a partial predation refuge 90% of the time. The dose correspondence between the average depth of the predation refuge (2.35 m) and the depth of maximum mussel cover (3.0 m) suggests that the mussel zone is restricted to the LSL by high predation at the lower boundary of the layer. The alternative hypothesis, that the lower limit of the mussel zone (6 m depth) was determined by a failure of mussel recruitment to this depth, was tested by a l-yr recruitment experiment. Mussels recruited to the lower edge of the mussel zone at 6 m, although overall levels of mussel recruitment during May 1993-April 1994 were too low to maintain the observed zonation pattern. By increasing the spatial extent of the low-salinity layer, we speculate that changes in climatic conditions leading to increased freshwater runoff may alter salinity gradients, bathymetric distributions of predators, and the structure of shallow subtidal communities, especially in fjords.","Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Nelson, New Zealand","Witman, JD (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Box G-W, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",,,,,,,90,87,87,1,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1998,79,7,,,,,2429,2447,,10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2429:LBRSAP]2.0.CO;2,,,19,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,126NN,WOS:000076300200017,,,,,2021-09-27,

The guild of visitors was described according to richness, abundance, relative frequency and constancy. The breeding system tests indicated that D. kunthii is self-compatible. The pollination system was characterized as generalist, with 39 visitor species, from three different orders. Bees were the main group of pollinators, thus some behavioural aspects were described. The period of highest foraging activity was between 7 and 10 am. Some species presented agonistic and monopolistic behaviour. Given the behaviour and destructive potential, the Curculionidae seem to have a greater impact as seed predators than pollinators.","[Rech, Andre Rodrigo] Univ Estadual Campinas, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Lab Biossistemat, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [de Lazari Manente-Balestieri, Fatima Cristina] Fundacao Univ Fed Grande Dourados, Fac Ciencias Biol & Ambientais, Lab Abelhas Nativas, Dourados, MS, Brazil; [Absy, Maria Lucia] Inst Nacl de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Programa Prograd Bot, Lab Palinol, Manaus, AM, Brazil","Rech, AR (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Lab Biossistemat, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",arech2003@yahoo.com.br,,,CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [472563/2006-8],"We thank Dr. Joao Maria Franco Camargo (in memorian) for identifying bees; Dr. Antonio Carlos Webber for suggestions on the first version of this manuscript; Drs.

Although intraguild prey are hypothesized to exhibit faster growth rates than intraguild predators and, therefore, outgrow predation risk through time, intraguild predation also is associated with significant increases in predator growth rates that are hypothesized to increase the potential for future predation. Given these conflicting hypotheses, how predation among amphibian larvae early in development should influence size disparities and ontogenetic shifts in predation risk is unclear. To clarify the effects of intraguild predation on predator and prey growth, we quantified size variation among larval salamanders (Ambystomatidae) in forested ephemeral ponds while concurrently monitoring seasonal patterns of intraguild predation through gut content analyses. Intraguild predation had no discernible effect on either interspecific size disparities between intraguild predators and prey, or intraspecific size variation within predator populations, and factors of larval density, tadpole density, and pond area were more important than larval size variation in predicting IGP. Our results do not support previous assertions regarding the consequences of intraguild predation for predator-prey size disparities, because top predators not actively engaging in IGP appeared to maintain growth rates equivalent to successful conspecific IG predators, and the frequency of intraguild predation did not significantly change during larval ontogeny. The lack of consistent increases or decreases in predator-prey size disparities suggests that intraguild prey may not experience predictable ontogenetic shifts in intraguild predation risk.","[Mott, Cy L.; Sparling, Donald W.] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Cooperat Wildlife Res Lab, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Mott, Cy L.] Valdosta State Univ, Dept Biol, Valdosta, GA 31698 USA","Mott, CL (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Cooperat Wildlife Res Lab, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.; Mott, CL (corresponding author), Valdosta State Univ, Dept Biol, Valdosta, GA 31698 USA.",clmott@valdosta.edu,,,Delyte and Dorothy Morris Fellowship,"We thank S.

The nature of such linkages is, however, not always an obvious one. Here we examined the influence of rocky reefs on nearby sandy macrofaunal assemblages. A preliminary descriptive study confirmed the hypothesis that sediment granulometry differs in relation to distance to rocky reefs and so did the macrofaunal assemblage composition, and relative abundance of three of the most abundant taxa, and that this effect was generally consistent among locations. In addition, there was a significant effect of sediment structure on community structure of benthic assemblages. A subsequent manipulative experiment tested, in an interactive way, the effects of predation and sediment grain size in structuring macrofaunal assemblages adjacent to a rocky reef. At the scale of the assemblage (richness and composition), results showed that there was an effect of sand granulometry and distance to the reef, while predation had no effect. Predation affected the abundance of one of the most abundant taxa (un-identified amphipod sp.1) but this effect was consistent adjacent and away from the reef. Sand granulometry had no influence on the numbers of the most abundant taxa, while the abundance of two of these taxa (Catapaguroides timidus and Ervilia castanea) still varied according to distance to the reef. This study adds to the wider literature by suggesting that there can be important movements of materials and organisms from rocky reefs to adjacent soft-bottom habitats but that rock-associated predators and sand granulometry may have a limited influence in structuring the small-bodied sediment infauna close to reefs. This study also stresses the need for caution when ascribing the importance of ecological processes based on descriptive studies alone, even when results seem ecologically logical.

Generalist fish species are recognised as important couplers of benthic and pelagic food-web compartments in lakes. However, interspecific niche segregation and individual specialisation may limit the potential for generalistic feeding behaviour. 2. We studied summer habitat use, stomach contents and stable isotopic compositions of the generalist feeder Arctic charr coexisting with its common resource competitor brown trout in five subarctic lakes in northern Norway to reveal population-level and individual-level niche plasticity. 3. Charr and trout showed partial niche segregation in all five lakes. Charr used all habitat types and a wide variety of invertebrate prey including zooplankton, whereas trout fed mainly on insects in the littoral zone. Hence, charr showed a higher potential to promote habitat and food-web coupling compared to littoral-dwelling trout. 4. The level of niche segregation between charr and trout and between pelagic-caught and littoral-caught charr depended on the prevailing patterns of interspecific and intraspecific resource competition. The two fish species had partially overlapping trophic niches in one lake where charr numerically dominated the fish community, whereas the most segregated niches occurred in lakes where trout were more abundant. 5. In general, pelagic-caught charr had substantially narrower dietary and isotopic niches and relied less on littoral carbon sources compared to littoral-caught conspecifics that included generalist as well as specialised benthivorous and planktivorous individuals. Despite the partially specialised planktivorous niche and thus reduced potential of pelagic-dwelling charr to promote benthicpelagic coupling, the isotopic compositions of both charr subpopulations suggested a significant reliance on both littoral and pelagic carbon sources in all five study lakes. 6. Our study demonstrates that both interspecific niche segregation between and individual trophic specialisation within generalist fish species can constrain food-web coupling and alter energy mobilisation to top consumers in subarctic lakes. Nevertheless, pelagic and littoral habitats and food-web compartments may still be highly integrated due to the potentially plastic foraging behaviour of top consumers.","[Eloranta, Antti P.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Knudsen, Rune; Amundsen, Per-Arne] Univ Tromso, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway","Eloranta, AP (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",antti.eloranta@jyu.fi,"Eloranta, Antti Pekka/AAA-1426-2020","Amundsen, Per-Arne/0000-0002-2203-8216; Eloranta, Antti/0000-0002-8893-0135",Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation; Ellen and Artturi Nyyssonen Foundation; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission,"We are grateful to Cesilie Lien, Laina Dalsbo, Emmanuela Daza Secco and other people helping with the field and laboratory work.

Various rotifer species exhibit polymorphism in lorica and spine morphology in the presence of predators and competitors, which effectively increases their defence competition capacity. This study compared life-history parameters between long-spined morph (LSM) and short-spined morph (SSM) of Keratella tropica at three temperatures. The results showed that both morphs showed significantly higher intrinsic rate of population increase at 25 degrees C than those at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The intrinsic rate of population increase was significantly lower in LSM than SSM at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C, and the net reproductive rate was significantly lower in LSM than SSM at 30 degrees C. These results suggested that K. tropica had cost on development of long spines, which, however, was dependent on temperature. Moreover, the competition outcome of LSM and SSM with Moina macrocopa were investigated at three densities of Scenedesmus obliquus (0.5 x 10(6), 1.0 x 10(6) and 2.0 x 10(6) cells/mL) and three initial densities of M. macrocopa (0.1, 0.3 and 0.9 ind./mL), revealing that both LSM and SSM populations decreased significantly at all tested algal densities and Moina levels. LSM showed higher population growth rate than SSM at lower algal density (0.5 x 10(6) cells/mL) and higher Moina densities (0.3 and 0.9 ind./mL), which suggested that LSM could be more effective to defend M. macrocopa. Three-way analysis of variance showed no significant effects of algal density on population growth rate of K. tropica, but interaction between algal density and M. macrocopa density significantly affected its population growth rate.","[Ge, Ya-Li; Yu, Xiao-Jing; Zhan, Rong; Yu, Jin-Hang; Xi, Yi-Long] Anhui Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Prov Lab Conservat & Utilizat Important Biol Reso, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Gen] Shenzhen GenProMetab Biotechnol Co Ltd, Shenzhen 518101, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Xi, YL (corresponding author), Anhui Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Prov Lab Conservat & Utilizat Important Biol Reso, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China.; Zhang, G (corresponding author), Shenzhen GenProMetab Biotechnol Co Ltd, Shenzhen 518101, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",ylxi1965@126.com; zhanggen1988@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31400352]; Provincial Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province of ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [1408085MC66]; Key Foundation for Excellent Youth in Higher Education of Anhui Province of China [2013SQRL013ZD]; Foundation of the Provincial Key Laboratory of Biotic Environment and Ecological Safety in Anhui; Foundation of the Provincial Key Laboratory of Conservation and Utilization for Important Biological Resources in Anhui,"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China(#31400352), the Provincial Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province of China(#1408085MC66), the Key Foundation for Excellent Youth in Higher Education of Anhui Province of China (#2013SQRL013ZD), the Foundation of the Provincial Key Laboratory of Biotic Environment and Ecological Safety in Anhui, the Foundation of the Provincial Key Laboratory of Conservation and Utilization for Important Biological Resources in Anhui.

However, its application to invertebrates, specifically biocontrol agents, is rather new and there is still a lack of information on breeding parameters of key traits. In this study, we address two important traits for biocontrol, i.e., the phytophagy and zoophagy of a population of the zoophytophagous predatorNesidiocoris tenuis. Here, we determine whether there is variation in these two traits and the proportion of that variation that has a genetic basis. Our results revealed the presence of genetic variation in both traits for this population. Genetic variation observed in zoophagy was larger than that found in phytophagy. These findings are relevant to the field of genetic improvement of biocontrol agents, since it reports quantitative values necessary for potential breeding programs. Moreover, our results suggest that if such variation is maintained in larger populations, it might be possible that selection for more zoophagous individuals could entail a reduction of the damages derived from its phytophagy. Furthermore, this study sheds light on genetic tools that could be applied to improve the biocontrol practice and, consequently, contribute to a more sustainable agriculture. Zoophytophagous predators provide biocontrol services in various major crops of modern horticulture due to the combination of its predatory capacity and the induction of plant defenses derived from its phytophagy. However, under certain conditions of prey scarcity, these natural enemies can inflict plant damage. Exploitation of genetic variation and subsequent selective breeding on foraging traits is a potential alternative to overcome this inconvenience. In this study, we quantified the genetic variation of phytophagy and zoophagy ofNesidiocoristenuis(Reuter) (Hemiptera: Miridae), a zoophytophagous predator widely used in tomato crops to suppress key pests. We compared nine isofemale lines on their capacity to produce necrotic rings and wilting on tomato plants as a proxy for phytophagy, as well as their efficacy to prey onEphestia kuehniellaZeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) eggs, as a proxy for zoophagy. Differences between isofemale lines in phytophagy and zoophagy indicated a genetic basis. Variation found in the zoophagy levels was larger than that in phytophagy levels. Our results showed that there is a genetic basis for the variation observed in the feeding behavior of isofemale lines ofN.tenuis, highlighting the potential importance of selective breeding for such traits of biocontrol interest.","[Chinchilla-Ramirez, Milena; Perez-Hedo, Meritxell; Urbaneja, Alberto] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Unidad Entomol UJI IVIA, CV 315,Km 10,7, Moncada 46113, Valencia, Spain; [Pannebakker, Bart A.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Genet, Droevendaalsesteeg 1, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands","Chinchilla-Ramirez, M (corresponding author), Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Unidad Entomol UJI IVIA, CV 315,Km 10,7, Moncada 46113, Valencia, Spain.",chinchilla.milena@gmail.com; mperezh@ivia.es; bart.pannebakker@wur.nl; aurbaneja@ivia.es,"URBANEJA, ALBERTO/AAW-6198-2020; Perez-Hedo, Meritxell/O-6441-2019; Urbaneja, Alberto/C-9071-2011; Pannebakker, Bart/D-3823-2012","URBANEJA, ALBERTO/0000-0001-5986-3685; Perez-Hedo, Meritxell/0000-0003-3411-0761; Urbaneja, Alberto/0000-0001-5986-3685; Chinchilla-Ramirez, Milena/0000-0002-1680-9862; Pannebakker, Bart/0000-0001-8503-3896","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme Marie Sklodowska-Curie [641456]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO [RTA2017-00073-00-00]; Conselleria d'Agricultura, Pesca i Alimentacio de la Generalitat ValencianaGeneralitat Valenciana; INIA Spain (Subprogram DOC-INIA-CCAA)","This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme Marie Sklodowska-Curie, grant agreement No. 641456, the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO (RTA2017-00073-00-00) and by the Conselleria d'Agricultura, Pesca i Alimentacio de la Generalitat Valenciana.

This has received little attention in dabbling ducks so we investigated experimentally the shape of the functional response of mallard feeding on poultry pellets, and assessed the influence of several factors such as the size of food items, sex or individual performance on this functional response. Individual differences in intake rate are of crucial important in group or gregarious foraging species. We used two approaches of the functional response: 1) the relation between feeding rate (pellets/s) and pellet densities (pellts/m(2)), and 2) the relationship between instantaneous intake rate (g/s) and biomass density (g/m(2)). For both approaches, we found that the Type II functional response gave better estimates than a Type I linear functional response but explained only a third of the variance. Our results show that pellet size has a large effect on instantaneous intake rate. The comparison of the functional response parameters suggest that handling time per prey mag. not reflect the real constraints on intake rate, but that handling time per gram ingested may be more appropriate to integrate the effect of item size in the functional response. We then discuss the possible mechanisms involved. We also found individual variations in the Functional response for each of the experiment, with some consistency in the hierarchy regarding feeding efficiency. We did not find any differences between males and females. Our results provide an evaluation of individual variations in intake rate in interference-free conditions, which has rarely been done, and call for more controlled experiments to allow a finer understanding of the mechanisms of food acquisition in dabbling ducks.","Ctr Etud Biol Chize, CNRS, UPR 1934, F-79360 Beauvoir Sur Niort, France","Fritz, H (corresponding author), Ctr Etud Biol Chize, CNRS, UPR 1934, F-79360 Beauvoir Sur Niort, France.",fritzh@cebc.cnrs.fr,"Fritz, Herve/D-1729-2014","Fritz, Herve/0000-0002-7106-3661",,,,42,25,26,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2001,93,3,,,,,488,496,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.930314.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,452YK,WOS:000169887100014,,,,,2021-09-27,

The littoral catch per unit effort (CPUE) of charr had decreased by 90% in 1990 and then increased to about 50% of the initial level by 1994 while the pelagic CPUE had decreased to zero. Growth in both charr and trout greatly improved when the charr density had decreased, and large fish of both species appeared in the catches. These large fish became predators on small charr in the littoral zone. The incidence of trout increased from below 1% to 15% from 1988 to 1999 after a brief peak at 30% in 1992 and 1993. The charr population attained a bimodal size distribution and did not return to the stunted state during the 10 years following the intensive fishing period. The mass removal experiment showed that it is possible to change the structure of a charr population by intensive fishing. Predation on small charr from cannibals and large trout was probably essential for maintaining the new population structure. An increase in the growth of young charr from 1995 to 1997 was related to a high consumption of Daphnia and Eurycercus. Rapid changes in the growth of charr followed the density fluctuations in sticklebacks, which show large annual variations in this system; the rapid changes in charr growth were probably caused by variations in the competition intensity for cladoceran prey between young charr and sticklebacks. Twenty years of data has provided important information, but even more time is needed to follow the long-term trends in northern lakes such as Takvatn.","Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, Dept Marine & Freshwater Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; Polar Environm Ctr, Norwegian Inst Nat Res, N-9296 Tromso, Norway","Klemetsen, A (corresponding author), Univ Tromso, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, Dept Marine & Freshwater Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",andersk@nfh.uit.no,,"Amundsen, Per-Arne/0000-0002-2203-8216",,,,27,48,55,2,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

An Experimental Test in Dumpling Squid (Euprymna tasmanica),PLOS ONE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,COPULATION DURATION; MULTIPLE PATERNITY; FEMALE CHOICE; MATE CHOICE; COURTSHIP; REPRODUCTION; CUTTLEFISH; DECISIONS; COMPETITION; SURVIVAL,"Introduction: One of the most important trade-offs for many animals is that between survival and reproduction. This is particularly apparent when mating increases the risk of predation, either by increasing conspicuousness, reducing mobility or inhibiting an individual's ability to detect predators. Individuals may mitigate the risk of predation by altering their reproductive behavior (e.g. increasing anti-predator responses to reduce conspicuousness). The degree to which individuals modulate their reproductive behavior in relation to predation risk is difficult to predict because both the optimal investment in current and future reproduction (due to life-history strategies) and level of predation risk may differ between the sexes and among species. Here, we investigate the effect of increased predation risk on the reproductive behavior of dumpling squid (Euprymna tasmanica). Results: Females, but not males, showed a substantial increase in the number of inks (an anti-predator behavior) before mating commenced in the presence of a predator (sand flathead Platycephalus bassensis). However, predation risk did not affect copulation duration, the likelihood of mating, female anti-predator behavior during or after mating or male anti-predator behavior at any time. Conclusions: Inking is a common anti-predator defense in cephalopods, thought to act like a smokescreen, decoy or distraction. Female dumpling squid are probably using this form of defense in response to the increase in predation risk prior to mating. Conversely, males were undeterred by the increase in predation risk. A lack of change in these variables may occur if the benefit of completing mating outweighs the risk of predation. Prioritizing current reproduction, even under predation risk, can occur when the chance of future reproduction is low, there is substantial energetic investment into mating, or the potential fitness payoffs of mating are high.","[Franklin, Amanda M.; Squires, Zoe E.; Stuart-Fox, Devi] Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia","Franklin, AM (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",amanda.franklin@tufts.edu,,"Franklin, Amanda/0000-0002-8650-8344; Stuart-Fox, Devi/0000-0003-3362-1412",Hermon Slade Foundation [HSF 08/2],"Hermon Slade Foundation, HSF 08/2, http://www.hermonslade.org.au/, DS-F.

We studied the association between preference and performance of the generalist predator Orius laevigatus with respect to two prey species: spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) and western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis). Under ample prey supply, the predators had higher maximum reproductive success (measured as intrinsic population growth rate r) on thrips than on spider mites; hence thrips represent a higher prey quality to the bugs. This was at odds with the observed preference of the predatory bug for plants (patches) with high densities of spider mites to plants with moderate densities of thrips in release-recapture experiments. Thus, prey quality does not suffice to explain the preference of predators for plants with prey. The quality of a patch as an oviposition site (i.e. the number of eggs produced on a patch per bug per day) also did not match preference patterns. Hence, patch preference was not correlated to prey quality or oviposition rate on prey patches. However, patch productivity, i.e. the total number of offspring surviving until adulthood that can be produced by one female on a patch, was correlated with preference. This was further tested by offering the predators a choice between plants with high densities of spider mites and plants with high densities of thrips in an independent set of release-recapture experiments. These two types of prey patches were found equivalent in terms of patch productivity. Indeed, the predators showed no preference for either of the two types of patches, which is in agreement with our predictions. This suggests that the predatory bugs select patches based on patch productivity rather than on prey quality or oviposition rate on a patch.","Univ Amsterdam, Sect Populat Biol, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands; EPAMIG, Agr & Livestock Res Enterprise Minas Gerais, Vicosa, MG, Brazil","Janssen, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Sect Populat Biol, POB 94084, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",janssen@science.uva.nl,"Janssen, Arne/B-2657-2009; Venzon, Madelaine/C-5856-2014","Janssen, Arne/0000-0001-5075-5303; Venzon, Madelaine/0000-0001-9184-6818",,,,37,47,58,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,APR,2002,97,1,,,,,116,124,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970112.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,559JC,WOS:000176022200012,,,,,2021-09-27,

An individual-based survey was performed during four years in four populations, which contained plants in both open habitat and woodland. We detected marked spatial and temporal variation among and within populations in foliage herbivory (by insects) and pre-dispersal seed predation (by insects, rodents and Roe Deer). Foliage herbivory decreased with plant demographic stages in open habitats, from seedlings to reproductive individuals, but no significant trend was detected in woodland habitats. This may be due to different demographic origin of larger vegetative plants in this habitat. Depending on demographic stage, herbivory was higher in open habitats or not significantly different between habitats. This suggests differences in herbivore abundance in different habitats within sites. Pre-dispersal seed predation remained weak and did not depend on habitat. We did not detect any consequence of foliage herbivory on seedling mortality and individual growth in our study. Our results illustrate the need to investigate plant-herbivore interactions over several years in distinct populations in order to more accurately evaluate herbivore impact on plant population dynamics.

Despite a large body of research, the cascading effects of predator removal on ecosystem functions are not as well understood. Developing microcosm experiments, we explored food web changes in trophic structure and ecosystem functioning following biomass removal of top predators in representative temperate and tropical rock pool communities that contained similar assemblages of zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. We observed changes in species abundances following predator removal in both temperate and tropical communities, in line with expected inverse effects of a trophic cascade, where predation release benefits the predator's preys and competitors and impacts the preys of the latter. We also observed several changes at the community and ecosystem levels including a decrease in total abundance and mean trophic level of the community, and changes in chlorophyll-a and total dissolved particles. Our results also showed an increase in variability of both community and ecosystem processes following the removal of predators. These results illustrate how predator removal can lead to inverse trophic cascades both in structural and functioning properties, and can increase variability of ecosystem processes. Although observed patterns were consistent between tropical and temperate communities following an inverse cascade pattern, changes were more pronounced in the temperate community. Therefore, aquatic food webs may have inherent traits that condition ecosystem responses to changes in top-down trophic control and render some aquatic ecosystems especially sensitive to the removals of top predators.","[Coll, Marta] CSIC, ICM, Inst Marine Sci, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Coll, Marta; Hargadon, Kevin] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada","Coll, M (corresponding author), CSIC, ICM, Inst Marine Sci, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",mcoll@icm.csic.es,"Coll, Marta/A-9488-2012","Coll, Marta/0000-0001-6235-5868",European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [FP7-PEOPLE-2007-4-1-IOF],"MC was supported financially by the European Commission Marie Curie Post-doctoral Fellowship through the International Outgoing Fellowships (Call FP7-PEOPLE-2007-4-1-IOF) for the ECOFUN project.

In order to improve the forage availability for livestock small mammals have been the target of eradication worldwide. However, in most of these regions the ecosystems are governed by non-equilibrium processes which have overwhelming influence on livestock densities. Due to these ecosystems' highly variable natural environment, field observations are usually insufficient to describe the whole system as they usually are too short to cover all significant states. Thus we used field information on processes and additional literature information to drive a dynamic model simulating forage competition between the Mongolian pika (Ochotona pallasi) and livestock in the Mongolian South Gobi. The regulatory mechanisms of pika's territoriality and herders' migration strategy as implemented in the model proved to be sufficient to keep the densities of both herbivore groups within the observed and denoted limits. Both groups can coexist because each has exclusive access to a forage resource unavailable to the other group: pika have the ability to bite down the vegetation deeper than livestock can while the herders drive livestock to better pasture grounds out of reach of the pika when forage is scarce. Nevertheless, both groups react to the frequent periods of forage scarcity and thus indirectly interact via forage competition. The model shows that the large increase in livestock numbers after the Mongolian socio-economic transformation cannot be singularly explained by favourable weather conditions during that period. Only a change in herding strategies with higher livestock densities can explain the observed increase in numbers. However, the larger numbers were short-lived as the risky strategy succumbed to adverse weather conditions in the late 1990s and livestock numbers crashed in reality As well as in the model. This indicates that in the non-equilibrium system livestock numbers are regularly forced well below the average carrying capacity. Thus, livestock densities are largely controlled by the variability of the abiotic conditions - namely precipitation - and previous levels of livestock densities cannot be increased in the long term as herding strategies are already optimised.

This is the first laboratory study that we are aware of that indicates that a zooplankton species from the Great Lakes responds behaviorally to an invertebrate predator. Our findings support the hypothesis that changes in vertical distribution of zooplankton associated with changes in invertebrate predator density, observed in previous Great Lakes studies, is due to behavioral responses to reduce predation risk. It is important to understand and quantify such responses, because predator-induced changes in prey behavior represent trait-mediated interactions that can potentially strongly affect prey growth rates, and indirectly affect resources, competitors, and predators of the prey.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA","Peacor, SD (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 13 Nat Resources Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",Peacor@msu.edu,,"Vanderploeg, Henry/0000-0003-1358-8475",,,,55,5,6,0,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0380-1330,,,J GREAT LAKES RES,J.

We observed foraging behaviors of 3 phases (juvenile, intermediate, terminal) of 10 parrotfish species on 34 reefs in the middle Florida Keys (USA) that varied in coral and algal composition. Cluster analysis of Manly's alpha electivity indices revealed 3 functional feeding groups that differed in their selectivity of turf, calcareous, and fleshy algal communities as preferred foraging habitats. Juvenile parrotfishes of different foraging groups had similar foraging preferences that diverged with maturation. Preferences for turf algal communities increased with increasing turf algal cover but were not influenced by parrotfish biomass. In contrast, preferences for fleshy algal communities decreased with increasing parrotfish biomass. These results suggest that parrotfish species have different foraging preferences, which may vary with ontogeny, algal abundance, and parrotfish biomass. Thus, efforts to increase parrotfish biomass may not always lead to a predictable decrease in algal abundance.","[Smith, Kylie M.; Quirk-Royal, Brandt E.; Drake-Lavelle, Kelan; Childress, Michael J.] Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA","Smith, KM (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",kylie4@g.clemson.edu,"Childress, Michael/AAW-2340-2020",,Clemson University Creative Inquiry Initiative; ACC Fellowship for Innovation and Creativity; International Women's Fishing Association; Sigma-Xi; Animal Behavior Society; Clemson University,"This research was made possible by the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (permit no.

However, emergent genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic evidence now challenges this role to be at best equivocal to other processess. Cnidaria are arguably the most ancient phylum of the extant metazoa that are venomous and such provide a definitive ancestral anchor to examine the evolution of this trait. Methods: Here we compare predicted toxins from the translated genome of the coral Acropora digitifera to putative toxins revealed by proteomic analysis of soluble proteins discharged from nematocysts, to determine the extent to which gene duplications contribute to venom innovation in this reef-building coral species. A new bioinformatics tool called HHCompare was developed to detect potential gene duplications in the genomic data, which is made freely available (https://github.com/rgacesa/HHCompare). Results: A total of 55 potential toxin encoding genes could be predicted from the A. digitifera genome, of which 36 (65 %) had likely arisen by gene duplication as evinced using the HHCompare tool and verified using two standard phylogeny methods. Surprisingly, only 22 % (12/55) of the potential toxin repertoire could be detected following rigorous proteomic analysis, for which only half (6/12) of the toxin proteome could be accounted for as peptides encoded by the gene duplicates. Biological activities of these toxins are dominatedby putative phospholipases and toxic peptidases. Conclusions: Gene expansions in A. digitifera venom are the most extensive yet described in any venomous animal, and gene duplication plays a significant role leading to toxin diversification in this coral species. Since such low numbers of toxins were detected in the proteome, it is unlikely that the venom is evolving rapidly by prey-driven positive natural selection. Rather we contend that the venom has a defensive role deterring predation or harm from interspecific competition and overgrowth by fouling organisms. Factors influencing translation of toxin encoding genes perhaps warrants more profound experimental consideration.","[Gacesa, Ranko; Long, Paul F.] Kings Coll London, Inst Pharmaceut Sci, London SE1 9NH, England; [Chung, Ray; Ward, Malcolm] Kings Coll London, Prote Facil, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, London SE5 8AF, England; [Dunn, Simon R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Coral Reefs Ecosyst Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Weston, Andrew J.] UCL Sch Pharm, Mass Spectrometry Lab, London WC1N 1AX, England; [Jaimes-Becerra, Adrian; Marques, Antonio C.; Morandini, Andre C.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Zool, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Marques, Antonio C.] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Biol Marinha, BR-11600000 Sao Sebastiao, Brazil; [Hranueli, Daslav; Starcevic, Antonio] Univ Zagreb, Fac Food Technol & Biotechnol, Sect Bioinformat, Dept Biochem Engn, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Long, Paul F.] Kings Coll London, Dept Chem, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Long, Paul F.] Kings Coll London, Brazil Inst, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Long, Paul F.] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Ciencias Farmaceut, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil","Long, PF (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Inst Pharmaceut Sci, 150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England.",paul.long@kcl.ac.uk,"Morandini, Andre Carrara/A-9892-2012; Morandini, Andre Carrara/AAC-2320-2020; Gacesa, Ranko/AAG-5358-2019; Starcevic, Antonio/AAB-9379-2021; Marques, Antonio Carlos/E-8049-2011","Morandini, Andre Carrara/0000-0003-3747-8748; Morandini, Andre Carrara/0000-0003-3747-8748; Gacesa, Ranko/0000-0003-2119-0539; Marques, Antonio Carlos/0000-0002-2884-0541","United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC grant) [G82144A]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2010/50174-7, 2011/50242-5]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq grant)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [301039/2013-5]; Universidade de Sao Paulo (USP grant) [13.1.1502.9.8]; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission [1406848] Funding Source: researchfish","We are indebted to Dr. Walter C.

Since many natural enemies of this aphid have been recorded, biological control of this pest might be a viable alternative to manage it. Selected plant species in field margins might help to provide the natural enemies with food sources to enhance their fitness. This study aimed to investigate if sweet alyssum, Lobularia maritima (L.) (Brassicaceae), is a potential food source for the parasitoid Aphidius ervi Haliday (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and the predator Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), and whether this flower could contribute to enhance the biological control of M. persicae. Volatiles produced by alyssum, with and without flowers, attracted both natural enemies. This attractiveness to alyssum flowers was disrupted when compared with peach shoots recently infested with a relatively low number of aphids. When aphids were absent, parasitoids exposed to alyssum survived longer than those that fed on a sugar solution or on water. In the case of the predator, alyssum flowers did not benefit longevity since the nectaries were inaccessible to females. However, our results provide evidence that A. aphidimyza would be able to feed on nectar if accessible. The floral resource did not improve the reproductive capacity of the two natural enemies, but the 10% sugar solution increased the egg load of the predator. Provision of other sugar resources, such as flowers with exposed nectaries and extra floral nectar may also be a viable option to improve the biological control of M. persicae.","[Aparicio, Yahana; Gabarra, Rosa; Arno, Judit] IRTA, Sustainable Plant Protect Program, Ctra Cabrils Km 2, Barcelona 08348, Spain","Arno, J (corresponding author), IRTA, Sustainable Plant Protect Program, Ctra Cabrils Km 2, Barcelona 08348, Spain.",judit.arno@irta.cat,"ARNO, JUDIT/I-7045-2012","ARNO, JUDIT/0000-0001-6318-6867","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiviness [AGL2013-49164-C2-2-R, AGL2016-77373-C2-1-R]; CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya; CONACyT (Mexico)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)","This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiviness (Projects AGL2013-49164-C2-2-R and AGL2016-77373-C2-1-R) and the CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya.

The red fox expansion correlates with climate warming, and the ultimate determinant of the outcome of the competition between the two species is hypothesized to be climate. We conducted aerial and ground fox den surveys in the northern Yukon (Herschel Island and the coastal mainland) to investigate the relative abundance of red and arctic foxes over the last four decades. This region has undergone the most intense warming observed in North America, and we hypothesized that this climate change led to increasing dominance of red fox over arctic fox. Results of recent surveys fall within the range of previous ones, indicating little change in the relative abundance of the two species. North Yukon fox dens are mostly occupied by arctic fox, with active red fox dens occurring sympatrically. While vegetation changes have been reported, there is no indication that secondary productivity and food abundance for foxes have increased. Our study shows that in the western Arctic of North America, where climate warming was intense, the competitive balance between red and arctic foxes changed little in 40 years. Our results challenge the hypotheses linking climate to red fox expansion, and we discuss how climate warming's negative effects on predators may be overriding positive effects of milder temperatures and longer growing seasons.","[Gallant, Daniel; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Chaire Rech Canada Conservat Ecosyst Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Gallant, Daniel; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Nord, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada; [Reid, Donald G.] Wildlife Conservat Soc Canada, Whitehorse, YT Y1A 5T2, Canada","Gallant, D (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Chaire Rech Canada Conservat Ecosyst Nord, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada.",daniel.gallant@uqar.qc.ca; beru9664@hotmail.com,"Berteaux, Dominique/J-3276-2016; Gallant, Daniel/B-9118-2015","Berteaux, Dominique/0000-0003-2728-5985; Gallant, Daniel/0000-0002-3170-0523","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; International Polar Year program of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada; ArcticNet Network of Centers of Excellence of Canada; Wildlife Conservation Society Canada; Polar Continental Shelf Program (PCSP), Natural Resources Canada; Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs; Aurora Research Institute; Canadian Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for Innovation; Centre d'Etudes Nordiques (CEN); Northern Scientific Training Program (Indian and Northern Affairs Canada); Universite du Quebec a Rimouski","We thank Guillaume Szor, Francois Racine, Francis Taillefer, Andrew Fehr, Helen Slama, Alice Kenney, Elizabeth Hofer, Charles J.

In the first 50 years post-wildfire, woody browse availability in upland forests increase in quantity and quality for generalist ungulates, such as moose (Alces alces) and whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Greater favorable habitat for these generalist ungulates results in increases to their respective populations, and through apparent competition, leads to increases in wolf populations; thus, causing unsustainable levels of predation on threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations. However, the duration of post-wildfire browse availability is not well understood in the Boreal Plains of Alberta as previous studies are primarily from the Taiga and Boreal Shield where vegetation communities are structurally different. This study examines the changes in winter browse richness, evenness, abundance, and community composition, as well as their use (browse levels) by moose and white-tailed deer, over a 150-year post-wildfire period. In the summer of 2019, we collected vegetation and ungulate browsing data from 164 upland and lowland forest sites in northeastern Alberta, Canada. We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and ordinal logistic regression to examine changes in browse measures. Species richness and evenness showed a double peak at 10?25 years and 90 years post-wildfire in mixedwood forests, as a result of fluctuations in browse palatability, while browse abundance was constant. In contrast, black spruce and lowland forests had similar species richness, evenness and abundance over the 150-year chronosequence. However, browse abundance in lowland forests was higher than mixedwood forests, but this consisted of low palatable browse. Browsing was significant in jack pine forests, mixedwood forests and poor fens; coniferous saplings were generally avoided, whereas 35?65% of available deciduous saplings were browsed. Understanding post-wildfire succession and ungulate browsing in post-wildfire forests provides useful information for managing alternative prey populations necessary for long-term woodland caribou conservation.","[Routh, Melanie R.; Nielsen, Scott E.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 751 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada","Routh, MR (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 751 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",routh@ualberta.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship (CGS-M); NSERC Collaborative Research and Development GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [CRDPJ 498955-16],"This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship (CGS-M); and the NSERC Collaborative Research and Development Grant (CRDPJ 498955-16).

This made it possible to study interactions with the meiobenthos (in terms of predation, food competition and food enhancement). The density of the meiobenthic taxa and nematode genera and a broad range of abiotic variables were followed in a depth profile over 1 yr of caging. There was a significant exclusion effect in the upper sediment layer for total meiofauna, nematodes and oligochaetes during the first 2 mo and for copepods during the last 6 mo of caging. The density of the most common predatory and microalgae-feeding nematodes in particular tended to increase in the surface layers as well as the percentage of muddy detritus and pigment concentration. Food competition with the epibenthos seems to be most important in structuring the nematode community. This is suggested by the parallel exclusion effect on muddy detritus, pigments and nematode composition and the lack of evidence for upward nematode migration in the cage during the experiment. The same can be concluded for the oligochaetes, whereas copepod densities are believed to be controlled more by predation. These findings indicate that the meiofauna community of the C. tagal mangrove sediment (consisting of about 95% nematodes and oligochaetes) is part of a rather isolated, detrital food web with only minor predator-prey interactions with the epibenthos.","KENYA MARINE & FISHERIES RES INST, MOMBASA, KENYA","Schrijvers, J (corresponding author), STATE UNIV GHENT, DEPT MORPHOL SYSTEMAT & ECOL, MARINE BIOL SECT, KL LEDEGANCKSTR 35, B-9000 GHENT, BELGIUM.",,,,,,,55,28,30,1,9,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Understanding species occurrence in areas dominated by nonnative vegetation is important to determine whether management should be implemented. Saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) is one of the most prevalent and invasive nonnative woody species in riparian areas in the southwestern United States, and it can alter vegetation structure. Little is known about how meso (medium) and large carnivores and herbivores use or avoid stands of saltcedar. We investigated mammal activity in 3 riparian forest types along the San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona: nonnative saltcedar, native mesquite (Prosopis spp.) woodland, and native cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and willow (Salix gooddingii) forest. We determined mammal use, diversity, and occupancy across riparian forest types. We sampled mammals along approximately 25 river kilometers between July 2017 and October 2018, using 18 trail cameras (6 per forest type) spaced 1 km apart. We summarized environmental variables around the cameras and reduced the variables to 4 components using a principal component analysis. We observed 14 meso and large mammal species, including bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), and white-nosed coati (Nasua narica) over 7692 trap nights. Occupancy of some species may have been influenced by the environmental components, but models showed high standard errors, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Our results do not indicate that nonnative saltcedar was actively avoided. There were no discernible differences in detections of species or taxonomic groups among forest types; however, the highest species diversity was in mesquite woodlands. We did not find evidence of competitively dominant predators (coyotes and mountain lions [Puma concolor]) altering the temporal activity patterns and forest use of subordinate species (gray fox [Urocyon cinereoargenteus] and bobcat), as each pair used the same riparian space at similar times.","[Herzog, Cheyenne J.; Bateman, Heather L.] Arizona State Univ, Coll Integrat Sci & Arts, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA","Bateman, HL (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Coll Integrat Sci & Arts, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",Heather.L.Bateman@asu.edu,,,BOR [R17AP00162]; Audubon Society Apacheria Research Fellowship,"We thank Stan Cunningham and Jesse Lewis for suggestions regarding study design and analysis and Fabio Albuquerque for assistance with ArcGIS and NDVI measurements.

We compared diets of recently translocated Mexican wolves (C. l. baileyi) with diets of resident coyotes in Arizona and New Mexico, USA. We systematically collected scats during 2000 and 2001. Coyote diet was composed mostly of mammalian species, followed by vegetation and insects. Elk (Cervus elaphus) was the most common item in coyote scats. Mexican wolf diet had a higher proportion of large mammals and fewer small mammals than coyote diet; however, elk was also the most common food item in Mexican wolf scats. Our results suggest that Mexican wolf diet was more similar to coyote diet than previously reported, but coyotes had more seasonal variation. Considering results in other areas, we expect that Mexican wolves will have a negative impact on coyotes through direct mortality and possibly competition. Reintroduction of Mexican wolves may have great impacts on communities by changing relationships among other predators and their prey.","[Carrera, Rogelio; Ballard, Warren; Wallace, Mark C.; Villalobos, Carlos; Wester, David B.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Nat Resources Management, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Gipson, Philip] Kansas State Univ, US Geol Survey, Kansas Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Kelly, Brian T.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Montana Field Stn, Cheyenne, WY 82001 USA; [Krausman, Paul R.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Carrera, R (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Nat Resources Management, Box 42125, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",warren.ballard@ttu.edu,"Wallace, Mark C/A-1263-2010",,,,,41,20,20,1,92,WILDLIFE SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2197 USA",0022-541X,,,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

The closure modeling approach, which accounts for both fluctuations and spatial means, is an effective way to model the impact of heterogeneity on plankton ecosystem dynamics. The hypothesis Environmental Heterogeneity (EH) supports higher trophic levels in plankton ecosystems and may sustain biodiversity was previously proposed based on the analysis of NP, NPZ and NPZD plankton models. The present study extends previous results by analyzing a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-fish model, and finds support for the hypothesis that EH enlarges the parameter domain for stable solutions, which may promote coexistence. This study shows how top-down dynamics may influence both biomass and production ratios along the food chain, altering the trophic structure and transfer efficiency to higher trophic levels. The lower-trophic transfer efficiency (from P to Z) (TEPZ) decreases (increases) with increasing EH in the presence (absence) of fish while higher-trophic transfer efficiency from Z to F (TEZF) increases with the level of heterogeneity. These results suggest that previously under-appreciated micro-scale heterogeneity may explain how the low mean-field biomass of zooplankton often observed in oligotrophic waters is able to support the growth of larval fish.","[Priyadarshi, Anupam; Chandra, Ram] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Math, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Smith, S.

For example, zooplankton prey on the infectious stage of the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a pathogen responsible for amphibian population declines and extinctions worldwide. Predation on parasites is predicted to influence community structure and function, and affect disease risk, but relatively few studies have explored its consequences empirically. We investigated interactions among Rana cascadae tadpoles, zooplankton, and Bd in a fully factorial experiment in outdoor mesocosms. We measured growth, development, survival, and infection of amphibians and took weekly measurements of the abundance of zooplankton, phytoplankton (suspended algae), and periphyton (attached algae). We hypothesized that zooplankton might have positive indirect effects on tadpoles by consuming Bd zoospores and by consuming phytoplankton, thus reducing the shading of a major tadpole resource, periphyton. We also hypothesized that zooplankton would have negative effects on tadpoles, mediated by competition for algal resources. Mixed-effects models, repeated-measures ANOVAs, and a structural equation model revealed that zooplankton significantly reduced phytoplankton but had no detectable effects on Bd or periphyton. Hence, the indirect positive effects of zooplankton on tadpoles were negligible when compared to the indirect negative effect mediated by competition for phytoplankton. We conclude that examination of host-pathogen dynamics within a community context may be necessary to elucidate complex community dynamics.","[Buck, Julia C.; Blaustein, Andrew R.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Scholz, Katharina I.] Univ Hohenheim, Agr Sci, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Rohr, Jason R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Buck, JC (corresponding author), Sam Houston State Univ, Texas Res Inst Environm Studies, Huntsville, TX 77341 USA.",julia.buck@gmail.com,"Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021","Buck, Julia/0000-0003-3202-7665",National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0802268]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship; Oregon State University Zoology Research Fund; Society of Wetland Scientists; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R01TW010286] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We thank M.

Ants frequently become established in new areas after being transported by humans across traditional biological or geographical barriers, and a prime example of such establishment is the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta). Introduced to North America in the 1930s, red imported fire ants are now firmly established throughout the southeastern United States. Although these invasive predators can dramatically impact native arthropods, their effect on vertebrates through resource competition is essentially unknown. Using a paired experimental design, we compared patterns of foraging and rates of provisioning for breeding eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) in unmanipulated (control) territories to those in adjacent (treated) territories where fire ants were experimentally reduced. Bluebirds inhabiting treated territories foraged nearer their nests and provisioned offspring more frequently than bluebirds inhabiting control territories with unmanipulated fire ant levels. Additionally, nestlings from treated territories were in better condition than those from control territories, though these differences were largely confined to early development. The elimination of significant differences in body condition toward the end of the nestling period suggests that bluebird parents in control territories were able to make up the food deficit caused by fire ants, potentially by working harder to adequately provision their offspring. The relationship between fire ant abundance and bluebird behavior hints at the complexity of ecological communities and suggests negative effects of invasive species are not limited to taxa with which they have direct contact.","[Ligon, Russell A.; Hill, Geoffrey E.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Siefferman, Lynn] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA","Ligon, RA (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",russell.ligon@gmail.com,"Ligon, Russell/M-1233-2013; Hill, Geoffrey E./R-7354-2019","Ligon, Russell/0000-0002-0195-8275; Hill, Geoffrey E./0000-0001-8864-6495; Siefferman, Lynn/0000-0002-9600-2902",National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI049724]; Birmingham Audubon Society; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI049724] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We thank E.

Underground copulations might be associated with 2 nonexclusive benefits: reducing probability of predation during copulation and reducing interference by conspecific males. We tested whether either of these benefits was involved in determining if the copulation site was underground or aboveground. In 2006 and 2007, we obtained detailed information on the copulatory behavior and social interactions of free-ranging individuals in southwestern Alberta, Canada. During the 3-week annual breeding period, we also recorded the activity of predators of Columbian ground squirrels such as ravens, foxes, and hawks. Squirrels that lived on the periphery of the population were more susceptible to predation than squirrels in the center. Despite this risk, aboveground copulations usually occurred on peripheral territories. In addition, aboveground copulations were not further removed in time from predator attacks or sightings than underground copulations. Copulations that occurred aboveground were sometimes disrupted by previous mates of the estrous female. Probability that copulation would occur aboveground increased when the density of reproductive males around an estrous female was low. Our results suggest that although underground copulations protect individuals from predation, male-male competition for females and interference with copulations have been more important than predation in determining copulatory sites for Columbian ground squirrels in our study population.","[Manno, Theodore G.; Davidson, Jocelyn] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [DeBarbieri, Liliana M.] Auburn Univ, Auburn Autism Ctr, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [DeBarbieri, Liliana M.] Auburn Univ, Dept Educ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Manno, TG (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",mannotg@auburn.edu,,,United States National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0089473]; Auburn University Graduate School,"K.S.

The Australian redclaw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus is invasive in southern African freshwater systems including the Zambezi River Basin. Surveys conducted across the Zambezi Basin (Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Zambia) between 2017 and 2019 showed that C. quadricarinatus is broadly distributed across the Upper and Middle Zambezi and is rapidly spreading through natural and human-mediated means across several ecoregions. The probability of capture (P-capture), catch per unit effort (CPUE) and population characteristics of C. quadricarinatus from the recent Barotse floodplain invasion were compared with older invasions from Lake Kariba and Kafue River. The P-capture and CPUE of C. quadricarinatus in the recently invaded region of the Barotse floodplain were similar to those of the older invasions. Mass and carapace length of C. quadricarinatus from the Barotse floodplain were significantly lower than those of C. quadricarinatus from the older invasions. Sex ratios differed significantly between the three invasive populations. The Barotse floodplain population had a disproportionate investment in females (65.3%) and intersex individuals (8.4%). No crayfish were detected in the Zambezian Headwaters or the Okavango Floodplains ecoregions, but current spread rates are 49 km yr(-1) downstream and 12 km yr(-1) upstream. Investment in population management and the prevention of spread will have high conservation value across the invaded regions in order to restrict crayfish ecological impacts via direct predation and competition. In areas where crayfish are in high abundance, existing fisheries are affected through damage to nets, leading to increased net abandonment and ghost gear pollution in invaded regions. The emphasis should be on developing cohesive transboundary biosecurity policies in southern Africa to limit further spread that will threaten the integrity of freshwater ecosystems. However, long-term monitoring is needed to gauge invasion risk to sensitive areas such as the Okavango Floodplains ecoregion and determine field-based ecological impacts.","[Madzivanzira, Takudzwa C.; Rennie, Craig L.; Richardson, Naomi; Weyl, Olaf L.

The processes at the individual level were simulated following the dynamic energy budget theory, whereas initial egg mortality, background mortality, food competition, and predation (including cannibalism) were additional population processes. Model properties were studied through the analysis of theoretical scenarios and by simulation of different mortality parameter combinations in a realistic setup, imposing environmental measurements. Realistic criteria were applied to narrow down the possible combination of parameter values. Field observations obtained in the long-term and multistation monitoring program were compared with the model scenarios. The realistically selected modeling scenarios were able to reproduce reasonably the timing of some peaks in the individual abundances in the mussel bed and its size distribution but the number of individuals was not well predicted. The results suggest that the mortality in the early life stages (egg and larvae) plays an important role in population dynamics, either by initial egg mortality, larvae dispersion, settlement failure or shrimp predation. Future steps include the coupling of the population model with a hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model to improve the simulation of egg/larvae dispersion, settlement probability, food transport and also to simulate the feedback of the organisms' activity on the water column properties, which will result in an improvement of the food quantity and quality characterization.

However, this view was challenged almost two decades ago on the basis of laboratory and field studies showing that when copepods, the principal predators of diatoms, feed on certain diatom diets, they produce abnormal eggs that either fail to develop to hatching or hatch into malformed (i.e. teratogenic) nauplii that die soon afterwards. Over the years, many explanations have been advanced to explain the causes for reproductive failure in copepods and other marine and freshwater invertebrates including diatom toxicity, or nutritional deficiency and poor assimilation of essential compounds in the animal gut. Here we review the literature concerning the first possibility, that diatoms produce cytotoxic compounds responsible for growth inhibition and teratogenic activity, potentially sabotaging future generations of grazers by inducing poor recruitment. The cytotoxic compounds responsible for these effects are short chain polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs) and other oxygenated fatty acid degradation products such as hydroxides, oxo-acids, and epoxyalcohols (collectively termed oxylipins) that are cleaved from fatty acid precursors by enzymes activated within seconds after crushing of cells. Such toxins are suggested to have multiple simultaneous functions in that they not only deter herbivore feeding but some also act as allelopathic agents against other phytoplankton cells, thereby affecting the growth of competitors, and also signalling population-level cell death and termination of blooms, with possible consequences for food web structure and community composition. Some oxylipins also play a role in driving marine bacterial community diversity, with neutral, positive or negative interactions depending on the species, thereby shaping the structure of bacterial communities during diatom blooms. Several reviews have already been published on diatom-grazer interactions so this paper does not attempt to provide a comprehensive overview, but rather to consider some of the more recent findings in this field. We also consider the role of diatom oxylipins in mediating physiological and ecological processes in the plankton and the multiple simultaneous functions of these secondary metabolites.","[Ianora, Adrianna; Miralto, Antonio] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Funct & Evolutionary Ecol Lab, I-80121 Naples, Italy","Ianora, A (corresponding author), Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Funct & Evolutionary Ecol Lab, I-80121 Naples, Italy.",ianora@szn.it,"Ianora, Adrianna/O-3408-2019",,European CommunitiesEuropean Commission [GOCE-CT-2003-505446],"We thank Giovanna Romano for helpful discussion and review of the chemical aspects of the paper and Flora Palumbo for computer graphics and illustrations.

We compare the test designs and quantify the relative sensitivity and statistical power (1 - beta greater than or equal to 0.8). The survey compares 30-L indoor microcosm to 12,000-L outdoor microcosm experiments, with 225-mL single species laboratory tests as reference. By this we elucidate the extrapolation of ecological effects in space and complexity. Generally, zooplankton had lower tolerance toward PFOS than toward PFOA. With increasing concentrations the zooplankton community became simplified toward more robust rotifer species, which, as an indirect effect, increased their abundance due to a shift in competition and predation. The statistical power of the designs exhibits inverse proportionality between complexity and realism, indoor microcosm > outdoor microcosm. Surprisingly, the 30-L study had a lower LOEC value for Daphnia magna than the laboratory chronic test, indicating that D. magna and D. pulicaria were not the most sensitive species and that laboratory tests are not always conservative relative to microcosm experiments. Food scarcity due to phytotoxicity was not the reason for the difference. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Bird species that nest in the open often cover their eggs to decrease the risk of predators detecting the clutches. However, in cavity nesters, the potential functions of egg covering have not been explored despite some bird species that nest in cavities also covering their eggs as open nesters do. We analysed whether egg covering is an antipredatory behaviour in the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus). We simulated an increase in the perceived risk of predation at experimental nests by adding predator scent inside the nest boxes during the egg-laying period, whilst adding lemon essence or water to control nest boxes. Birds exposed to predator chemical cues in the nest of experimental pairs more frequently covered their eggs than birds exposed to an odorous control. These results suggest that egg covering may have evolved as an antipredatory behaviour also in cavity nesters to reduce the risk of egg predation and thus increase reproductive success in birds.","[Saavedra, Irene; Amo, Luisa] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolutiva, C Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Saavedra, I (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolutiva, C Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",irene.saavedra.garces@gmail.com,"Saavedra, Irene/AAA-4640-2021; Amo, Luisa/K-5960-2014","Amo, Luisa/0000-0003-4621-3493; Saavedra, Irene/0000-0002-7761-6562",Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2014-58890-P],"Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Grant/Award Number: CGL2014-58890-P",,56,3,3,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,NOV,2019,125,11,,,,,785,790,,10.1111/eth.12932,,AUG 2019,6,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,JF3LC,WOS:000479958300001,,,,,2021-09-27,

Although these issues have received increased attention in recent years, empirical measurements of the scales of ecologically important variables are still rare. Here, we measure the spatial and temporal scales of variability of 15; ecologically relevant physical and biological processes in the wave-swept intertidal zone at Mussel Point, near Hopkins Marine Station in California. We analyze temporal variability in wave height. ocean temperature, upwelling intensity, solar irradiance, and body temperature for periods ranging from ten minutes to fifty years. In addition, we measure spatial variation in shoreline topography, wave force, wave-induced disturbance, body temperature, species diversity, recruitment, primary productivity, and the abundances of grazers, predators, and the competitive dominant occupier of space. Each of these spatial variables is measured along three horizontal transects in the upper intertidal zone: a short transect (44 in long with sampling locations spaced at similar to0.5-m intervals), a medium transect (175 in long with sampling locations spaced at similar to1.7-m intervals), and a long transect (334 in long with sampling locations spaced at similar to3.4-m intervals). Six different methods are used to quantify the scale of each variable. Distinct scales are evident in all but one of our temporal variables, demonstrating that our methods for quantifying scale can work effectively with relatively simple, periodic phenomena. However, our spatial results reveal basic problems that arise when attempting to measure the scale of variability for more complex phenomena. For a given variable and length of transect, different methods of calculating scale seldom agree, and in some cases estimates differ by more than an order of magnitude. For a given variable and method of calculating, spatial scale, measurements are sensitive to the length of a transect; the longer the transect. the larger the estimate of scale. We propose that the I/f noise nature of the data can explain both the variability among methods for calculating scale and the length dependence of spatial scales of variation, and that the I/f noise character of the data may be driven by the fractal geometry of shoreline topography. We conclude that it may not be possible to define a meaningful spatial scale of variation in this system. As an alternative to the boiled-down concept of scale, we suggest that it is more appropriate to examine explicitly the pattern in which variability changes with the extent of measurement (e.g., the spectrum). Knowledge of this pattern can provide useful ecological scaling rules even when a well-defined scale (or hierarchy of scales) cannot be discerned.","Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; Univ S Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; Monterey Bay Aquarium, Div Conservat Res, Monterey, CA 93950 USA","Denny, MW (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Oceanview Blvd, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA.",mwdenny@stanford.edu,"Harley, Christopher D.

This study investigated the effects of tourist usage of roads vs. hiking trails on bird communities in gorges of the Flinders Ranges, a popular South Australian tourist destination in the arid-lands. High tourist usage along roads decreased the individual abundance and species richness of birds relative to low usage trails. The decrease in species richness, though less pronounced, also occurred at high-usage sites along trails. Changes in the species response to recreational disturbance/impacts varied depending on the ecology of the species. Bigger, more competitive birds with a generalist diet were overrepresented at high-usage sites along roads and trails. Species using microhabitats in lower vegetation layers were more sensitive. However, structural and floristic complexity of vegetation was a more important factor influencing bird abundance than tourist usage. Sites with a better developed shrub and tree layer sustained higher species abundance and richer communities. Importantly, vegetation qualities moderated the negative effect of high usage on the individual abundance of birds along roads, to the extent that such an effect was absent at sites with the best developed shrub and tree layer. To protect avifauna along recreational tracks in arid-lands gorges, we recommend the closure of some gorges or sections for vehicle or any access. Further, open space particularly for camping needs to be minimized as it creates areas of high tourist usage with modified habitat that provides birds with little buffer from disturbance.

Although biodiversity often shows a delayed response to land-use change, previous studies have typically focused on a narrow range of current landscape factors and have largely ignored the role of land-use history in shaping plant and animal communities and their functional characteristics. Here, we used a unique database of 220,000 land-use records to investigate how 20-y of land-use changes have affected functional diversity across multiple trophic groups (primary producers, mutualists, herbivores, invertebrate predators, and vertebrate predators) in 75 grassland fields with a broad range of land-use histories. The effects of land-use history on multitrophic trait diversity were as strong as other drivers known to impact biodiversity, e.g., grassland management and current landscape composition. The diversity of animal mobility and resource-acquisition traits was lower in landscapes where much of the land had been historically converted from grassland to crop. In contrast, functional biodiversity was higher in landscapes containing old permanent grasslands, most likely because they offer a stable and high-quality habitat refuge for species with low mobility and specialized feeding niches. Our study shows that grassland-to-crop conversion has long-lasting impacts on the functional biodiversity of agricultural ecosystems. Accordingly, land-use legacy effects must be considered in conservation programs aiming to protect agricultural biodiversity. In particular, the retention of permanent grassland sanctuaries within intensive landscapes may offset ecological debts.","[Le Provost, Gaetane; Badenhausser, Isabelle; Henckel, Laura; Bretagnolle, Vincent; Roncoroni, Marilyn] Univ La Rochelle, CNRS, UMR 7372, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Le Provost, Gaetane; Badenhausser, Isabelle; Henckel, Laura; Roncoroni, Marilyn] Univ La Rochelle, Inst Natl Rech Agr Alimentat & Environm, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, Unite Contrat 1339, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Le Provost, Gaetane; Badenhausser, Isabelle; Henckel, Laura; Bretagnolle, Vincent; Roncoroni, Marilyn] Ctr Etud Biol Chize, Long Term Socioecol Res Zone Atelier Plaine & Val, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Le Provost, Gaetane; Manning, Peter] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr SBIK F, Senckenberg Soc Nat Res, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Badenhausser, Isabelle] Inst Natl Rech Agr Alimentat & Environm, Unite Rech Pluridisciplinaire Prairies Plantes Fo, F-86600 Lusignan, France; [Le Bagousse-Pinguet, Yoann] Avignon Univ, Aix Marseille Univ, Inst Mediterraneen Biodiversite & Ecol Marine Con, CNRS,Inst Rech Dev, F-13545 Aix En Provence 04, France; [Clough, Yann] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Henckel, Laura] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Swedish Species Informat Ctr ArtDatabanken, Uppsala, Sweden; [Violle, Cyrille] Univ Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier,Ctr Ecol Fonctionelle & Evolut, CNRS,Inst Rech Dev, Ecole Prat Hautes Etudes,UMR 517, F-34293 Montpellier, France; [Gross, Nicolas] Univ Clermont Auvergne, Inst Natl Rech Agr Alimentat & Environm, VetAgro Sup, Unite Mixte Rech Ecosyst Prairial, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France","Le Provost, G (corresponding author), Univ La Rochelle, CNRS, UMR 7372, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France.; Le Provost, G (corresponding author), Univ La Rochelle, Inst Natl Rech Agr Alimentat & Environm, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, Unite Contrat 1339, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France.; Le Provost, G (corresponding author), Ctr Etud Biol Chize, Long Term Socioecol Res Zone Atelier Plaine & Val, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France.; Le Provost, G (corresponding author), Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr SBIK F, Senckenberg Soc Nat Res, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",gaetaneleprovost@free.fr,"Manning, Peter/I-6523-2012; Clough, Yann/B-9739-2014; Gross, Nicolas/I-2368-2016","Manning, Peter/0000-0002-7940-2023; Badenhausser, Isabelle/0000-0002-6919-8647; HENCKEL, Laura/0000-0002-1944-319X; Clough, Yann/0000-0002-2901-7602; Gross, Nicolas/0000-0001-9730-3240; Le Provost, Gaetane/0000-0002-1643-6023","French government Initiatives d'Excellence-Initiatives Science/Innovation/Territoires/Economie (IDEX-ISITE) initiative [16-IDEX-0001 (CAP 20-25)]; FarmLand research programme, an European Research Area Net (ERA-Net) BiodivERsA project - French Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-EBID-0004]; Enhancing biodiversity-based ecosystem services to crops through optimized densities of green infrastructure in agricultural landscapes (ECODEAL) research programme, 2013-2014 BiodivERsA/Agriculture, Food Security AMP; Climate Change (FACCE-JPI); Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR)European Commission; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und ForschungFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); Swedish Research Council for Environment (FORMAS)Swedish Research Council Formas [2014-1783]; Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen ForschungAustrian Science Fund (FWF); Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); Projekttrager im Deutschen Zentrum fur Luft-und Raumfahrt (PT-DLR); region Poitou-Charentes-department Deux-Sevres PhD grant; AgreenSkills+ fellowship programme from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [FP7-609398]; European Research Council (BIODESERT); Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions Individual Fellowship (MSCA-IF) within the European Program Horizon 2020 (Linking plant functional diversity to ecosystem multifunctionality in arid systems worldwide [DRYFUN] Project) [656035]; European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant Project ecophysiological and biophysical constraints on domestication in crop plantsEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-StG-2014-639706-CONSTRAINTS]","We thank Franck Coudray, Helene Deraison, Yoann Erreca, Thierry Fanjas-Mercere, Jean-Luc Gautier, Louis Gross, Nadine Guillon, Florian Mezerette, Sophie Pillaud, Alexis Saintilan, and Edoardo Tedesco for field assistance.

Cambridge, 1902 and the sit-and-wait Mexican red-rump tarantula (Brachypelma vagans Ausserer, 1875), we studied the relationship between predatory behaviour and antipredatory behaviour at different life stages. In the laboratory, encounters were organized between one wolf spider (small, medium-sized, or large) and one tarantula (spiderling, small, medium-sized, or large). Attack latencies and behaviours were recorded. The results showed that wolf spiders attacked and successfully captured younger tarantulas, while they avoided or retreated from older ones. Tarantulas preferentially attacked and captured older wolf spiders. On other hand, younger wolf spiders were more cautious than older ones, which waited until for the tarantulas to attack before retreating. Younger tarantulas were also more cautious than adults, which never retreated from attack and increased their success in attacks with age. Finally, we discuss the relationship between the predatory strategies of both spiders with their perception abilities and life history.","[Dor, A.; Henaut, Y.] Colegio Frontera Sur, Chetmal 77014, Quintana Roo, Mexico","Dor, A (corresponding author), Colegio Frontera Sur, Ave Centenario Km 5-5, Chetmal 77014, Quintana Roo, Mexico.",ariane.dor@gmail.com,"Dor, Ariane/A-7975-2013; Dor, Ariane/AAQ-7554-2020","Dor, Ariane/0000-0002-3483-9547; Henaut, Yann/0000-0002-8805-1739",Mexican Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [H-52113],"This work was only possible with the technical help of D.

ISRAELENSIS; FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; PREDATION; COMPETITION; CULICIDAE; DIPTERA; FIELD; FOOD; POPULATIONS; SENSITIVITY,"Newly established ponds, which are highly dynamic systems with changing levels of biological interactions among species, are common larval mosquito habitats. We investigated the impact of crustacean abundance and taxa diversity on mosquito oviposition and larval development. The effects of the biological larvicide Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) on mosquito larvae were monitored according to fluctuations in crustacean communities. Populations of the mosquito Culex pipiens colonized artificial ponds that contained crustacean communities at different time points of colonization by crustaceans: 1) 'no colonization' (no crustaceans), 2) 'simultaneous colonization' by crustaceans and mosquitoes, and 3) 'head-start colonization' by crustaceans (preceding colonization by mosquitoes). All types of ponds were treated with three concentrations of Bti (10, 100, or 1,000 mu g/liter). Colonization of all ponds by Cx. pipiens (in terms of oviposition, larval abundance, and larval development) decreased significantly with increasing diversity of crustacean taxa. The total abundance of crustaceans had a minor effect on colonization by Cx. pipiens. The presence of crustaceans increased the sensitivity of Cx. pipiens larvae to Bti treatment by a factor of 10 and delayed the time of recolonization.

While wing formation in response to these individual threats is well documented, few investigations have evaluated whether combined threats lead to additive or non-additive outcomes. We tested the interactive effects of predation risk and plant quality on population growth and wing induction in the potato aphid, Macrosiphum euphorbiae. Plant quality was varied using phytohormonal manipulations of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) to elevate or suppress the jasmonate and salicylate defense pathways. Predation risk was altered by exposing aphids to lethal or risk (unable to feed) individuals of the convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens. Phytohormonal treatments resulted in > 4-fold variation in aphid population growth and thus strongly affected plant quality; however, the percentage of winged individuals was no different across plant types. Predators similarly reduced aphid abundance, but also elicited a similar to 3-fold increase in wing formation, an effect that was similar in magnitude when comparing lethal with risk predators. The overall impact of plants and predators on aphids was largely additive, an outcome that was unexpected given the likelihood for interactions between these two factors and our prior results with other herbivores in this system. We discuss this discrepancy in the context of phenotypic plasticity, non-lethal predator effects, and the ecological challenges faced by wing dimorphic insects.","[Kaplan, Ian] Purdue Univ, Dept Entomol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Thaler, Jennifer S.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol & Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA","Kaplan, I (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Entomol, 901 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",ikaplan@purdue.edu,,,"National Research Initiative of the USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2006-35302-17431]","We thank Elena Olsen for assistance with greenhouse and field experiments, Cesar Rodriguez-Saona for providing our source of potato aphids, and Monica Kersch-Becker for helpful comments on improving the manuscript.

In populations where cannibalism is common, this size variation can influence rates of mortality and growth and affect population regulation. Size variation can be caused by a variety of mechanisms. One of these is due to size-specific responses to the threat of predation by potentially cannibalistic conspecifics. We investigated the role of antipredator behavior in size structure development within single-aged cohorts of Arizona tiger salamander larvae. In a laboratory experiment, we show that size variation increases over time within groups of salamanders, even if they are fed in isolation. We also show that increasing the size of neighbors decreases the feeding rate of small salamander larvae. However, increasing density of neighbors did not have a significant effect on feeding rate. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that size variation among tiger salamander larvae is, in part, a result of size-specific responses to predation risk. We discuss the potential for feedback between size structure development, predation risk, and rates of cannibalism.","Univ Kentucky, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Behav, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; Arizona State Univ, Dept Biol, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Ziemba, RE (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Behav, 101 Morgan Bldg, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",reziem2@pop.uky.edu,,,,,,34,21,22,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2000,124,2,,,,,225,231,,10.1007/s004420050010,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,345PJ,WOS:000088824100010,28308182,,,,2021-09-27,

Sonic transmitters were surgically implanted into a total of 123 age-1 Spot in two North Carolina estuarine creeks during spring 2009 and 2010, and the fish were monitored by using a stationary acoustic receiver array and manual tracking. Fates of telemetered Spot were inferred based on telemetry information from estimated locations and swimming speeds. Potential competitors of age-1 Spot were assessed through simultaneous otter trawl sampling, while potential predators of Spot were collected using gill nets and trammel nets. The number of inferred natural mortalities was zero in 2009 (based on 29 telemetered Spot at risk) and four in 2010 (based on 52 fish at risk), with fish being at risk for up to about 70 d each year. Catches of potential competitors or predators did not differ between years, and age-1 Spot were not found in analyzed stomach contents of potential predators. Our estimated 30-d M of 0.03 (95% credible interval = 0.010.07) was lower than that predicted from weight-based (M = 0.07) and life-history-based (M = 0.060.36) estimates. Our field-based estimate of M for age-1 Spot in this estuarine system can assist in the assessment and management of Spot by allowing a direct comparison with M-values predicted from fish size or life history characteristics. The field telemetry and statistical analysis techniques developed here provide guidance for future telemetry studies of relatively small fish in open, dynamic habitat systems, as they highlight strengths and weaknesses of using a telemetry approach to estimate M.

The Exploitation Ecosystem Hypothesis (EEH) posited that as aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) increases, the additional biomass should support higher trophic levels. We developed an extension of EEH to include the impacts of increases in ANPP on belowground consumers in a similar manner as aboveground, but indirectly through changes in the allocation of photosynthate to roots. We tested our predictions for plants aboveground and for phytophagous nematodes and their predators belowground in two common arctic tundra plant communities subjected to 11 years of increased soil nutrient availability and/or exclusion of mammalian herbivores. The less productive dry heath (DH) community met the predictions of EEH aboveground, with the greatest ANPP and plant biomass in the fertilized plots protected from herbivory. A palatable grass increased in fertilized plots while dwarf evergreen shrubs and lichens declined. Belowground, phytophagous nematodes also responded as predicted, achieving greater biomass in the higher ANPP plots, whereas predator biomass tended to be lower in those same plots (although not significantly). In the higher productivity moist acidic tussock (MAT) community, aboveground responses were quite different. Herbivores stimulated ANPP and biomass in both ambient and enriched soil nutrient plots; maximum ANPP occurred in fertilized plots exposed to herbivory. Fertilized plots became dominated by dwarf birch (a deciduous shrub) and cloudberry (a perennial forb); under ambient conditions these two species coexist with sedges, evergreen dwarf shrubs, and Sphagnum mosses. Phytophagous nematodes did not respond significantly to changes in ANPP, although predator biomass was greatest in control plots. The contrasting results of these two arctic tundra plant communities suggest that the predictions of EEH may hold for very low ANPP communities, but that other factors, including competition and shifts in vegetation composition toward less palatable species, may confound predicted responses to changes in productivity in higher ANPP communities such as the MAT studied here.","[Gough, Laura; Johnson, David R.] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Moore, John C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Moore, John C.; Simpson, Rodney T.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Shaver, Gauis R.] Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Gough, L (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",gough@uta.edu,"Moore, John/E-9802-2011",,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OPP-0425827, OPP-0425606, DEB-0423385]","We gratefully thank Jim Laundre for long-term maintenance of these experiments and the many field and lab assistants involved in this project, including: Amie Treuer, Carol Moulton, Charla Jordan, Jef Knight, Brian Moon, Karl Wyant, and Greg Selby.

Mulching with grass-clippings consistently resulted in increased yield and reduced damage by root maggots, as measured by wilting symptoms and root damage. During one of these years, the effects of mulching with grass-clippings on root fly population dynamics was also studied. Mulching did not reduce egg-laying but resulted in increased egg-predation. The number of D. floralis pupae per plant was not reduced by mulching, probably because of higher larval mortality owing to competition in unmulched plots. Mulching decreased the rate of parasitization by Aleochara bilineata (Staphylinidae), resulting in a higher number of healthy pupae per plant in grass-mulched plots, and these healthy pupae were heavier.

Selective exclusions of vertebrate predators or putative small mammal competitors, or both, have yielded relatively small or mostly transitory effects, or both, on small mammal population dynamics and plant community composition. During the study period 5 El Nino-high rainfall episodes have occurred lasting 1-3 years. Resident or core small mammals such as Abrothrix olivaceus, Phyllotis darwini, and Octodon degus experience dramatic fluctuations during and following rainfall pulses. Temporary resident or opportunistic species such as Oligoryzomys longicaudatus and A. longipilis disappear from the thorn scrub for varying periods of time. All species persist in more mesic nearby habitats near dry stream courses (aguadas). Since a 3-year high rainfall event in 2000-2002 mean annual rainfall has increased in this region, mainly due to a lack of prolonged droughts. Under these conditions, and building on a qualitative model proposed by Noy-Meir, long-lived species might become more abundant. Changes in the small mammal assemblage are consistent with these predictions; O. degus, a caviomorph rodent with a long life span, now comprises a more constant proportion of the small mammal biomass in the thorn scrub, and we have documented reduced variation in species diversity. Increased rainfall, a predicted consequence of global climate change in this region, might be leading to changes in small mammal assemblage structure and composition and ultimately will result in a more stable, less oscillatory assemblage in the thorn scrub. Additionally, invasive groups such as introduced lagomorphs and ephemeral plants might become more abundant in this community. The long-term consequences of changes in rainfall patterns due to El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSOs), with important teleconnections to global-scale phenomena, will lead to diverse changes at the community level here.","[Meserve, Peter L.] No Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Kelt, Douglas A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Previtali, M.

Benthivorous perch (Perca fluviatilis) were stocked over a range of natural densities (no fish, low, and high densities) into enclosures with or without dense submerged vegetation. The biomass of macroinvertebrate prey decreased over time in the presence of perch and was always higher in enclosures with vegetation present than in enclosures lacking vegetation. The increase in mass of perch was positively related to the abundance of macroinvertebrate prey and negatively related to perch density and the density of vegetation. In the treatments lacking vegetation, the proportion of zooplankton in the diet of perch increased, and the growth rate of perch decreased over time. In the vegetation treatments, the proportion of zooplankton in the diet was low throughout the experiment and the growth rate of perch was constant over time. As a consequence, initial increase in mass was considerably higher in the treatments lacking vegetation than in the vegetation treatments, whereas no such pattern was observed in the second half of the experiment. In the absence of vegetation, perch are apparently able to forage efficiently, but this may reduce the availability of macroinvertebrate prey to the extent that perch are forced to include less profitable zooplankton prey into their diet. In vegetated habitats, the foraging efficiency of perch is reduced, which possibly prevents over-exploitation of macroinvertebrate prey and consequently may allow for a moderate, but relatively constant, consumption of macroinvertebrates by perch. The density-dependence of growth rates in both vegetated and unvegetated habitats can only partly be explained by resource competition, which suggests the presence of an additional mechanism of density-dependence. In natural lake communities, efficient predation from benthivorous fish should keep the biomass of macroinvertebrate prey in structurally simple habitats below the high levels initially present in my experiment. In these communities, submerged vegetation may be an equally profitable habitat for juvenile perch as are open areas. Through its effects on the feeding efficiencies of juvenile perch and other benthivorous fish, submerged vegetation may affect individual growth rates and the size structure of perch populations, which may contribute to explain differences in fish community structure among lakes differing in submerged vegetation cover.",,"DIEHL, S (corresponding author), UMEA UNIV, DEPT ANIM ECOL, S-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN.",,"Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013; Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051",,,,70,86,87,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,1993,67,3,,,,,403,414,,10.2307/3545353,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LN449,WOS:A1993LN44900003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Although populations harbour considerable diversity, most ecological studies still assume they are homogeneous. However, mounting evidence suggests that intraspecific diversity is not only common, but also important for interactions with community members. Here, intraspecific variation in Daphnia dentifera in haemoglobin content is shown to be a marker of hypolimnion use. 2. Hypolimnion use differed substantially within and among D. dentifera populations. Daphnia dentifera with haemoglobin resided primarily in the hypolimnion, while D. dentifera lacking haemoglobin migrated vertically. These 'deep' and 'migratory' D. dentifera had different seasonal phenologies and dynamics. 3. Deep and migratory D. dentifera had qualitatively different relationships with an important competitor, Daphnia pulicaria. Deep D. dentifera density was negatively correlated with D. pulicaria density, whereas migratory density was not correlated with D. pulicaria density. 4. Given that D. pulicaria tends to reside in the hypolimnion, this negative correlation probably reflects competition between D. pulicaria and the deep D. dentifera.

Such pronounced morphological changes can arise from divergent selection via differing resource availability, competition or predation pressure. Past studies have not been able to demonstrate a reversal of these morphological changes when populations are removed from their island situation. This study examines the body size response of populations of the Barrow Island dwarf' subspecies of golden bandicoot (Isoodon auratus barrowensis: Ramsay, 1887) following translocation to an island and mainland site within their former range. Skeletal and mass measurements, body condition and fecundity of released animals and their offspring were compared to data from the source population. When comparing bandicoots born at translocation sites to source populations, males were significantly larger in skeletal size and mass, females were also significantly larger and exhibited higher reproductive output (number, frequency and average mass of pouch young). These effects occurred in a gradient according to environmental conditions, where animals were smallest and least productive at the densely populated source site, larger and more productive on a nearby island, and largest and most productive at a mainland site with some nutritional supplementation. These changes in skeletal size, mass and fecundity took place in the first 1-4 generations (18months post-release), suggesting that the response is not explained by natural selection. We posit that the small size of golden bandicoots on Barrow Island (315.8 +/- 4.2g, this study, cf 569.4 +/- 19.3g, mainland) is not a genotypic response to selective pressures, but rather a reversible phenotypic response to more favourable environmental conditions. A reduction in competitive pressures appeared to allow bandicoots to grow to a larger size and mass, and allow greater reproductive output. Ecological processes relating to resource limitation appear to drive island dwarfism' in I.auratus, and may apply to other insular species with morphological differentiation.","[Dunlop, Judy; Morris, Keith] Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Locked Bag 104,Bentley Delivery Ctr, Perth, WA, Australia","Dunlop, J (corresponding author), Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Locked Bag 104,Bentley Delivery Ctr, Perth, WA, Australia.",judy.dunlop@dbca.wa.gov.au,,,Chevron Australia,"We thank countless field volunteers who assisted during the 11 years of trapping for this project.

In three mountain lakes which differed in the density of young-of-the-year (YOY) arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), we studied the growth, diets and habitat use of YOY char in relation to resource levels. With two model approaches, we further examined the extent to which YOY and 1-yr old char were resource limited and, if so, whether resource limitation was associated with habitat use and small char densities. Benthic prey dominated the diet of YOY char and YOY char habitat use was restricted to the near-shore habitat in all lakes. In all lakes were chironomid densities higher in the near-shore habitat than in the offshore benthic habitat whereas zooplankton densities were higher in the pelagic than in the near-shore habitat. Growth of YOY char in all lakes was close to predicted maximum growth despite large variation in YOY densities between lakes. Model results suggested that density dependent resource limitation in YOY char is unlikely to occur despite restricted near-shore habitat use. In contrast, strong density dependent resource limitation was predicted in 1-yr old char with a restricted habitat use to the near-shore habitat. Correspondingly, field data suggested that the habitat use of 1-yr old char was density dependent as the use of the offshore habitat increased earlier in time and to a larger extent at high densities. As small individuals are vulnerable to predation but constrained by their low food processing capacity relative to their encounter capacity, we suggest that resource limitation in small individuals should be less pronounced and habitat use should mainly depend on predation risk. A trade-off in habitat use between foraging gain and predation risk is therefore expected to be more likely for individuals, large enough to be resource limited but still small enough to be vulnerable to predation.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquaculture, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands","Bystrom, P (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquaculture, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden.",par.bystrom@vabr.slu.se,"Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012; De Roos, Andre M./A-1590-2008","De Roos, Andre M./0000-0002-6944-2048",,,,51,45,47,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2004,104,1,,,,,109,121,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12759.x,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,762FY,WOS:000187962200012,,,,,2021-09-27,

Ecological interactions that involve aggressive confrontations between animals are important in shaping the evolution of morphology, behaviour and life history. However, as such confrontations are rarely witnessed, direct quantification of the intensity of these processes in natural populations is notoriously difficult. While the utilization of the frequency of non-lethal injuries is fraught with difficulties, it may provide information concerning different types of interaction, such as predation, intraspecific aggression and interspecific interference competition. 2. In this paper, we report on an exceptionally large difference in toe loss incidence between two populations of Podarcis sicula lizards living on small, neighbouring islands in the Adriatic Sea. We caught 900 lizards and recorded the number and location of missing toes. Subsequently, we investigated five non-mutually exclusive hypotheses concerning differences in bite force capacity, bone strength, predation intensity, average age and intraspecific aggression that may provide proximate explanations for the observed differences in injury frequencies. 3. Bite force differences differed considerably between the populations, but bone strength was found to be stronger in the populations with a higher frequency of natural scars. Predation pressure clearly differed between the populations, but we found higher injury rates under predation relaxation. 4. Our results indicate that density and consequently an increased intraspecific competition is the most likely explanation for the observed high frequencies of injuries. We suggest that the intensity of toe amputation between lizard populations may be a useable indirect indication for the intensity of intraspecific competition. 5. This study shows how a combination of morphological, physiological, behavioural and ecological measurements can be used to test assumptions implicit to alternative explanations of an observed phenomenon. Such tests can reveal how likely each of these explanations is, even if the processes leading to the phenomenon are difficult to observe directly.","[Vervust, Bart; Van Damme, Raoul] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Lab Funct Morphol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Van Dongen, Stefan] Dept Biol, Evolutionary Biol Grp, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Grbac, Irena] Nat Hist Museum Croatia, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia","Vervust, B (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Lab Funct Morphol, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",bart.vervust@ua.ac.be,,"Van Damme, Raoul/0000-0002-4585-6940",FWO - FlandersFWO [G.0111.06],"This study is part of larger projects supported by the FWO - Flanders (project no.

In this study we examined whether the natural level of Common Cuckoo (hereafter Cuckoo) PAB increases the risk of artificial nest predation (n = 48) by using three types of experimental playback of parent-present begging (PPB) which differ in the presence or absence of additional PPB, PAB or periods of silence. Contrary to our predictions, we did not find a significant difference in daily survival rates between PPB + PAB vs. PPB + PPB nests or between PPB + PAB vs. PPB + silence nests, indicating that the natural level of Cuckoo PAB did not influence nest vulnerability to predation. Moreover, we did not find a significant difference between nests with any of the types of playback and completely silent control nests, suggesting that not only PAB, but also begging behaviour itself, does not present an important predation cost for nestlings, at least not in cases when nestlings beg at the natural level used in our experiment. As we filmed all experimental nests during their exposure to predators, we were able to show that eight of 20 filmed nest-predation events were caused by predators that never or rarely predate upon passerine nests. Excluding predation events by these unlikely predators, however, did not change our original results. Nonetheless, we advocate direct identification of nest predators to strengthen the interpretation of future studies on the predation cost of begging.","[Jelinek, Vaclav; Sulc, Michal; Honza, Marcel] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Vvi, Kvetna 8, CS-60365 Brno, Czech Republic; [Weidinger, Karel] Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, 17 Listopadu 50, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic; [Weidinger, Karel] Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Ornithol Lab, 17 Listopadu 50, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic","Jelinek, V (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Vvi, Kvetna 8, CS-60365 Brno, Czech Republic.",vasekjelinek@gmail.com,"Honza, Marcel/A-1123-2011; Sulc, Michal/E-9553-2019; Sulc, Michal/E-3257-2016; Jelinek, Vaclav/G-2463-2011","Sulc, Michal/0000-0002-7866-1795; Sulc, Michal/0000-0002-7866-1795; Jelinek, Vaclav/0000-0002-0997-7358",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [GACR 17-12262S],"We would like to thank Petr Prochazka, Milica Pozgayova, Mirek Capek and Klara Zabkova for their assistance in the field; Klara Zabkova and Marian Polak for their help with preparation of the recordings for analyis and Fig. 1; Tereza Karasova for Cuckoo loudness data; Alfred Trnka for providing Greenfinch and Linnet eggs, and Marek Mihai Abraham for data on the frequency of both types of Cuckoo begging.

However, detection of interactions among sympatric predators can be complicated by fluctuations in the background availability of resources in the environment, which may modify both the numbers of predators and the strengths of their interactions. Here, we first present a conceptual framework that predicts how top-down and bottom-up interactions may regulate sympatric predator populations in environments that experience resource pulses. We then test it using 2 years of remote-camera trapping data to uncover spatial and temporal interactions between a top predator, the dingo Canis dingo, and the mesopredatory European red fox Vulpes vulpes and feral cat Felis catus, during population booms, declines and busts in numbers of their prey in a model desert system. We found that dingoes predictably suppress abundances of the mesopredators and that the effects are strongest during declines and busts in prey numbers. Given that resource pulses are usually driven by large yet infrequent rains, we conclude that top predators like the dingo provide net benefits to prey populations by suppressing mesopredators during prolonged bust periods when prey populations are low and potentially vulnerable.","[Greenville, Aaron C.; Wardle, Glenda M.; Tamayo, Bobby; Dickman, Chris R.] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Desert Ecol Res Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Greenville, Aaron C.; Wardle, Glenda M.; Tamayo, Bobby; Dickman, Chris R.] Terr Ecosyst Res Network, Multiscale Plot Network, Long Term Ecol Res Network, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Greenville, AC (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Desert Ecol Res Grp, Heydon Laurence Bldg A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",aaron.greenville@sydney.edu.au,"Greenville, Aaron/G-9718-2013; Wardle, Glenda M/D-6533-2016; Dickman, Christopher/Q-4662-2019","Greenville, Aaron/0000-0002-0113-4778; Wardle, Glenda M/0000-0003-0189-1899; Dickman, Christopher/0000-0002-1067-3730","Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government; Paddy Pallin Grant, Royal Zoological Society of NSW; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Australian Government's Terrestrial Ecosystems Research NetworkAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science","We thank Bush Heritage Australia and G.

Avian scavengers in African savanna ecosystems are reported to rely exclusively on visual stimuli to locate carcasses. However, carnivores' predation of large mammalian herbivores and subsequent competition for access to the carcass can result in considerable noise, often audible over long distances and for prolonged periods. Vultures and other avian scavengers may therefore detect and respond to these auditory cues, as do the mammalian carnivores alongside which vultures have coevolved, but this has not been investigated to date. Working in the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania, we used diurnal auditory broadcasts to simulate predation and competitive carnivore feeding interactions. Based on the current understanding of avian scavenger ecology, we hypothesized that avian responses to call-in stations would be evoked exclusively by visual, rather than auditory, cues. We therefore predicted that (a) the arrival of avian scavengers at call-in stations should be preceded and facilitated by mammalian carnivores and that (b) the arrival of avian scavengers would be positively correlated with the number of mammalian scavengers present, which would increase detectability. We recorded 482 birds during 122 separate playback events. In 22% of these instances, avian scavengers arrived first, ruling out responses based exclusively on visual observations of mammalian carnivores, thereby contradicting our first prediction. Furthermore, the first avian arrivals at survey sessions were inversely related to the number of hyenas and jackals present, contradicting our second prediction. Since no bait or carcasses were used during the experiments, these responses are indicative of the birds' ability to detect and respond to audio stimuli. Our findings challenge the current consensus of sensory perception and foraging in these species and provide evidence that avian scavengers have the ability to use sound to locate food resources.","[Jackson, Craig R.; Stokke, Bard G.; Bevanger, Kjetil; May, Roel; Fossoy, Frode] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, POB 5685 Torgarden, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway; [Maddox, Thomas] Fauna & Flora Int, Cambridge, England; [Mbise, Franco P.] Univ Dodoma, Dodoma, Tanzania; [Belant, Jerrold L.] SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Durant, Sarah M.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England; [Fyumagwa, Robert] Tanzanian Wildlife Res Inst, Arusha, Tanzania; [Ranke, Peter S.; Roskaft, Eivin] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway","Jackson, CR (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Nat Res, POB 5685 Torgarden, N-7485 Trondheim, Norway.",craig.jackson@nina.no,"Durant, Sarah M/AAB-9659-2019; MBISE, FRANCO/AAT-2739-2021; Jackson, Craig/AAT-9335-2021","Durant, Sarah M/0000-0003-0724-0878; Jackson, Craig/0000-0002-3918-1721; Ranke, Peter S./0000-0003-3757-8626",European UnionEuropean Commission [641918]; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; Natural Environment Research Council UKUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Frankfurt Zoological Society,"We appreciate the constructive comments received from two anonymous reviewers.

This species provides the opportunity to study the signalling value of begging calls in the absence of potentially confounding factors such as nestling competition, previous feeding experiences and predation pressure. We applied a new method using a semi-automatic spectrogram analysis software that measures the acoustic parameters of begging calls. Our analysis revealed that the frequency parameters of begging calls reflect chicks' current body condition, with chicks in poorer condition uttering calls at higher frequencies. Chicks uttering higher pitched calls also received larger meals.

Much of our understanding of what drives sex-biased dispersal stems from work on birds and mammals where dispersal tends to be female and male biased, respectively. Here, we draw on this large body of empirical and theoretical work on vertebrates to investigate what drives breeding dispersal in an ectoparasite, the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis. We manipulated the density, sex, and developmental stage of lice on pairs of juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) hosts and show that the probability of leaving a host is density dependent at the preadult I stage and dependent on the presence of the opposite sex at preadult II and adult stages. Experiments in which louse movement was observed in groups of 25 individually infected hosts supported findings from individual experiments. Lice appeared to account for predation risk as they were 3 times more likely to disperse in the dark, when susceptibility to predation was low, than in the light. Our results support the hypothesis that asymmetry in reproductive investment shapes patterns of sex-biased dispersal and highlight the potential for drivers of dispersal to change with ontogeny. These findings are the first to establish what drives dispersal in the ecologically and economically important salmon louse and highlight the generality of the role mate competition plays in driving sex-biased dispersal across the animal kingdom.","[Connors, B.

Ecological stoichiometry theory postulates the elemental ratios of consumer species to be homeostatic, while primary-producer stoichiometry may vary with ambient nutrient availability. The notion of phytoplankton intracellular storage is far from novel, but remains largely unexplored in modeling studies of population dynamics. We constructed a seasonally-unforced, zero-dimensional, nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus (NPZD) model that considers dynamic phytoplankton phosphorus reserves and quasi-dynamic zooplankton stoichiometry. A generic food quality term is used to express seston biochemical composition, ingestibility, and digestibility. We examined the sensitivity of the planktonic food web patterns to light and nutrient availability, zooplankton mortality, and detritus food quality as well as to phytoplankton intracellular storage and zooplankton stoichiometry. Our results reinforce earlier findings that high quality seston exerts a stabilizing effect on food web dynamics. However, we also found that the combination of low algal and high detritus food quality with high zooplankton mortality yielded limit cycles and multiple steady states, suggesting that the heterogeneity characterizing seston nutritional quality may have more complicated ecological ramifications. Our numerical experiments identify resource competition strategies related to nutrient transport rates and internal nutrient quotas that may be beneficial for phytoplankton to persevere in resource-limiting habitats. We also highlight the importance of the interplay between optimal stoichiometry and the factors controlling homeostatic rigidity in zooplankton. In particular, our predictions show that the predominance of phosphorus-rich and tightly-homeostatic herbivores in nutrient-enriched environments with low seston food quality can potentially result in high phytoplankton abundance, high phytoplankton-to-zooplankton ratios, and acceleration of oscillatory dynamics. Generally, our modeling study emphasizes the impact of both intracellular/somatic storage and food quality on prey-predator interactions, pinpointing an important aspect of food web dynamics usually neglected by the contemporary modeling studies.

We examined the effects of the Eastern Red-Backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus) on leaf litter decomposition rates and invertebrate populations in the mixed oak forests of southwestern Virginia from May 2006 to June 2008. We constructed 12 in situ mesocosms with 0, 1.0, or 2.0 P. cinereus/m(2) (4.0 P. cinereus/m(2) in year 2). We quantified decomposition rates of leaf litter and numbers of invertebrates with litter bags that were removed from mesocosms monthly throughout the experiment. Further, we assessed what taxa of invertebrates were preyed upon by salamanders with gastric lavage. Across our 2-year experiment, we were unable to detect an effect of salamander abundance on rates of leaf litter decomposition, numbers of broad invertebrate taxonomic groupings, or functional guilds of invertebrates. Stomach analysis confirmed that salamanders were euryphagic, but they consumed more herbivores than detritivores or predators. Although we are unclear why these results conflict with earlier work indicating that salamanders can influence invertebrates and leaf litter decomposition, variability of canopy trees or microclimate may have contributed to a lack of control of invertebrate populations or litter decomposition by salamanders in the complex mixed-oak forests of the Appalachian Mountains.","[Homyack, Jessica A.; Haas, Carola A.] Virginia Tech, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Sucre, Eric B.; Fox, Thomas R.] Virginia Tech, Dept Forestry, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Homyack, JA (corresponding author), Weyerhaeuser NR Co, 1785 Weyerhaeuser Rd, Vanceboro, NC 28586 USA.",jessica.homyack@weyerhaeuser.com,"Haas, Carola A./B-5056-2009","Haas, Carola A./0000-0002-5490-6882",U.S. Department of Agriculture National Research InitiativeUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2005-35101-15363]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [SBE-0244916],"This study was funded by a U.S. Department of Agriculture National Research Initiative Grant to C.

Though shifts in prey dominance and predator resource use along environmental gradients are rather common, empirical evidence on the role of indirect prey-prey interactions through shared predation particularly with increasing productivity, is still scarce. In an 8-week lake mesocosm experiment, we manipulated both the addition of inorganic nutrients and the presence of generalist fish predators (crucian carp, Carassius carassius L.), to test for the effects of indirect interactions through shared predation along a productivity gradient. We found that apparent mutualism (indirect positive interaction) between benthic and pelagic prey strongly affected short-term responses of aquatic food webs to increasing productivity in the presence of a generalist fish. Increasing productivity favoured the relative abundance of benthic prey, following trends in natural productive lake systems. This led to a shift in fish selectivity from pelagic to benthic prey driven by changes in fish behaviour, which resulted in apparent mutualism due to the lower and delayed top-down control of pelagic prey at increasing productivity. Our results show empirical evidence that the coupling of multiple production pathways can lead to strong indirect interactions through shared predation, whereby prey dynamics on short time-scales are highly dependent on the foraging behaviour of generalist predators. This mechanism may play an important role in short-term responses of food webs across environmental gradients.","[Chaguaceda, Fernando; Scharnweber, Kristin; Dalman, Erik; Tranvik, Lars J.; Eklov, Peter] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, Limnol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Chaguaceda, Fernando] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, POB 7050, Uppsala 75007, Sweden","Chaguaceda, F (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, Limnol, Uppsala, Sweden.; Chaguaceda, F (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, POB 7050, Uppsala 75007, Sweden.",fernando.chaguaceda@slu.se,"Chaguaceda, Fernando/AAO-2991-2020","Chaguaceda, Fernando/0000-0002-0827-2110; Scharnweber, Kristin/0000-0003-2858-5947; Tranvik, Lars J./0000-0003-3509-8266",Knut and Alice Wallenberg FoundationKnut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation [KAW 2013.0091]; Malmens Foundation [1463000356],"Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, Grant/Award Number: KAW 2013.0091; Malmens Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 1463000356",,60,0,0,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

However, and despite a long-standing competition between ratio and prey-dependent models (and a few alternative intermediate forms) in the literature, most equations currently used to represent such relationships do not meet theoretical criteria for biological consistency. This research proposes a set of universally applicable criteria for all predation equations and shows that the most commonly used predation equations in the literature fail to meet these same criteria. We follow with a proposal for a new predation equation that does meet these criteria, which combines both prey and ratio-dependent concepts while giving reasonable predictions in the cases of both high predator or high prey densities. We show its empirical performance by applying the new equation, along with existing alternatives, to various experimental predation datasets from the literature. Results show that the new equation is not only more mathematically consistent than existing equations, but also performs more consistently empirically across different datasets from various ecological situations. This research is the first to propose a systematic set of criteria to evaluate predation equations and then to offer an equation that meets these criteria and also performs well both theoretically and empirically across datasets from a wide range of predation systems.","[Malard, Julien; Adamowski, Jan; Nassar, Jessica Bou] McGill Univ, Bioresource Engn, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ, Canada; [Anandaraja, Nallusamy] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Tuy, Hector] Univ Rafael Landivar, IARNA, Guatemala City, Guatemala; [Melgar-Quinonez, Hugo] McGill Univ, Margaret A Gilliam Inst Global Food Secur, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ, Canada","Malard, J (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Bioresource Engn, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ, Canada.",julien.malard@mail.mcgill.ca,"Tuy, Hector/G-4131-2012","Bou Nassar, Jessica/0000-0002-2658-3692",NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [RGPIN-2015-05554]; FRQNT (Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Nature et technologies) Bourse de 3e cycle; Bourse du CRDI (Centre de recherches pour le developpement international) aux chercheurs candidats au doctorat [107759-99906075-017]; Bourse d'etudes superieures du Canada Vanier; Supplement pour etudes a l`etranger MichaelSmith (Programme de bourses d`etudes superieures du Canada) scholarship,"This research was supported by an NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada) Discovery Grant (Grant number: RGPIN-2015-05554) held by Dr. Jan Adamowski, as well as an FRQNT (Fonds de recherche du Quebec -Nature et technologies) Bourse de 3e cycle, a Bourse du CRDI (Centre de recherches pour le developpement international) aux chercheurs candidats au doctorat (Award number 107759-99906075-017), a Bourse d'etudes superieures du Canada Vanier and a Supplement pour etudes a l`etranger MichaelSmith (Programme de bourses d`etudes superieures du Canada) scholarship held by Julien Malard.",,41,1,1,3,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Phenotypic plasticity in response to predators typically includes development of physical and behavioral traits, including changes in tail coloration, activity rate, and tail shape and body size. Responding to predators increases the probability of survival, but lowers growth rate. Responses to two common stressors in ephemeral aquatic habitats appear to be in direct opposition to one another. In this study, we examined the individual and interactive effects of hydroperiod and predator density on the life history, morphology, and metamorphosis of wood frog (Rana sylvatica) tadpoles in an outdoor mesocosm study. Tadpoles were exposed to three hydroperiods (constant, intermediate, and short) and three predator densities (zero, four, and eight Anax junius naiads) using a complete block design. The threat of habitat desiccation resulted in increased developmental rate and shorter larval periods. Increased predator densities resulted in increased size at metamorphosis and development of the induced morphology. Although the threat of predation precluded growth and developmental responses to shortened hydroperiod in tadpoles, it did not negate the metamorphic responses to hydroperiod. It appears that, at least at the treatment levels imposed in this experiment, the interaction between these multiple stressors is complex, with the stressors acting both individually and together on different aspects of tadpole ecology.","[Lent, Emily May; Babbitt, Kimberly J.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Lent, Emily May] US Army Publ Hlth Ctr, MCHB PH TEV, Aberdeen Proving Ground Edgewood Area, E-5158,8252 Blackhawk Rd, Edgewood, MD 21010 USA","Lent, EM (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH 03824 USA.; Lent, EM (corresponding author), US Army Publ Hlth Ctr, MCHB PH TEV, Aberdeen Proving Ground Edgewood Area, E-5158,8252 Blackhawk Rd, Edgewood, MD 21010 USA.",emily.m.lent.civ@mail.mil,,,,,,88,5,5,6,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,1573-5125,,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

In addition, soil fauna can act as ecosystem engineers by creating, modifying, and maintaining the habitat for other organisms. Ecologists usually utilize live catches in pitfalls traps as a standard method to study the activity of epigeic fauna in addition to relative abundance. Counts in pitfall traps can be used as estimates of relative activity to compare among experimental treatments. This requires taking independent estimates of abundance (e.g., by sifting soil litter, mark-recapture), which can then be used as covariates in linear models to compare the levels of fauna activity (trap catches) among treatments. However, many studies show that the use of pitfall traps is not the most adequate method to estimate soil fauna relative abundances, and these concerns may be extensible to estimating activity. Here, we present two new types of traps devised to study activity in litter fauna, and which we call cul-de-sac and basket traps, respectively. We experimentally show that, at least for litter dwellers, these new traps are more appropriate to estimate fauna activity than pitfall traps because: (1) pitfall traps contain 3.5x more moisture than the surrounding environment, potentially attracting animals towards them when environmental conditions are relatively dry; (2) cul-de-sac and basket traps catch ca. 4x more of both meso- and macrofauna than pitfall traps, suggesting that pitfall traps are underestimating activity; and (3) pitfall traps show a bias towards collecting 1.5x higher amounts of predators, which suggests that predation rates are higher within pitfall traps. We end with a protocol and recommendations for how to use these new traps in ecological experiments and surveys aiming at estimating soil arthropod activity.","[Ruiz-Lupion, Dolores; Melguizo-Ruiz, Nereida; Moya-Larano, Jordi] CSIC, EEZA, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Carretera Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Pascual, Jordi] Generalitat Catalunya, Cos Agents Rurals, Amposta 43870, Spain; [Melguizo-Ruiz, Nereida] CIBIO, InBio Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, P-7000651 Evora, Portugal; [Melguizo-Ruiz, Nereida] Oviedo Univ, Res Unit Biodivers, UO,PA, CSIC, Mieres 33600, Spain; [Verdeny-Vilalta, Oriol] Ynsect, Rue Pierre Fontain 1, F-91000 Evry, France","Ruiz-Lupion, D (corresponding author), CSIC, EEZA, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Carretera Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain.",loli.ruiz@eeza.csic.es; jpascualsala@gmail.com; nereidamelguizoruiz@gmail.com; oriolverdeny@gmail.com; jordi@eeza.csic.es,"Melguizo-Ruiz, Nereida/AAI-2608-2019; Ruiz-Lupion, Dolores/AAL-2232-2020; MOYA-LARANO, JORDI/K-8596-2014","Melguizo-Ruiz, Nereida/0000-0001-5153-5281; Ruiz-Lupion, Dolores/0000-0002-1309-315X; MOYA-LARANO, JORDI/0000-0001-7141-3206","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (European funds FEDER) [CGL2010-18602, CGL2015-66192-R]; Spanish Organismo Autonomo de Parques Nacionales [020/2008]; Junta de Andalucia (European funds FEDER) [P12-RNM-1521]; FPI fellowshipSpanish Government [BES-2011-043505]; Spanish Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y DeporteSpanish Government [FPU13/04933]","This work was funded by grants CGL2010-18602 and CGL2015-66192-R from the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (European funds FEDER), 020/2008 from Spanish Organismo Autonomo de Parques Nacionales, and P12-RNM-1521 from Junta de Andalucia (European funds FEDER) and the FPI fellowship (BES-2011-043505) to N.M.R.D.

Reviewing theoretical and experimental literature relevant to the marine photic zone, we argue that there is a wide spectrum of phenomena, including single cell activity of prokaryotes, microbial biodiversity at different levels of resolution, ecosystem functioning, regional biogeochemical features and evolution at different timescales; that all can be understood as variations over a common principle, summarised in what has been termed the Killing-the-Winner' (KtW) motif.

How these differences are maintained in response to changes in population density is unknown, particularly in large mammals, such as ungulates. Using a behavioral reaction norm ( BRN) framework, we examined how among- and within-individual variation in social connectedness, measured using social network analyses, change as a function of population density. We studied a captive herd of elk ( Cervus canadensis) separated into a group of male elk and a group of female elk. Males and females were exposed to three different density treatments and we recorded social associations between individuals with proximity-detecting radio-collars fitted to elk. We constructed social networks using dyadic association data and calculated three social network metrics reflective of social connectedness: eigenvector centrality, graph strength, and degree. Elk exhibited consistent individual differences in social connectedness across densities; however, they showed little individual variation in their response to changes in density, i.e., individuals oftentimes responded plastically, but in the same manner to changes in density. Female elk had highest connectedness at an intermediate density. In contrast, male elk increased connectedness with increasing density. Whereas this may suggest that the benefits of social connectedness outweigh the costs of increased competition at higher density for males, females appear to exhibit a threshold in social benefits ( e.g. predator detection and forage information). Our study illustrates the importance of viewing social connectedness as a density-dependent trait, particularly in the context of plasticity. Moreover, we highlight the need to revisit our understanding of density dependence as a population-level phenomenon by accounting for consistent individual differences not only in social connectedness, but likely in other ecological processes ( e.g., predator-prey dynamics, mate choice, disease transfer).","[O'Brien, Paul P.; Vander Wal, Eric] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, St John, NF, Canada; [Webber, Quinn M.

Unsuitable microhabitats have negative consequences for individual growth and survival. Animals, therefore, should fine-tune their location within the habitat by dispersing away from such microhabitats. We studied the suitability of different constant microhabitat conditions for wormlion larvae, a trap-building predator, tested in groups under laboratory conditions. Wormlions construct pit-traps in loose soil and capture small arthropod prey. As wormlions occur in high densities in nature, testing in groups is thus more indicative of their natural behavior than testing individuals. Wormlions responded strongly to biotic conditions-high conspecific density, starvation, and large body mass of conspecifics-by either increasing pit-relocation events or moving away from the microhabitat center to the periphery of the arena, probably opting for a way out. In other instances, individuals increased their distance to the nearest neighbor, thereby changing the spatial pattern toward a more regular pattern, potentially indicating interference competition. The only abiotic condition apparently perceived by wormlions as unsuitable was shallow sand, which led to frequent relocations. The two other abiotic factors-illumination and sand particle size-had no observable effect on behavior, although wormlions in nature always occur under shade in fine sand, and prefer both shade and fine sand particle size under laboratory conditions when given a choice. Under the fine spatial scale of the present experiment, biotic factors appear to be more influential than abiotic ones.","[Katz, Noa; Shavit, Roni; Scharf, Inon] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Pruitt, Jonathan N.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Scharf, I (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, Fac Life Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",scharfi@post.tau.ac.il,"Scharf, Inon/AAF-2343-2020","Scharf, Inon/0000-0002-8506-7161; Pruitt, Jonathan/0000-0003-0326-6755",US-Israel Binational Science FoundationUS-Israel Binational Science Foundation [2013086]; European UnionEuropean Commission [333442],The authors are grateful to the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation [No. 2013086 to I.S. and J.N.P.] and to the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under REA grant agreement [No. 333442] for funding this study.

Using a long-term experiment, where L. dimidiatus were regularly removed from seven patch reefs (removals) for 10 years or left undisturbed (controls) on nine, the effect of conspecifics' presence on recently settled L. dimidiatus juveniles and the relationship between juvenile and adult abundance on control reefs were examined. Repeated sampling 4-40 months after manipulating L. dimidiatus revealed that the abundance of juveniles on removals, compared with controls reefs, was 72 % (95 % CI = 65-79 %) lower; this effect did not vary over time. Thus, decreased colonization was associated with resident conspecific absence and this effect was present after 4 months. Since other studies found 4 months of cleaner absence was too short to affect client abundance-a factor also known to enhance L. dimidiatus colonization-it was likely not involved here. Over 10 years, individual control reefs were almost always occupied by at least one adult (89-100 % of times sampled); but in summer, when L. dimidiatus colonization was highest, juvenile abundance was negatively related with adult abundance at one of two sites, with the expected number of juveniles decreasing by 67 % (95 % CI = 51-83 %) with each additional adult. This suggests a deleterious effect of adults on juveniles at one site, such as competition. Enhanced colonization of juveniles associated with adult presence may partly explain the relative permanence of fish cleaning stations.","Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia","Grutter, AS (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",a.grutter@uq.edu.au,"Grutter, Alexandra S/J-2737-2013","Grutter, Alexandra S/0000-0003-1688-2821",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; University of QueenslandUniversity of Queensland,"Many thanks to M.

The two strains, designated B4 and D5, were isolated concurrently from a freshwater reservoir. Differences between the strains were examined through monitoring interactions with a bacterial competitor, Flectobacillus sp. (FL), and virus-and predator-induced mortality. Batch-type cocultures, designated B4 + FL and D5 + FL, were initiated with a similar biomass ratio among the strains. The proportion of each cell type present in the cocultures was monitored based on clear differences in cell sizes. Following exponential growth for 28 h, the cocultures were amended by the addition of two different concentrations of live or heat-inactivated viruses concentrated from the reservoir. Half of virus-amended treatments were inoculated immediately with an axenic flagellate predator, Poterioochromonas sp. The presence of the predator, of live viruses, and of competition between the strains significantly affected their population dynamics in the experimentally manipulated treatments. While strains B4 and FL appeared vulnerable to environmental viruses, strain D5 did not. Predator-induced mortality had the greatest impact on FL, followed by that on D5 and then B4. The virus-vulnerable B4 strain had smaller cells and lower biomass yield, but it was less subject to grazing. In contrast, the seemingly virus-resistant D5, with slightly larger grazing-vulnerable cells, was competitive with FL. Overall, our data suggest contrasting ecophysiological capabilities and partial niche separation in two coexisting Limnohabitans strains.","[Simek, Karel] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Ctr Biol, Hydrobiol Inst, VVI, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Simek, Karel; Kasalicky, Vojtech] Univ S Bohemia, Fac Sci, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Hahn, Martin W.] Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Limnol, A-5310 Mondsee, Austria; [Weinbauer, Markus G.] CNRS, LOV, Marine Microbial Ecol & Biochem Grp, UMR 7093, F-06234 Villefranche Sur Mer, France","Simek, K (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republic, Ctr Biol, Hydrobiol Inst, VVI, Sadkach 7, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",ksimek@hbu.cas.cz,"Simek, Karel/F-8930-2014; Kasalicky, Vojtech/AAC-2903-2021; Simek, Karel/AAB-1956-2021; Weinbauer, Markus/G-8038-2011; Kasalicky, Vojtech/F-8578-2014; Hahn, Martin W./B-9998-2008; Weinbauer, Markus/ABC-7017-2020","Kasalicky, Vojtech/0000-0002-9132-8321; Simek, Karel/0000-0002-7058-9063; Kasalicky, Vojtech/0000-0002-9132-8321; Hahn, Martin W./0000-0003-0501-2556; Weinbauer, Markus/0000-0002-7697-5571","Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [208/05/0015]; Academy of SciencesEgyptian Academy of Scientific Research and Technology (ASRT) [AV0Z 60170517, MSM 600 766 5801]; KONTAKT [MEB 060702]; ATIPE (CNRS)Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)","This study was largely supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic under research grant 208/05/0015, awarded to K.

As a result, herbivores may not use landscapes uniformly due to spatial differences in perceived predation risk. Wild herbivores forage across these 'landscapes of fear'; however, the extent to which domestic herbivores consider them is generally unknown. Using a grid of artificial food patches and measuring giving up densities (GUDs), we mapped landscapes of fear of free-ranging domestic goats on three substrates. In the first experiment, we related GUDs to landscape variables. Goats preferred feeding in open ground with firm substrate compared to a sandy riverbed or a rocky hillside. We suggest that differences relate to escape potential and the occurrence of ambush sites. Landscape variables that influenced feeding effort were patch visibility and plants next to a patch. In a second experiment, we increased predation risk by adding predator dung and urine into the habitats. In response, feeding effort declined across all three habitats. Furthermore, goats only responded to patch visibility and not plants next to the patches. Better sightlines increase predator detection and allow individuals to see group members. Our results indicate that predation risk influences the extent to which free-ranging domestic herbivores utilise landscapes. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed predation by chaetognaths on winter-spawned fish larvae and on the planktonic food of fish larvae in February 1992, December 1992, and February 1993 off the southeastern U.S. coast. Feeding rates of chaetognaths were calculated from gut content analysis and experimentally determined digestion rates-and combined with estimates of in situ densities of predators and prey. Chaetognath and larval fish distributions overlapped temporally and spatially on all dates. Densities of chaetognaths averaged 10 to 67 m(-3), and fish larvae averaged 0.1 to 1.8 m(-3). Only 1 fish larva was found in 6718 chaetognath guts examined. Effects of chaetognath predation on the abundant small prey consumed by the small fish larvae present in December 1992 and February 1993 were negligible (0.3 to 0.7% consumed d(-1)). In February 1992, however, chaetognaths consumed up to 44 % d(-1) of standing stocks of large copepods that also were prey of the large fish larvae present on that dale. We conclude that chaetognaths were not important predators of fish larvae during this study, but may, at times, consume substantial amounts of the copepod populations, which are shared by fish larvae.","UNIV MARYLAND, HORN POINT ENVIRONM LAB, CTR ENVIRONM & ESTUARINE STUDIES, CAMBRIDGE, MD 21613 USA",,,"Purcell, Jennifer E/E-9991-2011",,,,,52,65,71,0,14,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The changes in spatial patterns brought about by the ants were greater when a higher proportion of seeds was removed but were independent of initial seed density. These spatial changes and differences in seed density were examined for their effects on plant size and reproduction. Gini values were calculated to determine inequalities. As the inequality in space among individual plants increased, the variation in final biomass increased. The number of individuals reproducing was constant among treatments, and yet seed production per plant was significantly greater for populations in which the spatial pattern was influenced by seed predation. The decrease in density and changed spatial pattern, due to previous seed predation, resulted in a few individuals having much more space than others and consequently producing many more seeds. The increase in reproductive effort per flat was much greater than could be explained by the changing density alone. Our experiment demonstrates that spatial inequality, such as that generated by seed predators, can be more important than density in generating size inequalities in plant populations.

The problem of hybridization has had different effects in different areas. In non-Mediterranean regions pure forms of wildcats became almost extinct, while in Mediterranean regions genetic introgression is a rare phenomenon. The study of the potential factors that prevent the gene flow in areas of lower hybridization may be key to wildcat conservation. We studied the population size and spatial segregation of wildcats and domestic cats in a typical Mediterranean area of ancient sympatry, where no evidence of hybridization had been detected by genetic studies. Camera trapping of wild-living cats and walking surveys of stray cats in villages were used for capture-recapture estimations of abundance and spatial segregation. Results showed (i) a low density of wildcats and no apparent presence of putative hybrids; (ii) a very low abundance of feral cats in spite of the widespread and large population sources of domestic cats inhabiting villages; (iii) strong spatial segregation between wildcats and domestic/feral cats; and (iv) no relationship between the size of the potential population sources and the abundance of feral cats. Hence, domestic cats were limited in their ability to become integrated into the local habitat of wildcats. Ecological barriers (habitat preferences, food limitations, intra-specific and intra-guild competition, predation) may explain the severe divergences of hybridization impact observed at a biogeographic level. This has a direct effect on key conservation strategies for wildcats (i.e., control of domestic cats). (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.","[Gil-Sanchez, J.

We continually sampled populations within 177 trees at primarily two sites in the Ozark National Forest in Arkansas throughout three (2-yr) generations. The first cohort (adults emerged in 2003) was sampled during a severe population outbreak, whereas the second and third (2005 and 2007) were sampled during the population crash that followed. Generation mortality was 94% in 2003 and 99% in both 2005 and 2007. Estimates of apparent mortality indicated that the E. rufulus population crash likely occurred during or before the first overwintering period (2003-2004) of the generation that emerged as adults in 2005. We found limited evidence for density dependent mortality, which suggest that intraspecific competition after the first active feeding period was apparently not an important mortality factor during E. rufulus development. Life tables revealed that E. rufulus larvae generally experienced the greatest apparent mortality during the second summer of active feeding (80-94%) when larvae were feeding in, and moving between phloem and sapwood. The least apparent mortality was incurred during the following spring and early summer (26-67%) when late stage larvae and pupae were deepest and most protected within sapwood or heartwood tunnels. We found very little evidence for mortality from associated species. Scarring of vascular tissue in response to E. rufulus feeding occurred during early life stages and may be an important tree resistance mechanism and E. rufulus mortality factor.","[Haavik, Laurel J.; Crook, Damon J.; Fierke, Melissa K.; Galligan, Larry D.; Stephen, Fred M.] 1 Univ Arkansas, Dept Entomol, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Haavik, LJ (corresponding author), Great Lakes Forestry Ctr, 1219 Queen St E, Sault Ste Marie, ON P6A 2E5, Canada.",ljhaavik@gmail.com,,"Haavik, Laurel/0000-0002-7749-9095","University of Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station; USDA Forest Service, Pineville, LA [03-CA-11083150-020, 03-CS-11083150-010]; USDA Forest Service, Atlanta, GAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service [03-CA-11083150-020, 03-CS-11083150-010]; USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, Asheville, NCUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service [05-CA-11330124-123, 09-CA-11330124-080]","The authors thank Dana Kinney, Vaughn Salisbury, Rose Ann Barnhill, Josh Jones, John Riggins, Brent Kelley, Chris Abbott, Vanessa Muilenburg, Tracy Dahl, Leah Aquino, Jarrett Bates, Matt McCall, Ricky Corder, Robin Verble, and Geoff Gardner for field and lab assistance.

We investigated seasonal changes in site occupancy in a sexually dimorphic, harem-forming insect, the Auckland tree weta (Hemideina thoracica). First we established artificial cavities as diurnal refuge cavities and potential harem guarding sites. We then examined cavity occupancy changes, and, based on our knowledge of prior occupants, determined sex-specific patterns of arrival, departure, and aggregation at a population level throughout the year. Both season and the sex of prior occupants influenced weta occupancy patterns. Most observations were of single females. However, both males and females moved into cavities previously occupied by a weta of the opposite sex more often than expected by chance alone. Females avoided cavities where other females were present, except during summer when most harems formed. In early summer, male and female tree weta previously living apart began co-habiting. Generally there was little relationship between the number and sex of the weta inside cavities and female departure rates from cavities. Males who were sharing with other males departed cavities more frequently than single males, as might be expected in a polygynous species with male male combat. Males were less likely to depart if they were sharing a cavity with a harem of more than two females during the summer autumn period. Analysis of departure rates from artificial cavities indicates males are more mobile than females only in winter and spring. Based on our arrival and departure data, and high occupancy of artificial cavities, we suggest that female weta at this site are mobile and may search for mates during the summer. The data are consistent with a polygynandrous mating system as inferred for other tree weta species (Hemideina spp.).","[Wehi, Priscilla M.] Univ Waikato, Dept Biol Sci, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Jorgensen, Murray] Univ Waikato, Dept Stat, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand; [Morgan-Richards, Mary] Massey Univ, Inst Nat Resources, Palmerston North, New Zealand","Wehi, PM (corresponding author), Univ Otago, CSAFE, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.",cilla.wehi@otago.ac.nz,"Morgan-Richards, Mary/B-4444-2011","Jorgensen, Murray/0000-0002-9482-016X","New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and TechnologyNew Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology [UOWX0501]; Te Tipu Putaiao Postdoctoral Fellowship [MAUX0905]","We warmly thank Clive Dalton for designing and building the weta refuges.

During summer the thermocline is at a depth of 4-5 m, and the hypolimnion is filled with H2S already by mid-June, making 60-75% of the bottom area inaccessible to fish. The native fish fauna is dominated by planktivorous roach (Rutilus rutilus). A test stocking of silver carp (Hypophthahnichthys molitrix) together with an unplanned and erroneous stocking of common carp (Cyprinus carpio), coupled with an incorrectly calculated strong stocking of eel (Anguilla anguilla), which assumed that the total lake area yielded fish food organisms, brought about a strong depression of the food biomass available to native fish. Both silver carp and common carp showed a pattern of behaviour which only partly agreed with results obtained in experimental ponds prior to lake stocking. At least for 10 years there was a very low zooplankton biomass (mostly below I mg/l fresh weight) caused by silver carp and a strongly reduced benthos biomass (frequently below 1 g/m(2) fresh weight) caused by common carp and eel on H,S-free bottom areas. Despite this extreme situation, which lasted for 20 years and is rarely found in lakes elsewhere, it was not possible to demonstrate negative effects on the native fish fauna comprising 16 species. Also the dominance pattern seems uninfluenced in the long run. A strong decline of the catchable roach stock was observed for some years, but the stock reappeared soon in comparable quantity. During the time of roach stock depression the individual growth of roach (and common carp) was particularly low. Nevertheless, roach succeeded in reproduction during this time in spite of the reduced zooplankton and detritus concentrations. Fry numbers per year ranged from 500-15 000 individuals/ha. The pike perch (Stizostedion lucioperca) was perhaps the most endangered species of all those living at small population numbers in the lake, since its fry is confined to the limnion where competition from silver carp and adult roach and perhaps predation by roach is highest. However the pike perch stock remained unchanged at the low level of 1950, the time prior of carp and eel stocking. All other rare species of Lake Heiliger See spawn in the littoral zone where fry survival conditions were less impacted. In summary, we present more evidence that the fish fauna of cyprinid lakes is more robust than in salmonid lakes. The regulation capacity of fish communities of eutrophic lakes seems to be able to offset even severe direct and indirect influences of fisheries management.","Inst Inland Fisheries Potsdam Sacrow, D-14476 Gross Glienicke, Germany","Bramick, U (corresponding author), Inst Inland Fisheries Potsdam Sacrow, D-14476 Gross Glienicke, Germany.",uwe.braemick@ifb-potsdam.de,"Mehner, Thomas/B-8665-2008","Mehner, Thomas/0000-0002-3619-165X",,,,63,9,10,0,22,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",0075-9511,1873-5851,,LIMNOLOGICA,Limnologica,APR,2003,33,1,,,,,10,28,,10.1016/S0075-9511(03)80004-X,,,19,Limnology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,680JR,WOS:000182973300003,,Bronze,,,2021-09-27,

This study documents the temporal periodicity of two common resident predators of juvenile reef fishes, Cephalopholis cyanostigma (rockcod) and Pseudochromis fuscus (dottyback) and compares these to the activity and foraging pattern of a common prey species, juvenile Pomacentrus moluccensis (lemon damselfish). Detailed observations of activity in the field and using 24 h infrared video in the laboratory revealed that the two predators had very different activity patterns. C. cyanostigma was active over the whole 24 h period, with a peak in feeding strikes at dusk and increased activity at both dawn and dusk, while P. fuscus was not active at night and had its highest strike rates at midday. The activity and foraging pattern of P. moluccensis directly opposes that of C. cyanostigma with individuals reducing strike rate and intraspecific aggression at both dawn and dusk, and reducing distance from shelter and boldness at dusk only. Juveniles examined were just outside the size-selection window of P. fuscus. We suggest that the relatively predictable diel behaviour of coral reef predators results from physiological factors such as visual sensory abilities, circadian rhythmicity, variation in hunting profitability, and predation risk at different times of the day. Our study suggests that the diel periodicity of P. moluccensis behaviour may represent a response to increased predation risk at times when both the ability to efficiently capture food and visually detect predators is reduced.","[McCormick, Mark I.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","McCormick, MI (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",mark.mccormick@jcu.edu.au,"McCormick, Mark I/J-8301-2014","McCormick, Mark I/0000-0001-9289-1645",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0985015],"This research was funded through an Australian Research Council Discovery grant to MIM (DP0985015).

Its success is dependent on a number of factors related to the abiotic conditions and to the interactions between pests and biological control agents. In particular, when multiple predator species are introduced to suppress one pest, competitive interactions might occur, including intraguild predation (IGP). In tomato crops, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch is a very problematic phytophagous mite and its control is not yet satisfactory. In 2012 and 2013, the ability of a potential new predatory mite Phytoseiulus macropilis (Banks) was assessed, alone and in the presence of Macrolophus pygmaeus Rambur. Macrolophus pygmaeus is a polyphagous mirid supposed to predate on P. macropilis. Both years, under greenhouse conditions, the effectiveness of the two predators was compared between the following treatments: T. urticae, T. urticae + P. macropilis, T. urticae + M. pygmaeus, and T. urticae + P. macropilis + M. pygmaeus. The number of arthropods per tomato plant over time indicated that P. macropilis well-controlled the population of T. urticae, whereas M. pygmaeus had a very limited impact. Furthermore, there was no evidence of IGP between the two predators but in the presence of M. pygmaeus, P. macropilis tended to have a more clumped spatial distribution. Further studies should clarify the number and location of inoculation points to optimize the control of T. urticae by P. macropilis.","[Gigon, Vincent] Univ Appl Sci & Arts Western Switzerland HES SO, Hepia Geneva, CH-1254 Jussey, Switzerland; [Camps, Cedric] Agroscope Inst Plant Prod Sci, CH-1964 Conthey, Switzerland; [Le Corff, Josiane] Agrocampus Ouest Angers, UMR IGEPP 1349, F-49045 Angers, France","Le Corff, J (corresponding author), Agrocampus Ouest Angers, UMR IGEPP 1349, 2 Rue Notre, F-49045 Angers, France.",josiane.lecorff@agrocampus-ouest.fr,"Gigon, Vincent/AAB-2685-2020; Herrero, Carlos Camps/L-3073-2017","Herrero, Carlos Camps/0000-0002-0648-5403; Camps, Cedric/0000-0003-1086-5668",University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Western Switzerland (HES-SO) [SAGEX 30225],"We would like to thank Jean Klieber and Pierre Massot for data collection, Serge Fischer for providing the initial colony of P. macropilis, Thomas Steinger for his help with data analysis, and Maxime Ferrero, Dominique Fleury, and Serge Fischer for constructive suggestions during the project.

Species richness per unit area increased with distance to mainland with diversity being highest on the most isolated islands. We detected neither a positive species-area relationship, nor significant differences in species richness among island size classes, or between islands and the mainland. Nonetheless, carabid assemblages distinctly differed on islands < 1 ha in area and gradually approached the structure of mainland assemblages as island area increased. Small islands were characterised by abundant populations of small-bodied, winged species and few if any large-bodied, flightless species like Carabus taedatus Fabricius. Our findings suggest that neither the passive sampling hypothesis nor the theory of island biogeography adequately explain carabid beetle diversity patterns observed among islands in Lac la Ronge. Instead, we hypothesise that population processes such as higher extinction rates of large-bodied, flightless species and the associated release of smaller-bodied, flying species from intra-guild predation on small islands contribute to observed differences in the structure of carabid assemblages between islands.","[Bell, Aaron J.; Nielsen, Scott E.; Spence, John R.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 751 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Bell, Aaron J.; Phillips, Iain D.] Saskatchewan Wildlife Federat, Troutreach Saskatchewan, 9 Lancaster Rd, Moose Jaw, SK S7J 1M8, Canada; [Phillips, Iain D.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, 112 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada; [Phillips, Iain D.] Water Secur Agcy Saskatchewan, Integrated Water Serv, Water Qual Serv, 101-108 Res Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3R3, Canada","Bell, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 751 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.; Bell, AJ (corresponding author), Saskatchewan Wildlife Federat, Troutreach Saskatchewan, 9 Lancaster Rd, Moose Jaw, SK S7J 1M8, Canada.",ajbell@ualberta.ca,"Nielsen, Scott/C-2842-2013; Nielsen, Scott/O-7482-2019; Phillips, Iain/L-3116-2019","Nielsen, Scott/0000-0002-9754-0630; Nielsen, Scott/0000-0002-9754-0630; ",Ministry of Environment through the Boreal Initiative Fund; National Science and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Walter H.

Females of the monophagous shield bug Parastrachia japonensis Scott provision their nymph-containing nests with high-quality drupes of the single host tree, Schoepfia jasminodora , a resource that is poor and unstable, under an array of variable environmental constraints. 2. Although the number of drupes provisioned is correlated positively with enhanced nymphal development and survival, there is great variability in the number of drupes that females provide. 3. The ability to adjust behaviour and/or physiology, i.e. make risk-sensitive decisions, should be adaptive for organisms such as P. japonensis that are confronted with extreme variability in food availability and in the conditions under which they must forage. To assess whether females of this species use risk-sensitivity to improve their provisioning success, data on the parameters of provisioning activity obtained during a long-term field study were analysed. The relationships between variation in three female-controlled factors during nesting (nest site, active stage during the provisioning season, duration of provisioning activity) and the conditions of three environmental factors (drupe availability, intraspecific competition, weather) were examined. The relationships between all of these factors and provisioning capacity of females were investigated. 5. Nest site, intraspecific competition, and timing of provisioning activity only affected provisioning capacity when drupe availability was extremely good or bad or weather was particularly bad. 6. The findings suggest that females use risk-sensitive decisions to increase provisioning capacity under extreme conditions of low and high drupe availability and inclement weather.","Saga Univ, Fac Agr, Saga 840, Japan; Saga Univ, Saga Med Sch, Saga 840, Japan","Filippi, L (corresponding author), Hofstra Univ, New Coll, 130 Hofstra Univ, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA.",NUCLXF@Hofstra.edu,,,,,,37,14,14,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Through a two-months capture-recapture study of 646 photo-identified tadpoles of Alytes cisternasii we aimed to estimate tadpole survival in isolated temporary stream pools - their main habitat - as well as to evaluate how pool characteristics and intraspecific competition (tadpole density) affect this parameter. Photo-identification was performed with the help of the software (IS)-S-3. We used the POPAN formulation of the Jolly-Seber model to estimate survival rates and population size in 9 stream pools. Tadpole density varied from similar to 1 to 40 tadpoles . m(-2). Tadpole weekly survival was relatively high, varying from 75 to 99% . week(-1). Among-pool differences in survival were best explained by pool depth, and not by tadpole density or other pool characteristics. The lower survival estimates were obtained for the deep pools. The very high survival estimates for some pools are an indication that this type of discrete habitat may play an important role for this species. To our knowledge, this is the first time that photo-identification is used to obtain estimates for survival and density of tadpoles.","[Ribeiro, Joana; Rebelo, Rui] FCUL, DBA, Ctr Biol Ambiental, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal","Ribeiro, J (corresponding author), FCUL, DBA, Ctr Biol Ambiental, Bloco C2,Piso 5, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal.",joanateixeiraribeiro@gmail.com,"Rebelo, Rui/D-7054-2013; Ribeiro, Joana/B-7777-2018","Rebelo, Rui/0000-0003-2544-1470; Ribeiro, Joana/0000-0002-3755-5785",FCT (Portugal)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology,We sincerely want to thank Pedro Leitao and Jorge Henriques for helping on the fieldwork and Dr. Jorge Cadima for the advices on the statistical analysis and to B.

Results of prey choice experiments involving 50 species of mites belonging to 24 families of Oribatida and one family of Uropodina demonstrated that beetles feed mostly on ptyctimous Phthiracaridae (over 90% of prey) and only occasionally on Achipteriidae, Chamobatidae, Steganacaridae, Oribatellidae, Ceratozetidae, Euphthiracaridae and Galumnidae. The average number of mites consumed per beetle per day was 0.27 +/- 0.07, and the entire feeding process took 2.15-33.7 h and showed a clear linear relationship with prey body length. Observations revealed a previously unknown mechanism for capturing prey in Scydmaeninae in which a droplet of liquid that exudes from the mouth onto the dorsal surface of the predator's mouthparts adheres to the mite's cuticle. Morphological adaptations associated with this strategy include the flattened distal parts of the maxillae, whereas the mandibles play a minor role in capturing prey. Mechanisms for overcoming the prey's defences depended on the body form of the mite. When attacking oribatids that adopt the ptychoid defence (encapsulation) Euconnus opened the prodorsum and pressed the anal and genital plates deeply into the idiosoma, whereas it fed on all other mites by entering their bodies through small gnathosomal or/and genital openings, after breaking off mouthparts or/and genital plates. The preferential feeding of a specialized and locally abundant ant-like stone beetle on one family of Oribatida, documented here for the first time, has implications for the population dynamics of the prey and raises questions about predator-prey co-evolution and costs of an unusually prolonged period spent feeding when at risk from competition and attack by larger predators, typical of the habitats where Scydmaeninae occur.","[Jaloszynski, Pawel] Univ Wroclaw, Museum Nat Hist, PL-50335 Wroclaw, Poland; [Olszanowski, Ziemowit] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Anim Taxon & Ecol, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland","Jaloszynski, P (corresponding author), Univ Wroclaw, Museum Nat Hist, Sienkiewicza 21, PL-50335 Wroclaw, Poland.",scydmaenus@yahoo.com; olszanow@amu.edu.pl,,"Olszanowski, Ziemowit/0000-0002-5392-2442",,,,33,25,31,0,22,"CZECH ACAD SCI, INST ENTOMOLOGY",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"BRANISOVSKA 31, CESKE BUDEJOVICE 370 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",,1802-8829,,EUR J ENTOMOL,Eur.

Through manipulation of vole densities within enclosed areas it was shown that reproduction, recruitment, and body growth rate in introduced populations were negatively affected by high previous density. In addition, female movement patterns shifted, and territoriality as well as home-range size was increased after high density. The observed changes in female spacing-behaviour suggested that negative effects of previous density were partly mediated by social interactions, and agreed with the finding that smaller (less competitive) females were the ones suffering most from increased competition. Contrary to expectations from recent work, predation could be excluded as the cause of delayed density-dependence in this study.

However, in contrast to cercopithecine primates, spotted hyenas regularly hunt antelope and compete with group-mates for access to kills, which are extremely rich food sources, but also rare and ephemeral. This unique occurrence of baboon-like sociality among top-level predators has favoured the evolution of many unusual traits in this species. We briefly review the relevant socio-ecology of spotted hyenas, document great demographic variation but little variation in social structure across the species range, and describe the long-term fitness consequences of rank-related variation in resource access among clan-mates. We then summarize patterns of genetic relatedness within and between clans, including some from a population that had recently gone through a population bottleneck, and consider the roles of sexually dimorphic dispersal and female mate choice in the generation of these patterns. Finally, we apply social network theory under varying regimes of resource availability to analyse the effects of kinship on the stability of social relationships among members of one large hyena clan in Kenya. Although social bonds among both kin and non-kin are weakest when resource competition is most intense, hyenas sustain strong social relationships with kin year-round, despite constraints imposed by resource limitation. Our analyses suggest that selection might act on both individuals and matrilineal kin groups within clans containing multiple matrilines.","[Holekamp, Kay E.; Smith, Jennifer E.; Watts, Heather E.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Holekamp, Kay E.; Smith, Jennifer E.; Strelioff, Christopher C.] Michigan State Univ, BEACON Ctr Study Evolut Act, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Smith, Jennifer E.; Strelioff, Christopher C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Smith, Jennifer E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ctr Soc & Genet, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Strelioff, Christopher C.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Microbiol & Mol Genet, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Van Horn, Russell C.] Inst Conservat Res, Escondido, CA 92027 USA; [Watts, Heather E.] Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA","Holekamp, KE (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",holekamp@msu.edu,"Holekamp, Kay E/G-6054-2010; Smith, Jennifer/B-9099-2008","Van Horn, Russell/0000-0002-5789-8822; Watts, Heather/0000-0002-9888-825X","University of California Los Angeles Center for Society and Genetics; David and Lucille Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; Kenya Wildlife Trust; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BNS8706939, BNS902146, IBN9309805, IBN9630667, IBN9906445, IBN0113170, IBN034338, IOB0618022, IOS0819437, IOS1121474, OIA0939454]; Division Of Integrative Organismal SystemsNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1121474] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank the Kenyan Ministry for Education, Science and Technology, the Kenya Wildlife Service, the Narok County Council, the senior warden of the Masai Mara National Reserve, Brian Heath and the Mara Conservancy for permission to conduct this research.

The most common hypothesis explaining why gulls (Laridae) select roof-tops for nesting has been that population growth rates are higher than territory vacancy rates in traditional (island) habitat, suggesting that roof-tops are a non-preferred habitat. Roof-top habitat may actually be equal to or higher quality than island habitat as anthropogenic food is abundant and lower nest density may lead to lower intraspecific aggression and predation. During 2011-2012, reproductive effort and success was monitored in a regionally declining population of Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) nesting on roof-tops in Portland, Maine, USA, and a nearby island-nesting colony on Appledore Island, Maine. Clutch size was lower in the roof-top colony, but egg volume did not differ between sites. Herring Gulls in the roof-top colony had lower hatching success but greater survival to day 30 for chicks that hatched than for those breeding in the island colony. The average number of chicks per nest to reach day 30 was 0.72 on the roof-tops and 0.84 on the island. This shows, therefore, that roof-top nesting may be an adaptive reproductive strategy even under scenarios with reduced competition for nesting territories on traditional nesting islands.","[Perlut, Noah G.] Univ New England, Dept Environm Studies, 11 Hills Beach Rd, Biddeford, ME 04005 USA; [Bonter, David N.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Ellis, Julie C.] Tufts Univ, Dept Infect Dis & Global Hlth, Cummings Sch Vet Med, 200 Westboro Rd, North Grafton, MA 01536 USA; [Friar, Margaret S.] Univ New England, Dept Biol, 11 Hills Beach Rd, Biddeford, ME 04005 USA","Perlut, NG (corresponding author), Univ New England, Dept Environm Studies, 11 Hills Beach Rd, Biddeford, ME 04005 USA.",nperlut@une.edu,"Ellis, Julie/ABF-4882-2020; Bonter, David/H-1313-2013","Bonter, David/0000-0003-1768-1941",University of New England; Cornell Lab of Ornithology Redhead Fund; Cornell Rawlings Presidential Research Scholars program,"The University of New England provided support for this project.

Post-release studies were conducted to ascertain establishment, spread and initial impact of the seed-feeding weevil Cissoanthonomus tuberculipennis, a biological control agent released against balloon vine Cardiospermum grandiflorum in South Africa. CLIMEX was used to identify areas where C. tuberculipennis was likely to establish. Comparison were also made of C. tuberculipennis abundance in its native (Argentina) and introduced (South Africa) ranges to determine its relative fitness in the two regions. The weevil successfully overwintered at 12 of 14 release sites and was thus considered to be established after twelve months. The weevil has spread rapidly from all the established release sites in South Africa, confirming CLIMEX predictions conducted prior to its release. The percentage of seeds damaged by C. tuberculipennis across all study sites in South Africa after 12 months was over two-fold greater than in Argentina. The study suggests that C. tuberculipennis has responded to increased resource availability in South Africa, where there is little competition from co-occurring native lepidopteran species which are scarce on the same food resource.","[Simelane, David O.; Mawela, Khethani, V] ARC PHP, Private Bag X134, ZA-0121 Queenswood, South Africa","Mawela, KV (corresponding author), ARC PHP, Private Bag X134, ZA-0121 Queenswood, South Africa.",MawelaK@arc.agric.za,,"Simelane, David/0000-0002-4767-4358",Natural Resources Management Programme of the South African Department of Environmental Affairs; National Research Foundation,"We are grateful to our research partners at the Fundacion para el Estudio de Especies Invasivas (FUEDEI) and Instituto de Botanica del Nordeste-Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (IBONE), Argentina, for facilitating field studies and identification of natural enemies of balloon vine.

Animals in a low energetic state should accept higher risk than animals with larger energy reserves. In mammals, energy expenditure by females on gestation and lactation may exceed the relatively low cost of sperm production by males. It follows, if reproductive costs are indeed higher for females than for males, that reproductive females may be more likely than males to trade safety for food. Thus, we evaluated the use of safe versus risky foraging patches by male and female meadow voles using putatively safe and risky habitats. We also used behavioural trials to assess whether sexual differences in personality could account for any differences in patch use. Voles preferred to forage in safe patches over risky ones. There was no difference between male and female voles, or between reproductive and non-reproductive individuals, in their respective use of safe versus risky foraging patches. Personality also had no effect on patch choice. The results are consistent with recent studies on other species that have failed to find differences in reproductive costs between the sexes. Experiments on foraging behaviour might thus provide simple and repeatable tests for sexual differences and similarities in reproductive costs.","[Halliday, William D.; Morris, Douglas W.; Devito, Jordan A.; Start, Denon M.] Lakehead Univ, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada","Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",dmorris@lakeheadu.ca,,"Halliday, William/0000-0001-7135-076X; Morris, Douglas/0000-0003-4515-9261",,,,45,4,4,0,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1195-6860,2376-7626,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2014,21,1,,,,,61,68,,10.2980/21-1-3689,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AZ5UR,WOS:000348286800007,,,,,2021-09-27,

Despite the wealth of information on their ecology and behaviour, little attention has been paid to their demography or population status. We studied the demographic status of the two species along their common distribution zone in western, central and south-eastern India. Bonnet macaques were largely found in forest areas whereas rhesus macaques were observed more often in human-dominated habitats. The troop sizes of the two species also tended to be largest in different habitats, bonnet macaques in forested areas and rhesus macaques in urban areas. We suggest that the presence of large numbers of rhesus macaques in anthropogenic areas in south-eastern India is not a natural phenomenon but has been caused by human intervention. The bonnet macaque population has decreased in number in the common distribution zone, and as this species, unlike the rhesus macaque, is endemic to India, we strongly recommend the need to reassess its conservation status.

Recent analyses suggest a strong likelihood of competition between eutherian predators and the endangered spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), although experiments are required to confirm this. If competition does occur, what are its likely effects on the long-term survival of spotted-tailed quoll populations? We used population viability analysis (PVA) to predict the fate of a hypothetical quoll population under various scenarios of competition. PVA showed that spotted-tailed quoll populations may be susceptible to extinction when faced with high densities of competitors. Model scenarios simulating exploitation competition and/or intraguild killing greatly reduced the population's probability of survival, leading in the worst-case scenario to almost certain extinction.","[Glen, A.

Ecological differences across environments can alter the context of sexual selection, yet little research has addressed how this may influence the rapid, divergent evolution of male genitalia. Using the model system of Bahamas mosquitofish (Gambusia hubbsi) undergoing ecological speciation across blue holes, we used geometric morphometric methods to test (i) whether male genital shape (the small, approximately 1mm long, distal tip of the sperm-transfer organ, the gonopodium) has diverged between populations with and without predatory fish and (ii) whether any observed divergence has a genetic basis. We additionally examined the effects of genetic relatedness and employed model selection to investigate other environmental factors (i.e. interspecific competition, adult sex ratio and resource availability) that could potentially influence genital shape via changes in sexual selection. Predation regime comprised the most important factor associated with male genital divergence in this system, although sex ratio and some aspects of resource availability had suggestive effects. We found consistent, heritable differences in male genital morphology between predation regimes: Bahamas mosquitofish coexisting with predatory fish possessed more elongate genital tips with reduced soft tissue compared with counterparts inhabiting blue holes without predatory fish. We suggest this may reflect selection for greater efficiency of sperm transfer and fertilization during rapid and often forced copulations in high-predation populations or differences in sexual conflict between predation regimes. Our study highlights the potential importance of ecological variation, particularly predation risk, in indirectly generating genital diversity.","[Heinen-Kay, J.

The literature, however, shows a large variability in outcomes, suggesting that we are unable to create mixtures that consistently suppress insect pests and attract natural enemies. A key gap in our understanding of how cultivar mixtures influence pest control is that few studies have examined the plant traits or mechanisms by which cultivar diversity affects pests and their interactions with natural enemies. The diversity of plant chemistry in a cultivar mixture is one trait dimension that is likely influential for insect ecology because chemical traits alter how predators and herbivores forage and interact. To understand how plant chemical diversity influences herbivores and their interactions with predators, we fully crossed predator presence or absence with monocultures, bicultures, and tricultures of three chemotypes of tomato that differed in odor diversity (terpenes) or surface chemistry (acyl sugars) in a caged field experiment. We found that the direct effects of plant chemotype diversity on herbivore performance were strongest in bicultures and depended on herbivore sex, and these effects typically acted through growth rather than survival. The effects of chemotype diversity on top-down pest suppression by natural enemies differed between classes of chemical diversity. Odor diversity (terpenes) interfered with the ability of predators to hunt effectively, whereas diversity in surface chemistry (acyl sugars) did not. Our results suggest that phytochemical diversity can contribute to pest suppression in agroecosystems, but that implementing it will require engineering cultivar mixtures using trait-based approaches that account for the biology of the pests and natural enemies in the system.","[Hauri, Kayleigh C.; Glassmire, Andrea E.; Wetzel, William C.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Hauri, Kayleigh C.; Glassmire, Andrea E.; Wetzel, William C.] Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolut & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Wetzel, William C.] Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Wetzel, William C.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Wetzel, William C.] Michigan State Univ, AgBioRes, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Hauri, KC (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.; Hauri, KC (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolut & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",haurikay@msu.edu,,"Glassmire, Andrea/0000-0003-3286-5642; Hauri, Kayleigh/0000-0003-1920-1884; Wetzel, William/0000-0001-5390-6824",Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2018-67013-28065]; W.

Effects of this introduced insectivore on invertebrate communities and ecosystem processes, such as nutrient cycling, are largely unknown. In two study sites on the Island of Hawaii, we studied the top-down effects of E. coqui on aerial, herbivorous, and leaf litter invertebrates; herbivory, plant growth, and leaf litter decomposition rates; and leaf litter and throughfall chemistry over 6 months. We found that E. coqui reduced all invertebrate communities at one of the two study sites. Across sites, E. coqui lowered herbivory rates, increased NH4+ P concentrations in throughfall, increased Mg, N, P, and K in decomposing leaf litter, increased new leaf production of Psidium cattleianum, and increased leaf litter decomposition rates of Metrosideros polymorpha. In summary, E. coqui effects on invertebrates differed by site, but E. coqui effects on ecosystem processes were similar across sites. Path analyses suggest that E. coqui increased the number of new P. cattleianum leaves and leaf litter decomposition rates of M. polymorpha by making nutrients more available to plants and microbes rather than through changes in the invertebrate community. Results suggest that E. coqui in Hawaii has the potential to reduce endemic invertebrates and increase nutrient cycling rates, which may confer a competitive advantage to invasive plants in an ecosystem where native species have evolved in nutrient-poor conditions.","[Sin, Hans; Beard, Karen H.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildlife Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Sin, Hans; Beard, Karen H.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Pitt, William C.] USDA, APHIS, WS, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr,Hilo Field Stn, Hilo, HI 96721 USA","Beard, KH (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildlife Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",karen.beard@usu.edu,"Beard, Karen/B-7177-2011","Beard, Karen/0000-0003-4997-2495",,,,44,48,50,2,56,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

The life history and trophic basis of production of the caddisfly grazer Agapetus quadratus were studied in the torrent Gorg Blau, a spring-fed stream on the island of Majorca that dries annually during summer. 2. Quantitative random samples were taken every 2-3 weeks during an annual surficial flow period, from November 2000 to mid-July 2001. Instars of field-collected larvae were determined by measurements of head width and pronotum length, and the sex of all pupae was determined to study sexual dimorphism and sex ratio. 3. Stage-frequency histograms suggested a trivoltine population, with an average cohort time of 4 months. Larval development was asynchronous, with continuous growth and overlapping generations. Recruitment peaks were identified in mid-November, early March and late June, indicative of winter, spring and summer generations. On average, females were larger than males and the mean sex ratio was 2 : 3 (females : males). Population densities and biomasses derived from the field data were used to calculate production and turnover rate. 4. Annual production of A. quadratus in the torrent Gorg Blau (4.80 g dry mass m(-2) year(-1)) was the highest ever reported for the genus, being comparable with that estimated for some insects with rapid development and multiple cohorts. 5. Estimates of production of A. quadratus were combined with foregut content analysis to estimate the fraction of total production derived from the principal food sources: algae and organic detritus. Algae supported a major proportion of the production of this grazer. 6. The low density of predators characteristic of many temporary streams, and the small amplitudes in discharge and temperature during most of the wet period that characterise the spring habitats might allow high levels of grazer production in this particular Mediterranean stream.","Univ Vigo, Area Ecol, Vigo 36200, Spain","Alvarez, M (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Area Ecol, Vigo 36200, Spain.",maruxa@uvigo.es,"Pardo, Isabel/AAN-4795-2020; Alvarez, Maruxa/K-5925-2014","Pardo, Isabel/0000-0002-4553-1310; Alvarez, Maruxa/0000-0001-7486-3704",,,,72,20,21,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

For insectivorous migrants, cues associated with vegetative phenology (e.g. flowering, leaf flush, and leaf loss) may reliably predict the availability of herbivorous arthropods. Here we examined whether migrants use the phenology of five tree species to choose stopover locations, and whether phenology accurately predicts food availability. Using a combination of experimental and observational evidence, we show migrant populations closely track tree phenology, particularly the flowering phenology of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), and preferentially forage in trees with more flowers. Furthermore, the flowering phenology of honey mesquite reliably predicts overall arthropod abundance as well as the arthropods preferred by migrants for food. Together, these results suggest that honey mesquite flowering phenology is an important cue used by migrants to assess food availability quickly and reliably, while in transit during spring migration.","[McGrath, Laura J.; van Riper, Charles, III; Fontaine, Joseph J.] Univ Arizona, US Geol Survey, Sonoran Desert Res Stn, SW Biol Sci Ctr, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [McGrath, Laura J.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Fontaine, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, US Geol Survey, Sonoran Desert Res Stn, SW Biol Sci Ctr, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",fontaine.joseph@gmail.com,"Fontaine, Joseph J/F-6557-2010","Fontaine, Joseph J/0000-0002-7639-9156",US Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; US Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service,"We thank K.

Group size may be a major additional demographic factor affecting social structure through its effects on resource competition. In particular, in Resident Nepotistic Despotic (RND) societies, when resources are uniformly clumped, larger groups are expected to face higher levels of within-group contest competition (WGC) than smaller groups and to respond by showing more highly despotic social relationships than smaller groups. On the other hand, smaller groups are expected to face higher levels of between-group contest competition (BGC) and hence, show greater levels of intragroup tolerance (or lower despotism). While formal models do not explicitly predict this kind of variation within species, many researchers have investigated such intraspecific variation. Thus, we tested these predictions across three groups of free-ranging rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatto) of varying sizes on Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico, where we were able to control for variation in resource-patch contestability and predation risk. Subjects were adult females. For each group, we collected data on (1) exposure and (2) behavioural reactions to WGC and BGC at two independent sets of clumped resources (feeding corrals and drinking stations) and (3) agonistic and affiliative social behaviour, using focal animal, all occurrences, and ad-libitum sampling methods. As predicted, our largest group showed the greatest levels of exposure and behavioural responses to WGC contexts. Likewise, our smallest group showed greatest levels of exposure and responses to BGC contexts. However, aspects of social structure did not vary across groups in directions predicted by the EMFSR. These findings are broadly consistent with several previous comparative tests of the model on other primate taxa that found strong links between group size, ecological factors and contest competitive regimes, but little or no evidence of links with social structure. Our study adds strength to these conclusions given our unique ability to control for several variables on Cayo Santiago. We suggest that our findings may be generalizable to several wild rhesus populations in North India, given that they have lived in similarly dense populations and have been frequently provisioned by humans for thousands of years.","[Balasubramaniam, K.

In tropical areas, mesophotic coral reefs may be an important habitat type for many predators, but their use of these areas has rarely been investigated. We used results of acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analyses to investigate the diel and seasonal movements of Galapagos sharks Carcharhinus galapagensis and giant trevally Caranx ignobilis captured from a mesophotic reef (depth: 50 to 70 m) at an uninhabited Pacific atoll. All predators associated with mesophotic reefs performed horizontal and vertical movements over seasonal and diel time frames. Galapagos sharks performed reverse diel vertical movements, diving deeper during the night than during the day, while giant trevally displayed a mix, with some individuals performing regular diel movements (deep during the day, shallow at night) and others performing reverse vertical diel movements. Trevally used very shallow water during the summer spawning periods. The isotopic compositions of predators suggest they primarily forage in shallow reefs, although approximately 35% of resources came from mesophotic reefs. Similar to their variability in vertical movement strategies, giant trevally occupied a wide range of trophic positions, potentially due to individual specialization in diet and high levels of intra- specific competition. Mesophotic reefs may provide some prey to upper level predators but also serve as a refuge habitat. The frequent movements between habitats suggest that marine predators may function as significant transporters of nutrients, particularly from shallow to mesophotic reefs.","[Papastamatiou, Yannis P.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Scottish Oceans Inst, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; [Papastamatiou, Yannis P.] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Meyer, Carl G.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Kosaki, Randall K.] NOAA NOS Papahanaumokuakea Marine Natl Monument, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA; [Wallsgrove, Natalie J.; Popp, Brian N.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Geol & Geophys, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Papastamatiou, YP (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Scottish Oceans Inst, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland.",ypapastamatiou@gmail.com,,"Popp, Brian/0000-0001-7021-5478; Kosaki, Randall/0000-0003-1363-5702",University of Florida Animal Care Protocol [201105813]; National Geographic Committee for Research ExplorationNational Geographic Society [8951-11]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-1041329]; Scottish Funding Council [HR09011]; Division Of Ocean SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1040810] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We thank the crew of the NOAA research vessel 'Hi'ialakai' for supporting all field work in the NWHI.

Host-parasite interactions are shaped by the broader web of community interactions, from interspecific competition to predator-prey dynamics. Heterospecific scavengers might also affect parasite transmission from infectious carcasses, which can be an important source of infections for some wildlife diseases. 2. A robust scavenger community can quickly remove carcasses and tissue and thus prevent secondary transmission by necrophagy or contact with infectious carcasses. Alternatively, by spreading infectious particles and tissues throughout the environment, scavengers may increase rates of casual contact with pathogens and thus overall transmission. However, there has been little empirical consideration of the contrasting roles that scavengers might play in infectious disease dynamics. 3. We carried out a series of studies to determine the efficiency with which scavenging invertebrates remove carcasses of Long-toed Salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum) larvae and their role in the transmission of frog virus 3 (Genus: Ranavirus, Family: Iridoviridae) from carcasses. We then estimated the functional response of one efficient invertebrate scavenger (Family: Dytiscidae) to increasing carcass densities in field conditions in order to determine the capacity of scavenging invertebrates to consume large amounts of carcass tissue, as may be present at high prevalence sites. 4. We found that removal of infectious carcasses by scavengers strongly reduced transmission to naive larvae. Scavengers were as effective at reducing transmission from a carcass as a physical barrier preventing contact with the carcass. There was little evidence that scavenging released sufficient infectious tissues into the water column to rival direct contact as a route of infection. Moreover, while scavenging rates saturated at increasing carcass densities, consistent with a type II functional response, there were sufficient densities of dytiscid larvae, not to mention other scavenging invertebrates, in a surveyed pond to theoretically prevent transmission from carcasses. 5. Our results suggest that at least in systems in which conspecific necrophagy is common, the scavenger community can play an important role in reducing transmission.","[Le Sage, Mitchell J.; Towey, Bailey D.; Brunner, Jesse L.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Le Sage, MJ (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",mitchell.lesage@vumc.org,"Brunner, Jesse L./B-1692-2013","Brunner, Jesse L./0000-0003-4894-8274",Washington State University School of Biological Sciences Carl H.

Adoption of CA changes weed dynamics and communities and therefore necessitates adjusting weed control methods. The objectives of this review are to summarize literature concerning CA principles and their interactive effects on weed life cycles and community composition, briefly review CA-appropriate cultural practices for additional weed control, and identify areas where further research is needed. No-till systems accumulate seeds near the soil surface where they are more likely to germinate but are also exposed to greater mortality risks through weather variability and predation. Assuming no seed input into the system, germinable seedbanks under no-till decrease more rapidly than under conventional tillage. Reducing tillage may shift weed communities from annual dicots to grassy annuals and perennials. Surface residues lower average soil temperatures and may delay emergence of both crops and weeds. Germination and growth of small-seeded annuals will suffer from restricted light availability, physical growth barriers and potential allelopathic effects from surface residue. Crop rotation affects weeds via allelopathy and altered timing of both crop management and resource demands. Rotations should incorporate crops sown in varied seasons (e.g., autumn and spring), annuals and perennials, different herbicides, and/or various crop families. Literature indicates implementing no-till without crop rotation can result in severe weed problems; greater rotational crop diversity results in easier weed management. Additional cultural practices for CA include: (i) selecting highly competitive varieties; (ii) altering planting dates; (iii) preventing weed seed recruitment; (iv) adjusting planting arrangement, densities, and fertilizer placement; and (v) microbial bio-controls. Further research is needed concerning: (i) the interactive effects of tillage and surface residue on weeds; (ii) the use of models and/or meta-analyses to predict weed responses, and to identify intervention points in CA; and (iii) the weed-suppressive potential of longer (4+ years) rotations.

Adult female crab spiders, Misumena vatia (Clerck) (Araneae: Thomisidae), seldom fail to mate (maximum of 4.3%), even though meeting males infrequently because of low population densities, female-skewed adult sex ratios, and failure to provide males with cues for locating them. Females mate with the first male they encounter, but in contrast to the trade-up strategy of many species in this situation, they usually appear to mate only once. During their short season most females that produce a clutch of eggs do not capture enough prey to reach maximum possible size and fecundity, resulting in a nearly 30% loss of potential production. Another ca. 20% fails to accumulate enough mass to lay a clutch. Nest predation and parasitism, primarily by an ichneumonid wasp and a phorid fly, destroy ca. 25% of the clutches. Thus, failure to mate exacts a much lower cost on adult female M. vatia than do several other factors. Mortality of juveniles greatly exceeds that of the adults, with losses of ca. 90% in the first winter and 35% of those surviving to their second winter.","Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Morse, DH (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Box G-W, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",d_morse@brown.edu,,,US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"Over the period of this study I have been supported by a series of grants from the US National Science Foundation.

However, some studies suggested that the number of neighbours under surveillance may play a more important role in affecting food intake rate than flock size. In addition, the effect of the number of neighbours should also depend on the position of an individual within a flock. To test these hypotheses, we examined the effects of flock size, number of neighbours and position within a flock on foraging time, foraging efficiency and intake rate of wintering greater white-fronted geese, Anser albifrons. We observed the foraging behaviours of 490 individual geese from 71 flocks during December 2016-March 2017 at Shengjin Lake, Anhui, China. We found that mean foraging time, foraging efficiency and intake rate were not influenced by flock size, whereas, at the individual scale these variables were significantly affected by the number of neighbours and position within a flock. Moreover, the effect of the number of neighbours on the foraging parameters did not differ between central and peripheral individuals, despite central individuals always having greater foraging time, foraging efficiency and intake rate regardless of the number of neighbours. Both the decreased foraging time and decreased foraging efficiency indicated a potential increase in cryptic competition from neighbours. More neighbours contributed to a decreased intake rate. Our study highlights the possible effects of cryptic competition among neighbours on their foraging behaviour. We hypothesize that an increase in intraspecific competition between neighbours in areas of shrinking wetland habitats may contribute to population declines of wintering geese and other wildfowl.

However, in recent decades they have been under siege by degradation processes reducing their coral cover and topographic complexity. The coral-algae competition is an important ecological process in the dynamics of coral reefs thus studying is pivotal for understanding the resilience in these systems. Objective: To determine the effect of herbivory on coral-algae competition under different scenarios (using a combination of descriptive and experimental approaches) and two climatic seasons in Capurgana Ray, Colombian Caribbean, in a marine conservation area (Hope Spot). Methods: Between July 2018 and April 2019, the role of herbivory was evaluated, performing an exclusion - no exclusion experiment in 48 coral individuals under different scenarios of interaction between Siderastrea siderea and its surrounding algae (treatments), half of the juvenile corals were covered with 2 400 cm(2) metal boxes fixed to the benthos. The treatments consisted of : Tl= No manipulation (control), T2= Algae removal, T3= Coral damage, T4= Juveniles in contact with artificial algae, T5= T2 + T3, T6= T2 ; T4, T7= T3 ; T4 and T8= T2 T3 I T4. Results: After nine months was found differences between scenarios with and without exclusion (P= 0.006) and the climatic season (P= 0.032), it was found that coral growth was higher when algae were removed in the presence of herbivores (Fisher's LSD, mean + SE 9.871 a 8.298) and the appearance of algae was greater inside the cages than outside them, while the competitive treatment did not show growth interference (P= 0.155). Algae colonized juveniles when their tissue was damaged and herbivory was excluded (mean +/- SE 9.359 +/- 3.901). There were differences in coral growth between seasons, being higher in the dry season (Average 0.0029 +/- SD 0.0243 cm(2)/day) than in the wet season (Average 0.0022 +/- SD 0.0161 cm(2)/day). Conclusions: The coral growth depended on the presence of herbivores that regulate the growth, reproduction, and survival of algae; currently, this process is being interrupted as a result of overfishing in the reef ecosystems. However, some algae could be beneficial for juvenile corals when their abundance is large enough to protect them from fish predation and small enough not to significantly reduce their growth. These processes are decisive in these ecosystems. particularly in areas where it is relevant from an ecological. social, cultural and economic point of view, which makes these studies important for the correct implementation of integrated management in reef areas helping recovery, protection, and conservation of the reef promoting the decrease of herbivore fishing.","[Tarini Lopez-Jimenez, Ibis; Florez-Leiva, Lenin] Univ Antioquia, Programa Oceanog, Ocean Climate & Enviromnent Res Grp, Antioquia, Colombia; [Irene Quan-Young, Lizette] Univ CES, Fac Ciencias & Biotecnol, Grp Biol CES, Medellin, Colombia","Lopez-Jimenez, IT (corresponding author), Univ Antioquia, Programa Oceanog, Ocean Climate & Enviromnent Res Grp, Antioquia, Colombia.",itlopezj@gmail.com; lennin.fl@gmail.com; lquan@ces.edu.co,,,,,,83,1,1,3,15,REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL,SAN JOSE,"UNIVERSIDAD DE COSTA RICA CIUDAD UNIVERSITARIA, SAN JOSE, 00000, COSTA RICA",0034-7744,2215-2075,,REV BIOL TROP,Rev.

The predatory capacity of female was the highest, followed by male, while that of the larvae was the lowest.

These priority effects are likely to be affected by climate warming and the rate of intraspecific predation, that is cannibalism. In a laboratory experiment, we examined size-mediated priority effects in larvae of the univoltine damselfly, Lestes sponsa, at two different temperatures (21 and 23 degrees C). We created three size groups of larvae by manipulating hatching time: early hatched with a large size (extra-advanced), intermediate hatched with an intermediate size (advanced) and late hatched with a small size (non-advanced). Thereafter, we reared the larvae from these groups in non-mixed and mixed groups of 12 larvae. We found strong priority and temperature effects. First, extra-advanced larvae most often had higher survival, growth and development rates than non-advanced larvae in mixed groups, compared to groups that consisted of only extra-advanced larvae. Second, temperature increased growth and development rates and cannibalism. However, the strength of priority effects did not differ between the two experimental temperatures, because there was no statistical interaction between temperature and treatments. That is, the mixed and non-mixed groups of non-advanced, advanced and extra-advanced larvae showed the same relative change in life-history traits across the two temperatures. Non-advanced and advanced larvae had similar or higher growth rate and mass in mixed groups compared to non-mixed groups, suggesting that predation from advanced larvae in the mixed group released resources for the non-advanced and advanced larvae that survived despite cannibalism risk. Thus, a thinning effect occurred due to cannibalism caused by priority effects. The results suggest that a shift in the relative arrival of offspring can cause temperature-dependent priority effects, mediated through cannibalism, growth and development, which may change the size distribution and abundance of emerging aquatic insects.","[Sniegula, Szymon; Golab, Maria J.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nat Conservat, Dept Ecosyst Conservat, Krakow, Poland; [Johansson, Frank] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, Uppsala, Sweden","Sniegula, S; Golab, MJ (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nat Conservat, Dept Ecosyst Conservat, Krakow, Poland.",szymon.sniegula@gmail.com; marysiagolab@gmail.com,"; , Szymon/E-9588-2015","Golab, Maria J/0000-0001-8796-7473; , Szymon/0000-0003-1459-3751","Institute of Nature Conservation, Polish Academy of Sciences; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission; VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council; Narodowe Centrum NaukiNational Science Centre, Poland [2015/16/T/NZ8/00392, UMO-2017/25/B/NZ8/01852]","Institute of Nature Conservation, Polish Academy of Sciences; Swedish Research Council; Vetenskapsradet; Narodowe Centrum Nauki, Grant/Award Number: 2015/16/T/NZ8/00392 and UMO-2017/25/B/NZ8/01852",,82,8,8,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We studied klipspringer habitat use in Augrabies Falls National Park, South Africa using giving-up densities (GUDs; the amount of food remaining in a resource patch following exploitation) in experimental food patches. We tested hypotheses related to how salient habitat variables might influence klipspringers' perceptions of foraging costs. At small spatial scales (3-4 m), klipspringer GUDs did not vary with cover and open microhabitats, or with the four cardinal aspects (shading) around shrubs. Adding water adjacent to food patches did not influence GUDs, showing that water is not a limiting complementary resource to food. Generally, klipspringers do not appear to be physiologically constrained. There was no difference in GUDs between four daily time periods, or between summer and winter; however, a significant interaction effect of time-of-day with season resulted from GUDs during the midday time period in winter being significantly higher (perceived value lower) than during the same time period in summer. At moderate spatial scales (10-60 m), klipspringer GUDs increased with distance from rocks because of increased predation risk. Based on GUDs collected at the largest scale (two 4.41-ha grids), klipspringers preferred foraging at greater distances from drainage lines and on pebble and cobble substrates. Overall, this study has shown the efficacy of measuring GUDs to determine klipspringers' habitat utilization while foraging.","[Druce, Dave J.; Mackey, Robin L.; Slotow, Rob] Univ KwaZulu Natal, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa; [Brown, Joel S.] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL USA; [Kerley, Graham I.

Usually, a larger propagule size is favored when young are exposed to high mortality risk or conspecific competition. Here we test 2 predictions on how egg size should vary with these selective agents. When offspring are cared for by parents and/or alloparents, protection may reduce the predation risk to young, which may allow mothers to invest less per single offspring. In the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher, brood care helpers protect group offspring and reduce the latters' mortality rate. Therefore, females are expected to reduce their investment per egg when more helpers are present. In a first experiment, we tested this prediction by manipulating the helper number. In N. pulcher, helpers compete for dispersal opportunities with similar-sized individuals of neighboring groups. If the expected future competition pressure on young is high, females should increase their investment per offspring to give them a head start. In a second experiment, we tested whether females produce larger eggs when perceived neighbor density is high. Females indeed reduced egg size with increasing helper number. However, we did not detect an effect of local density on egg size, although females took longer to produce the next clutch when local density was high. We argue that females can use the energy saved by adjusting egg size to reduced predation risk to enhance future reproductive output. Adaptive adjustment of offspring size to helper number may be an important, as yet unrecognized, strategy of cooperative breeders.","Univ Bern, Inst Zool, CH-3032 Hinterkappelen, Switzerland; Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Evolut & Ecol Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria","Taborsky, B (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Zool, Wohlenstr 50A, CH-3032 Hinterkappelen, Switzerland.",barbara.taborsky@esh.unibe.ch,,"Taborsky, Barbara/0000-0003-1690-8155",,,,52,67,67,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Beetle density, particularly in the first-instar stage of the larvae, became extremely low in the second generation in the pond, even though food resources were abundant. The biological check method, which excludes natural enemies by caging, suggested that a causal factor of the low density was predation by Gerris nepalensis in midsummer and thereafter. Normally growing rosettes extend their leaves horizontally on the water surface. However, some rosettes of T japonica grew leaves vertically in the later seasons, and such overgrown rosettes were distributed patchily in the ponds. Beetle density was higher on the latter rosettes than on the former ones. The indoor experiment showed that the water strider can feed on the eggs of beetles on normally grown rosettes but not on the overgrown rosettes. Furthermore, female adults of Galerucella nipponensis preferred the overgrown rosettes over the normally grown rosettes for oviposition when water striders were present. These facts suggest that the spatial structure-mediated indirect effects of the host plant modify the interaction between herbivore and predator.","Okayama Univ, Fac Agr, Okayama 7008530, Japan","Ikeda, K (corresponding author), Okayama Univ, Fac Agr, Okayama 7008530, Japan.",,,,,,,33,9,11,0,8,SPRINGER-VERLAG TOKYO,TOKYO,"3-3-13, HONGO, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0033, JAPAN",1438-3896,,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

In some estuaries, S. quoianum achieve high densities, accelerate shoreline erosion, and damage maritime structures. To determine the distribution, habitat use, and prevalence of this destructive bioeroder within the intertidal zone of Coos Bay, Oregon, a series of field surveys was conducted. Intertidal substrata at 373 haphazardly selected sites throughout the estuary were examined for the presence of S. quoianum and their burrows. Four intertidal substrata were suitable for S. quoianum burrowing: marsh banks, wood, friable rock, and Styrofoam. Isopods were found more frequently at sites with wood than sites with other substrata. Sphaeroma quoianum and burrows were present at approximately 50% and 76% of respective sites containing a substratum suitable for burrowing. Significantly more isopods and burrows were encountered in mesohaline (>5-18) and polyhaline (>18-30) salinities than euhaline (>30) or oligohaline salinities (0.5-5). Low salinity is likely the primary factor limiting isopod populations in the upper estuary. However, the factor(s) limiting lower estuarine distributions are unclear. Factors typically limiting intertidal organisms (salinity, water temperature, dispersal, substrata availability/quality, predation, and competition) do not adequately explain the absence of S. quoianum in the lower estuary.","[Davidson, Timothy M.] Univ Oregon, Oregon Inst Marine Biol, Charleston, OR 97420 USA","Davidson, TM (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Aquat Bioinvas Res & Policy Inst, Environm Sci & Resources Dept, POB 751, Portland, OR 97207 USA.",tid@pdx.edu,,,,,,31,12,12,0,10,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0011-216X,1568-5403,,CRUSTACEANA,Crustaceana,FEB,2008,81,2,,,,,155,167,,10.1163/156854008783476189,,,13,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,269CT,WOS:000253627800003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Furthermore, various ecological factors seem to be related to locomotion characteristics, such as foraging strategy. migration trends. response to predators and competitors. and environmental stress. Objective: To analyze locomotion and the influence of body symmetry in the crawling and righting movements of the sea star Asterina stellifera. Methods: We carried out laboratory experiments in aquariums in the presence/absence of water current and on a horizontal and vertical surface. Results: The speed is similar to speed in other species of similar size. Both the speed and linearity of displacement were independent of individual body size. A water current leads to faster crawling and straight paths, but there is no rheotaxis: streams do not affect locomotion. Speed and linearity of displacement were independent of individual body size. The displacement pattern described here may be an adaptation of organisms that present dense populations in communities with high prey abundance, as is the case of A. stellifera. Conclusions: Like other asteroids, this species did not show an Anterior/Posterior plane of symmetry during locomotion, or righting movement: it does not tend to bilaterality.","[Meretta, Pablo E.] Univ Nacl Mar del Plata, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn Argentina, Inst Invest Marinas & Costeras, Estn Costera JJ Nagera, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Rezende Ventura, Carlos Renato] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Museu Nacl, Lab Echinodermata, Dept Invertebrados, Quinta Boa Vista S-N Sao Cristovao, BR-20940040 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil","Meretta, PE (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Mar del Plata, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn Argentina, Inst Invest Marinas & Costeras, Estn Costera JJ Nagera, Mar Del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",pabloemeretta@gmail.com; ventura@acd.ufrj.br,,,CONICET -Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y TecnicasConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Fundacao Carlos Chagas de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ),"We are grateful to Mar del Plata Aquarium for allowing us to use their facilities for aquariums experimentation with their flow through seawater system.

The mechanisms behind behavioural diversification have only been partly understood, but density-dependent resource availability may play a crucial role. To explore the potential coexistence of different behavioural types within a natural fish population, we conducted a radio telemetry study, measuring habitat use and swimming activity patterns of pike (Esox lucius), a sit-and-wait predatory fish. Three behavioural types co-occurred in the study lake. While two types of fish only selected vegetated littoral habitats, the third type opportunistically used all habitats and increased its pelagic occurrence in response to decreasing resource biomasses. There were no differences in size, age or lifetime growth between the three behavioural types. However, habitat-opportunistic pike were substantially more active than the other two behavioural types, which is energetically costly. The identical growth rates exhibited by all behavioural types indicate that these higher activity costs of opportunistic behaviour were compensated for by increased prey consumption in the less favourable pelagic habitat resulting in approximately equal fitness of all pike groups. We conclude that behavioural diversification in habitat use and activity reduces intraspecific competition in preferred littoral habitats. This may facilitate the emergence of an ideal free distribution of pike along resource gradients.","[Kobler, Alexander] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Kobler, Alexander; Klefoth, Thomas; Mehner, Thomas; Arlinghaus, Robert] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Arlinghaus, Robert] Humboldt Univ, Fac Agr & Hort, Inst Anim Sci, Inland Fisheries Management Lab, D-10115 Berlin, Germany","Kobler, A (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Campus Drie Eiken,Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",alexander.kobler@ua.ac.be,"Arlinghaus, Robert/J-6171-2019; Arlinghaus, Robert/E-3340-2010; Mehner, Thomas/B-8665-2008","Arlinghaus, Robert/0000-0003-2861-527X; Mehner, Thomas/0000-0002-3619-165X; Klefoth, Thomas/0000-0003-3659-5336","R+D project Inland Fisheries Management at the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology; Inland Fisheries; Leibniz Community; Ministry for Rural Development, Environment and Consumer Protection; Brandenburg","We thank Alexander Turck, Michael Fritsch, Dieter Opitz, Christian Helms, Thomas Hintze, Christian Wolter, Frank Fredrich, Volker Huckstorf and Christian Lewin for technical assistance, experimental set up and helpful discussions.

The purpose of our study was to examine the effects of post-metamorphic green frogs (Rana clamitans) on post-metamorphic American toads (Bufo americanus) in the terrestrial environment as a model for understanding how interspecific differences in size at metamorphosis may influence terrestrial interactions. We examined if caged, uncaged or no green frogs affected survival, growth and hiding behavior of recently metamorphosed American toads in a replicated laboratory experiment. Green frogs did not appear to prey upon small American toads. However, by the end of the experiment American toad survival was lowest in treatments with uncaged green frogs; this result suggests that green frogs may outcompete American toads for food, but such impacts in nature may be limited or may have selected for spatial segregation in the terrestrial environment. Green frogs also increased hiding activity of toads at sonic times, which may in part explain the trend of reduced mass gained when toads were reared with green frogs. Thus study represents one of the first to examine interspecific interactions among anurans with complex life cycles in the terrestrial environment.","[Sams, Erin; Boone, Michelle D.] Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Boone, MD (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Zool, 212 Pearson Hall, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",boonemd@muohio.edu,,,Miami University,"We thank M.

The lycaenid butterfly Hemiargus isola associates facultatively with the ant species Formica perpilosa in arid areas of south-western North America. Ants solicit liquid food rewards from butterfly larvae as larvae feed on the host plant, Acacia constricta. Previous studies have shown that tending by F. perpilosa enhances larval growth and pupal survivorship. 2. The effects of ants and plant water content on oviposition behaviour and survivorship to the last larval instar were tested by excluding ants and supplementing water to host plants in a two-way factorial experiment. 3. Butterflies, which lay eggs singly on host plant inflorescences, laid significantly higher egg numbers and densities (eggs/inflorescence) on plants with ants than on plants without ants. This is the first report of a facultative, generalized ant-associate using ants as oviposition cues. Water supplements increased the number, but not the density, of eggs laid on plants. Therefore, it appears that egg-laying butterflies responded to number of inflorescences, rather than plant tissue water per se. 4. Plants with ants had significantly greater numbers of inflorescences during the experiment than plants without ants. Water supplements increased number of inflorescences slightly, but not significantly. 5. Ants increased larval survivorship. Twice as many fourth-instar larvae survived per egg laid on plants with ants than on plants without ants. Ants did not reduce the number of predators present on acacias, but may have reduced predator effectiveness. Ants also did not reduce the numbers of potential H. isola competitors present. 6. Wafer supplementation affected neither the survivorship of H. isola larvae, nor the intensity of ant tending. Water supplementation did not affect the abundance of predators on plants, but did increase the abundance of several herbivorous insect taxa.","PRINCETON UNIV,DEPT ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,PRINCETON,NJ 08544",,,,,,,,42,38,39,0,10,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0NE",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Large females are often more fecund and carry larger eggs (which result in higher number and better quality of offspring), whereas large males usually have more conspicuous ornaments and are better at defending resources. However, intrasexual competition can constrain the access to larger partners, especially when opportunities for mate takeover abound. Here we investigate the relationship between individual's size and mate choice in relation to one's own size and their respective mate's size using the sailfin tetra, a sexually dimorphic Amazonian fish species. We show that ornaments of larger males are exponentially more conspicuous, and larger females are more fecund and carry larger eggs. Contrary to expectation, neither males nor females associated for longer with the larger of two offered potential mates. Instead, individuals of both genders chose opposite-sex individuals of similar sizes to themselves. Additionally, similar-sized pairs were more likely to spawn than couples with higher size asymmetries. Grounded on field observations, we propose that prudent choice should be particularly important in this system, since courtship is long (often taking several days), which offers opportunities for mate takeover. Intrasexual competition, however, cannot readily explain female choice for similar-sized males. We thus suggest that such preference might be best explained by avoidance of filial cannibalism.","[Borghezan, Elio de Almeida; Pinto, Kalebe da Silva; Zuanon, Jansen; da Silva Pires, Tiago Henrique] Inst Nacl de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Lab Ecol Comportamental & Evolucao, Av Andre Araujo, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Borghezan, Elio de Almeida] Kyoto Univ, Wildlife Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto, Japan","Borghezan, ED (corresponding author), Inst Nacl de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Lab Ecol Comportamental & Evolucao, Av Andre Araujo, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.; Borghezan, ED (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Wildlife Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto, Japan.",borghezan.ea@gmail.com,"Zuanon, Jansen A.

Using the wood frog, this hypothesis was tested by determining whether offspring of non-synchronized breeders were more vulnerable to cannibalism than offspring of synchronized breeders. In a laboratory experiment, small tadpoles of similar size did not cannibalize each other. However, large tadpoles preyed heavily on the eggs and hatchlings of conspecifics, and the incidence of predation increased with cannibal size. In natural populations, over 80% of adults bred explosively during a 3-day period, and their offspring were not cannibalized because hatching was synchronized and tadpoles varied only slightly in size. About 5% of adults oviposited late in the breeding season, and the resulting embryos hatched when tadpoles of synchronized breeders averaged 0.6-1.3 g. Larger tadpoles in the ponds cannibalized the eggs and hatchlings of these late breeders. In a field experiment conducted at a natural breeding site, eggs that were added 7 days after embryos of late breeders hatched suffered complete mortality within 19 h. Similarly, more than 50% of hatchlings were cannibalized within 15 min after they were placed in the pond. These results are consistent with the view that synchronized breeding is an adaptation that reduces cannibalism in anurans that breed in temporary ponds.

Ecological release often manifests as increased niche breadth and trait variation, as individuals have the opportunity to exploit a wider variety of resources. At the recently-colonized White Sands dune formation in New Mexico, lizards from white sand habitat have fewer predators and competitors than their dark soil counterparts, and show evidence of ecological release compared to dark soil lizards. To determine whether the dynamics of ecological release also play out over an even finer habitat gradient, we studied southwestern fence lizards in the center of the White Sands dune formation and the narrow ecotone between White Sands and the surrounding dark soil habitats. We predicted that lizards from the central dunes would exhibit ecological release in terms of broadened resource use compared to lizards from the ecotone. We first conducted avian surveys in both the central dunes and ecotone habitats to measure abundance, richness and diversity of avian species that could act as lizard predators. Next, we measured microhabitat-scale resource use by comparing perch selection of lizards in both habitats. Finally, we measured landscape-scale resource use by quantifying home range sizes and daily distances traveled by lizards in both habitats. We found that central dunes lizards used a greater diversity of perch types, and had greater variation in both home range size and daily distances traveled, than ecotone lizards. There were fewer predatory bird species in the central dunes than on the ecotone, and there was a tendency for fewer predation events in the central dunes than on the ecotone. Our results demonstrate that ecological release is detectable over a fine habitat gradient, such as between the center of a recently-colonized habitat and its ecotone with the surrounding ecosystem.","[Refsnider, Jeanine M.; Roches, Simone Des; Rosenblum, Erica Bree] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Refsnider, JM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",refsnider@berkeley.edu,,,National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1202725]; National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada Postgraduate Scholarship; National Science CAREER grant [DEB-1054062],"This study was funded by a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to JMR (no. 1202725), a National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada Postgraduate Scholarship to SD, and a National Science CAREER grant to EBR (DEB-1054062).

Here, we assess the effects of generalist natural enemies on the control of two major pest species in sweet pepper: the green peach aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and the western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande). In greenhouses, two commonly used specialist natural enemies of aphids, the parasitoid Aphidius colemani Viereck and the predatory midge Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani), were released together with either Neoseiulus cucumeris Oudemans, a predator of thrips and a hyperpredator of A. aphidimyza, or Orius majusculus (Reuter), a predator of thrips and aphids and intraguild predator of both specialist natural enemies. The combined use of O. majusculus, predatory midges and parasitoids clearly enhanced the suppression of aphids and consequently decreased the number of honeydew-contaminated fruits. Although intraguild predation by O. majusculus on predatory midges and parasitoids will have affected control of aphids negatively, this was apparently offset by the consumption of aphids by O. majusculus. In contrast, the hyperpredator N. cucumeris does not prey upon aphids, but seemed to release aphids from control by consuming eggs of the midge. Both N. cucumeris and O. majusculus did not affect rates of aphid parasitism by A. colemani. Thrips were also controlled effectively by O. majusculus. A laboratory experiment showed that adult predatory bugs feed on thrips as well as aphids and have no clear preference. Thus, the presence of thrips probably promoted the establishment of the predatory bugs and thereby the control of aphids. Our study shows that intraguild predation, which is potentially negative for biological control, may be more than compensated by positive effects of generalist predators, such as the control of multiple pests, and the establishment of natural enemies prior to pest invasions. Future work on biological control should focus on the impact of species interactions in communities of herbivorous arthropods and their enemies.","[Messelink, Gerben J.; Bloemhard, Chantal M.

Testing multiple hypotheses about sleeping site selection permits examination of the relative strength of distinct ecological factors and expands our ability to understand how selection pressures influence primate sleeping behavior. Here we examine how avoidance of biting insects, thermoregulation, foraging efficiency, tree stability, and interspecific competition influence selection of sleeping sites by proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus) in Indonesian Borneo. We collected data on relative insect abundance, temperature, rainfall, food availability, group size, sleeping site location, and presence of other primates for 12 mo. Using formal model comparison and information criteria, we analyzed the relative importance of these ecological factors in determining one aspect of sleeping site location: distance from the river. Our models supported the avoidance of biting insects and the foraging efficiency hypotheses. Proboscis monkeys slept further inland on nights when the abundance of sandflies was high along the river, and when less food was available along the river. Many studies suggest that primates select sleeping trees and locations to reduce predation risk; our study indicates that additional factors may also be important in determining sleeping site selection.","[Feilen, Katie L.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Feilen, Katie L.] Disneys Anim Programs, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830 USA; [Marshall, Andrew J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Anthropol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Marshall, Andrew J.] Univ Michigan, Program Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Marshall, Andrew J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Feilen, KL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Feilen, KL (corresponding author), Disneys Anim Programs, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830 USA.",katie.l.feilen@disney.com,,,"U.S. Fulbright Student Fellowship; Boren Fellowship; University of CaliforniaUniversity of California System; Davis Department of Anthropology; Primate Conservation, Inc.","We thank the Indonesian government, the State Ministry of Research and Technology (RISTEK), and the mayor of Sungai Tolak for giving us permission to conduct this research.

Anthocorid species (Hemiptera) are important natural enemies of thrips. Several experiments were undertaken to determine whether a thrips lure, methyl isonicotinate (MI), affected the behaviour of WFT and anthocorids found in outdoor crops. Currently, this volatile compound is used in conjunction with sticky traps for monitoring thrips predominantly in greenhouses in Northern Europe. In the present study, in a nectarine [Prunus persica (L.) (Rosaceae)] orchard and an outdoor capsicum [Capsicum annuum L. (Solanaceae)] crop in Spain, blue sticky and white water traps with MI caught significantly more WFT than traps without MI. The volatile compound also significantly increased both blue sticky and white water trap capture of anthocorids - predominantly Orius laevigatus (Fieber) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) - in the capsicum crop. These results indicate that the behaviour of both WFT and O.laevigatus were altered by the presence of the compound and suggest there is potential to develop novel tools based on MI in conjunction with biological control strategies for thrips management.","[Davidson, M.

In the marine environment, the detection of ecotones is complex given the highly dynamic nature of marine systems and the paucity of empirical data over ocean-basin scales. One approach to overcome these limitations is to use stable isotopes from animal tissues since they can track spatial oceanographic variability across marine systems and, in turn, can be used as ecological tracers. Here, we analysed stable isotopes of deep-sea fishes to assess the presence of ecological discontinuities across the western Mediterranean. We were specifically interested in exploring the connection between deep-sea biological activity and particular oceanographic features (i.e., surface fronts) occurring in the pelagic domain. We collected samples for three different abundant deep-sea species in May 2004 from an experimental oceanographic trawling cruise (MEDITS): the Mictophydae jewel lanternfish Lampanyctus crocodilus and two species of the Gadidae family, the silvery pout Gadiculus argenteus and the blue whiting Micromesistius poutassou. The experimental survey occurred along the Iberian continental shelf and the upper and middle slopes, from the Strait of Gibraltar in the SW to the Cape Creus in the NE. The three deep-sea species were highly abundant throughout the study area and they showed geographic variation in their isotopic values, with decreasing values from north to south disrupted by an important change point around the Vera Gulf. Isotopic latitudinal gradients were explained by pelagic oceanographic conditions along the study area and confirm the existence of an ecotone at the Vera Gulf. This area could be considered as an oceanographic boundary where waters of Atlantic origin meet Mediterranean surface waters forming important frontal structures such as the Almeria-Oran front. In fact, our results relate geographical variation in stable isotopes of deep-sea fishes to regional changes in surface oceanography, highlighting the importance of mesoscale oceanographic features.","[Louzao, Maite] CSIC UIB, IMEDEA, Inst Mediterrani Estudis Avancats, C Miquel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Mallorca, Spain; [Louzao, Maite] AZTI, Pasaia 20110, Gipuzkoa, Spain; [Navarro, Joan; Forero, Manuela G.] CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Estn Biol Donana, Av Americo Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Navarro, Joan] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut,UMR 5175,EPHE, Montpellier, France; [Delgado-Huertas, Antonio] CSIC, Inst Andaluz Ciencias Tierra, Granada 18100, Spain; [Gil de Sola, Luis] IEO, Ctr Oceanog Fuengirola, Malaga 29640, Spain","Louzao, M (corresponding author), AZTI, Pasaia 20110, Gipuzkoa, Spain.",maite.louzao@gmail.com,"Navarro, Joan/C-2119-2009; Huertas, Antonio Delgado/F-6866-2011; Louzao, Maite/N-5379-2014; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob/AAB-1161-2019; de Sola, Luis Gil/ABE-6143-2020; de Sola Simarro, Luis Gil/F-6281-2019","Navarro, Joan/0000-0002-5756-9543; Huertas, Antonio Delgado/0000-0002-7240-1570; de Sola, Luis Gil/0000-0003-1987-9716; de Sola Simarro, Luis Gil/0000-0003-1987-9716; Louzao, Maite/0000-0002-9997-5144","Spanish GovernmentSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [P06-RNM-02362, REN2002-00450, BOS2003-01960, CGL2006-04325/BOS]; Balearic Government [FPI02-72474662Y]; Ramon y CajalSpanish Government [RYC-2012-09897]; Andalucia Talent Hub Program [291780]; European Union's Seventh Framework ProgramEuropean Commission; Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions; Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiviness; Enploymnet of the Junta de Andalucia, SpainJunta de Andalucia; Marine Research Division (AZTI) [796]","Fish samples were collected within the frame of the MEDITS project, with the help of Pere Abello and the scientists and crew at R/V Cornide de Saavedra (Spanish Institute of Oceanography, IEO).

Intraspecific genetic diversity, measured as the number of genotypes, can enhance plant primary productivity and have cascading effects at higher trophic levels, such as an increase in herbivore and predator richness. The positive effects of genotypic mixtures are not only determined by additive effects, but also by interactions among genotypes, such as facilitation or inhibition. However, so far there has been no effort to predict the extent of such effects. In this study, we address the question of whether the magnitude of the effect of genotype number on population performance can be explained by the extent of dissimilarity in key traits among genotypes in a mixture. We examine the relative contribution of genotype number and phenotypic dissimilarity among genotypes to population performance of the soil arthropod, Orchesella cincta. Nearly homogeneous genotypes were created from inbred isofemale lines. Phenotypic dissimilarity among genotypes was assessed in terms of three life-history traits that are associated with population growth rate, i.e., egg size, egg development time, and juvenile growth rate. A microcosm experiment with genotype mixtures consisting of one, two, four, and eight genotypes, showed that genotypic richness strongly increased population size and biomass production and was associated with greater net diversity effects. Most importantly, there was a positive log-linear relationship between phenotypic dissimilarity in a mixture and the net diversity effects for juvenile population size and total biomass. In other words, the degree of phenotypic dissimilarity among genotypes determined the magnitude of the genotypic richness effect, although this relationship leveled off at higher values of phenotypic dissimilarity. Although the exact mechanisms responsible for these effects are currently unknown, similar advantages of trait dissimilarity have been found among species. Hence, to better understand population performance, genotype number and phenotypic dissimilarity should be considered collectively.","[Ellers, Jacintha; Rog, Stefanie; Braam, Ciska; Berg, Matty P.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Ecol Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Ellers, J (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Ecol Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jacintha.ellers@falw.vu.nl,"Ellers, Jacintha/K-5823-2012","Ellers, Jacintha/0000-0003-2665-1971; Berg, Matty P./0000-0001-8442-8503; Rog, Stefanie/0000-0002-4034-7944",Netherlands Organization of Scientific ResearchNetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [864.03.003],"We thank Herman Verhoef, Toby Kiers, and two anonymous reviewers for giving helpful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

If native large carnivores perceive dogs as threatening, impacts could extend to the community level by altering interactions between large carnivores and their prey. Dog impacts may be further exacerbated if these human-associated predators are also perceived as indicators of risk from humans. However, observational approaches used to date have led to ambiguity regarding the effects of dog presence on wildlife. We experimentally quantified dog impacts on the behavior of a native large carnivore, presenting playbacks of dog vocalizations to pumas in central California. We show that the perceived presence of dogs has minimal impacts on puma behavior at their kill sites, and is no more likely to affect total feeding time at kills than non-threatening controls. We previously demonstrated that pumas exhibit strong responses to human cues, and here show that perceived risk from human presence far exceeds that from dogs.

The efficacy of the two predatory mites appeared to be strongly affected by various factors (grape variety, presence of macropredators, climatic condition, interspecific competition, phytoseiid strain). The phytoseiid mites Amblyseius aberrans (Oud.) and Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten were released at three different density levels in two vineyards (A, B) infested by Eotetranychus carpini (Oud.). One strain of A. aberrans and two strains of T. pyri were used for the experiments. In vineyard A, Panonychus ulmi (Koch) was recorded in the second and subsequent years of the experiments and became dominant over E. carpini from the third year onwards. The presence of anthocorids in the same vineyard increased the complexity of the system and gave us the possibility of comparing two very different situations. Release of low numbers of A. aberrans gave a satisfactory control of spider mite populations in both vineyards. These results were even obtained on a variety non preferred by phytoseiids (Merlot) and with the continuous presence of anthocorids (vineyard A). After 5 years, A. aberrans was observed in 53 % of the plots in vineyard A and in all plots of the other vineyard (B). Results of experiments in which T pyri was released were similar to those obtained in the experiments with A. aberrans, but only in the first year of the study. In vineyard A, the T pyri populations declined dramatically from the second year onwards; the use of a non-preferred variety (Merlot) and the continuous presence of anthocorids seemed the most important factors causing the decline of predatory mite density. In vineyard B, T pyri was capable of controlling spider mites even in the second year of the experiments. A very low density of macropredators and a preferred grape variety (Raboso) positively affected control. The density of T pyri in vineyard B decreased at the end of the second year because of adverse climatic conditions (high temperatures in combination with a low relative humidity). The decrease of T pyri allowed the displacement of this species by A. aberrans in all plots of vineyard B. It was also shown that the two T pyri strains differed in their efficacy to control spider mites.",,"DUSO, C (corresponding author), UNIV PADUA,IST ENTOMOL AGR,VIA GRADENIGO 6,I-35100 PADUA,ITALY.",,"Gomez Moya, Cristina/B-6004-2013; duso, carlo/AAG-8435-2020","Duso, Carlo/0000-0002-2600-2536",,,,0,41,43,0,5,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0168-8162,,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

Environmental factors facilitating early growth and survival of shad plus potential interspecific competition for zooplankton may reduce growth and survival of YOY bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), another common species in reservoirs. We hypothesized that fewer YOY bluegill moving from the limnetic zone to the littoral zone in late spring probably slows or prevents the ontogenetic switch to piscivory by YOY largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), reducing their oversummer growth, overwinter survival, and hence recruitment to their second year. To determine whether shad and bluegill abundances indeed vary inversely in reservoirs, we quantified densities of YOY shad and bluegill in four reservoirs across several years (1987-1994; N = 22 reservoir-years). To assess how YOY bluegill abundance influenced the ontogenetic dietary switch to fish by largemouth bass, we conducted experiments with differing levels of realism and control (4-m(2) littoral cages, 4.5-m(2) outdoor pools, and 0.33-m(2) laboratory aquaria). In reservoirs, peak YOY bluegill density declined weakly in the limnetic zone but strongly in the littoral zone when peak limnetic YOY Dorosoma spp. exceeded 10 individuals/m(3). In pools and aquaria, largemouth bass grew more rapidly at greater than or equal to 3 than at zero bluegill per largemouth bass. Using known temperatures and largemouth bass growth in a bioenergetics model, we discovered that YOY largemouth bass in pools and aquaria ate less than or equal to 65% of their maximum daily consumption potential (in grams of wet mass) at greater than or equal to 6 bluegill per largemouth bass. In cages, largemouth bass consumed only 40% of their maximum and grew less at bluegill abundances similar to those in pools and aquaria, probably because dense vegetation and depletion of bluegill inhibited predatory success. In reservoirs with abundant shad, reduced littoral bluegill density likely compromises first-year growth and recruitment of largemouth bass. However, variable abiotic and biotic factors may modify YOY bluegill abundance and hence invalidate our predictions for largemouth bass recruitment success. To better predict fish community structure and develop management actions for reservoir ecosystems, multi-scale experimentation should be combined with whole-system manipulations (e.g., via adaptive management) to bound these variable interactions.","Ohio State Univ, Aquat Ecol Lab, Dept Zool, Columbus, OH 43212 USA","Garvey, JE (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Aquat Ecol Lab, Dept Zool, 1314 Kinnear Rd, Columbus, OH 43212 USA.",,"Garvey, James/AAO-5698-2021; Garvey, Jim/A-4919-2012","Garvey, Jim/0000-0001-5393-9351",,,,116,42,44,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,1939-5582,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Highlighting examples demonstrated the influence of the government on the occurrence of such an imbalance. The literature review contains analysis of approaches to measure the most productive scientists' age in different fields of knowledge and to construct research labs' age structure models. The optimal S&T personnel age structure in Russia is estimated using the model predator-victim. It is shown that the role of three age groups: young, mature and elderly researchers - in different countries (Russia, France and the UK) is different. To build the model, the hypothesis is formulated that only two age groups are active, and the third plays the role of balancing the staffing segment. Experimental calculations have confirmed this hypothesis. Two scenarios of its formation - demographic (natural inflow and outflow of personnel) and competitive (model reproduction of researchers' interaction) are considered to identify the degree of intensity of the S&T personnel age structure, which set the interval of acceptable values for the actual shares of age groups. It is shown that the problem of shortage of mature researchers is not a typical Russian problem, but to a large extent is typical for developed European countries; the specificity of the Russian model of scientific personnel reproduction, in which all the problems are aggravated, is considered. The issues of choosing an adequate policy to reduce the negative trend in the formation of the age structure of Russian researchers are discussed.","[Balatskiy, Evgeniy V.] Financial Univ, Macroecon Regulat Ctr, Moscow, Russia; [Balatskiy, Evgeniy V.] Russian Acad Sci, Cent Econ Math Inst, Moscow, Russia; [Yurevich, Maksim A.] Financial Univ, Moscow, Russia","Balatskiy, EV (corresponding author), Financial Univ, Macroecon Regulat Ctr, Moscow, Russia.; Balatskiy, EV (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Cent Econ Math Inst, Moscow, Russia.",ebalatsky@inbox.ru; maksjuve@gmail.com,,,,,,15,1,3,0,0,SOUTHERN FEDERAL UNIV,ROSTOV-ON-DON,"OF 211, GORGOKO ST, 88, ROSTOV-ON-DON, 344002, RUSSIA",2073-6606,,,TERRA ECON,Terra Econ.,,2018,16,3,,,,,60,76,,10.23683/2073-6606-2018-16-3-60-76,,,17,Economics,Business & Economics,GV2UT,WOS:000445947500004,,,,,2021-09-27,

For example, fluid velocity and turbulence can alter the impact of predators by limiting their environmental range and altering their foraging ability. We investigated how hydrodynamics affected the foraging behavior of the green crab (Carcinus maenas), which is invading marine habitats throughout the world. High flow velocities are known to reduce green crab predation rates and our study sought to identify the mechanisms by which flow affects green crabs. We performed a series of experiments with green crabs to determine: 1) if their ability to find prey was altered by flow in the field, 2) how flow velocity influenced their foraging efficiency, and 3) how flow velocity affected their handling time of prey. In a field study, we caught significantly fewer crabs in baited traps at sites with fast versus slow flows even though crabs were more abundant in high flow areas. This finding suggests that higher velocity flows impair the ability of green crabs to locate prey. In laboratory flume assays, green crabs foraged less efficiently when flow velocity was increased. Moreover, green crabs required significantly more time to consume prey in high velocity flows. Our data indicate that flow can impose significant chemosensory and physical constraints on green crabs. Hence, hydrodynamics may strongly influence the role that green crabs and other predators play in rocky intertidal communities.","[Robinson, Elizabeth M.; Smee, Delbert L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Life Sci, Corpus Christi, TX USA; [Trussell, Geoffrey C.] Northeastern Univ, Ctr Marine Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USA","Robinson, EM (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Life Sci, Corpus Christi, TX USA.",lee.smee@tamucc.edu,"Smee, Lee/B-4042-2013; Trussell, Geoffrey/AAQ-9165-2020",,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); Texas Research Development Fund; Darling Marine Center,"Funding for this research was provided by NSF to Smee and Trussell, the Texas Research Development Fund to Smee, and a student fellowship from the Darling Marine Center to Robinson.

The intertidal, burrowing amphipod Corophium volutator, can only move rapidly over large distances (10s of m-km) by swimming. An investigation into the swimming behaviour of Corophium on the Ythan estuary, Aberdeenshire, using emergence, settlement and plankton traps indicated that on most high tides very few animals emerge, swim or settle, and that these individuals are mostly adult males. Such swimming is probably related to reproduction, and with such low frequency will have little impact on spatial heterogeneity. However, periodically during the progression from neap to spring tides high numbers of juveniles swim on nocturnal high tides. This is reflected by higher, juvenile dominated, settlement after these periods. This swimming is probably related to dispersal and the survival of juveniles after dispersal will determine the subsequent patterns of heterogeneity at large (km), and potentially also small (m-cm), scales.

Although studies of the bullfrog's effects on invaded communities have been carried out, they have focused mostly on post-metamorphic stages. However, considering the experimental evidence and its ecological attributes, the L. catesbeianus tadpole could also have significant impact on invaded communities. The aim of this study was to perform a detailed qualitative and quantitative exploration of the L. catesbeianus larval diet. Gut content was studied and compared for three invaded locations in Uruguay (Departments of Canelones, Soriano and Cerro Largo). Although microscopic algae (Spirogyra spp., Euglena spp., Closterium spp., Volvox spp. and Scenedesmus spp.) were the most frequent prey, the diet was also made up of small invertebrates (especially rotifers) and eggs. Statistically significant differences in diet richness and prey identity were found among the three study sites, probably due to local conditions. One common feature among the three locations was the ingestion of prey with high protein levels, filamentous algae and animal prey. The high frequency of high-protein prey could explain the substantial growth rate of these larvae. Native tadpoles appear to have a much poorer diet than bullfrogs. We can thus assume that the L. catesbeianus larvae will be a major competitor and a potential predator for native communities. We propose that L. catesbeianus tadpoles may have significant effects on invaded communities, and should be considered in future research and managements plans.","[Ruibal, Mariana] Serv Oceanog Hidrog & Meteorol Armada, Dept Oceanog Fis, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Laufer, Gabriel] Museo Nacl Hist Nat, Area Biodiversidad & Conservac, Montevideo, Uruguay","Ruibal, M (corresponding author), Serv Oceanog Hidrog & Meteorol Armada, Dept Oceanog Fis, Montevideo, Uruguay.",marianarc@gmail.com,"Laufer, Gabriel/B-9775-2017; Laufer, Gabriel/Q-5538-2019","Laufer, Gabriel/0000-0002-8285-5023",Amphibian Specialist Group (UICN) Chester Zoo Seed Grant,"This work is partially supported by the Amphibian Specialist Group (UICN) Chester Zoo Seed Grant to GL.

Despite its promise, the potential of transfer entropy in animal behavior is yet to be fully tested, and a number of technical challenges in information theory and statistics remain open. Here, we examine an alternative approach to the computation of transfer entropy based on symbolic dynamics. In this context, a symbol is associated with a specific locomotory bout across two or more consecutive time instants, such as reversing the swimming direction. Symbols encapsulate salient locomotory patterns and the associated permutation transfer entropy quantifies the ability to predict the patterns of an individual given those of another individual. We demonstrate this framework on an existing dataset on fish, for which we have knowledge of the underlying cause and-effect relationship between the focal subject and the stimulus. Symbolic dynamics offers an intuitive and robust approach to study animal behavior, which could enable the inference of causal relationship from noisy experimental observations of limited duration.

Enemy-free space (EFS) was defined by Jeffries & Lawton (1984) as 'ways of living that reduce or eliminate a species' vulnerability to one or more species of natural enemies'. EFS has emerged in the literature as a significant niche-moulding factor. However, the lack of consistency among the empirical studies as to how EFS should be defined, and what hypotheses should be tested in order to evaluate its relative importance, prompted us to review the literature and to propose a working definition that results in a general set of testable hypotheses. 2. To test the relative importance of EFS in structuring the communities of organisms, we propose a set of three falsifiable null hypotheses that must be tested sequentially and rejected. Ho1: The fitness of the organism in an original habit (e.g. on an original host plant) in the presence of natural enemies is equal to the fitness of the organism in that habit in the absence of natural enemies. Acceptance of the alternative hypothesis that the fitness of the organism in the presence of natural enemies is less than in the absence of natural enemies is necessary to demonstrate the importance of natural enemies. Ho2: The fitness of the organism in an alternative habit with natural enemies is equal to the fitness of the organism in the original habit with natural enemies. Acceptance of the alternative hypothesis that the fitness of the organism in the alternative habit with natural enemies is greater than that in the original habit with natural enemies is necessary to demonstrate that the alternative habit provides EFS. Ho3: The fitness of the organism in an alternative habit without natural enemies equals the fitness of the organism in the original habit without natural enemies. Acceptance of the alternative hypothesis that the fitness of the organism in an alternative habit without natural enemies is less than in the original habit without natural enemies is necessary to demonstrate the relative importance of EFS compared with other co-occurring niche-moulding factors such as competition or host nutritional quality. 3. We searched the literature and evaluated fifty-three references (nineteen references to seventeen different terrestrial systems and thirty-four references to twenty-four different freshwater systems) to test our hypotheses. 4. Of the forty-one systems examined, nineteen (46%) tested only for differences in vulnerability of the prey or host species between EFS and non-EFS options (our Ho2); sixteen (39%) tested for the importance of natural enemies and the effectiveness of the alternative habit in providing EFS (our Ho1 and Ho2); and only ten systems (24%) tested for Ho1, Ho2 and the relative importance of EFS in the system as' measured by fitness (our Ho3). 5. Of the systems that tested for EFS, sixteen of nineteen (84%), thirteen of sixteen (81%) and seven of ten (70%) showed evidence in support of the existence of EFS according to hypothesis Ho2 only, hypotheses Ho1 and Ho2, and our three working hypotheses, respectively. 6. These results indicate that very few studies have actually tested for the existence of EFS. Nevertheless, results from this Limited number of natural systems suggest that EFS may be important in moulding the niches of arthropods. Because of the large number of claims for EFS in systems where none of the basic hypotheses were investigated, we suggest that authors test for EFS experimentally, be judicious in selecting articles to cite in support of EFS, and exert care in attributing it as a selective force in the evolution of arthropods in specific systems.",,"Berdegue, M (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF RIVERSIDE, DEPT ENTOMOL, RIVERSIDE, CA 92521 USA.",,"Hare, J.

In this study, we ask whether the communication and use of information about food availability differ throughout the day. First, we assessed temporal variation in food-related vocal information produced in foraging flocks of tits (Paridae) using audio recordings at radio-frequency identification-equipped feeding stations. Vocal activity was highest in the morning and decreased into the afternoon. This pattern was not explained by there being fewer birds present, as we found that group sizes increased over the course of the day. Next, we experimentally tested the underlying causes for this diurnal calling pattern. We set up bird feeders with or without playback of calls from tits, either in the morning or in the afternoon, and compared latency to feeder discovery, accumulation of flock members, and total number of birds visiting the feeder. Irrespective of time of day, playbacks had a strong effect on all three response measures when compared to silent control trials, demonstrating that tits will readily use vocal information to improve food detection throughout the day. Thus, the diurnal pattern of foraging behaviour did not appear to affect use and production of food-related vocalizations. Instead, we suggest that, as the day progresses and foraging group sizes increase, the costs of producing calls at the food source (e.g. competition and attraction of predators) outweigh the benefits of recruiting group members (i.e. adding individuals to large groups only marginally increases safety in numbers), causing the observed decrease in vocal activity into the afternoon. Our findings imply that individuals make economic social adjustments based on conditions of their social environment when deciding to vocally recruit group members.","[Hillemann, F.; Cole, E.

Many studies have examined the relative growth and survival of transgenic and non-transgenic salmonids, and the results have been highly variable due to genotype x environment interactions. The relative survival of fast- and slow-growing strains can reverse depending on the environment, but it is not clear which specific environmental characteristics are driving these responses. To address this question, two experiments were designed where environmental conditions were varied to investigate the contribution of rearing density, food amount, food type, habitat complexity, and risk of predation on relative growth and survival of fast-growing transgenic and slow-growing wild-type coho salmon. The first experiment altered density (high vs. low) and food amount (high vs. low). Density impacted the relative growth of the genotypes, where transgenic fish grew more than non-transgenic fish in low density streams, regardless of food level. Density also affected survival, with high density causing increased mortality for both genotypes, but the mortality of transgenic relative to non-transgenic fish was lower within the high-density streams, regardless of food level. The second experiment altered habitat complexity (simple vs. complex), food type (artificial vs. natural), amount of food (normal vs. satiation), and risk of predation (present vs. absent). Results from this experiment showed that genotype affected growth and survival, but genotype effects were modulated by one or more environmental factors. The effect of genotype on survival was influenced by all examined environmental factors, such that no predictable trend in relative survival of transgenic versus non-transgenic fry emerged. This was primarily due to variations in survival of non-transgenic fish under different environmental conditions (non-transgenic fry had highest survival in hatchery conditions, and lowest survival in complex conditions with natural food fed at a normal level with or without predators). Transgenic fry survival was only significantly influenced by predator presence. The effects of genotype on mass and length were significantly modulated by food type only. Transgenic fry were able to gain a large size advantage over non-transgenic fish when fed artificial food under all habitat types. These experiments support the observations of dynamic responses in growth and survival depending on the environment, and demonstrate the challenge of applying laboratory-based experiments to risk assessment in nature.","[Vandersteen, Wendy E.; Leggatt, Rosalind; Sundstrom, L.

Dispersal evolution is driven by a trade-off between costs and benefits, which is influenced by interindividual variability and local environmental conditions (context-dependent dispersal). Many studies have investigated how dispersal decisions may be influenced by environmental factors, including density, predation and interspecific competition. Yet few have attempted to examine how habitat disturbance may affect the dispersal process in spatially structured populations. In early successional species, one might expect individuals to adjust their dispersal decisions based on two main factors that potentially have an influence on reproductive success: patch size and the level of patch disturbance. In this study, we examined how these two factors affect breeding success and dispersal decisions in an early successional amphibian, the yellow-bellied toad, Bombina variegata. To this end, we used capture-recapture data collected on a spatially structured population occupying 28 breeding patches. We took advantage of recent developments in multievent capture-recapture models to detect signs of context-dependent dispersal. The results revealed that the probability of successful reproduction and the number of newly metamorphosed individuals increased with both the size and the proportion of disturbance of a patch. In addition, our results showed that the factors affecting breeding success also influenced breeding dispersal probability. Large patch size negatively influenced emigration probability; in contrast, it positively influenced immigration probability. Equally, higher disturbance had a strong negative influence on emigration probability and slightly positively affected immigration probability. These findings strongly suggest that individuals make context-dependent dispersal decisions, adjusted to maximize future fitness prospects in a patch, allowing them to better cope with rapid changes in environmental conditions resulting from the ecological succession process. This opens new areas of potential research into the role of dispersal in organism specialization along an ecological succession gradient. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Recent work has questioned the robustness of traditional indicators, particularly at seawater bathing beaches. For example, a study of Florida beaches found unexpectedly high abundances of Escherichia coli, fecal coliforms, and enterococci in beach sand. The aim of the present study was to explain these abundances by assessing the survival of E coli and enterococci in beach sand relative to seawater. We used a combination of quantitative laboratory mesocosm experiments and field observations. Results suggested that E coli and enteroccocci exhibited increased survivability and growth in sand relative to seawater. Because fecal bacteria are capable of replicating in sand, at least under controlled laboratory conditions, the results suggest that sand may be an important reservoir of metabolically active fecal organisms. Experiments with natural mesocosms (i.e., unsterilized sand or water rich in micropredators and native bacteria) failed to show the same increases in fecal indicators as was found in sterile sand. It is postulated that this was due to predation and competition with indigenous bacteria in these natural systems. Nonetheless, high populations of indicators were maintained and recovered from sand over the duration of the experiment as opposed to the die-off noted in water. Indicator bacteria may wash out of sand into shoreline waters during weather and tidal events, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of these indicators as predictors of health risk and complicating the interpretations for water quality managers.","[Rogerson, A.] Calif State Univ Fresno, Coll Sci & Math, Fresno, CA 93740 USA; [Hartz, A.; Cuvelier, M.; Nowosielski, K.; Green, M.; McCorquodale, D.

In this paper we critically review the evidence for the several hypotheses. Empirical support is strongest for the three food hypotheses and for those addressing depth, competition, and the colonization cycle. The hypotheses are not independent because the capture of seston is dependent on certain environmental factors and the use of filtering sites. Certain species appear to be outlet specialists. More experimental tests of the hypotheses would not only clarify the population ecology of take-outlet filter feeders but also allow predictions to be made about food limitation and disturbance effects on the species assemblage.

Results demonstrated that in two-way choice tests, air-streams emanating from live Fagopyrum esculentum Moench (buckwheat) flowers were significantly more attractive than clean air to both male and female wasps, by more than one and two orders of magnitude, respectively. When air-streams from flowers presented alone were compared to those from flowers presented with E. balteatus, or exposed to E. balteatus prior to use, no preferences were detected. Nevertheless, air that had passed through chambers containing only live E. balteatus was significantly repellent to female wasps, with individuals spending 18 times less in these air-streams than clean air. Conversely, air passed over E. balteatus was attractive to male A. ervi, with wasps spending more than six times longer in this vs. clean air. We argue that hoverfly floral visitation/use should have minimal impact on floral attractiveness to A. ervi based on these results, and that for male wasps greater benefits might be gained by responding positively to hoverfly volatiles in the absence of floral cues. In a separate experiment, a consistent trend for reduced fitness of female A. ervi on caged F. esculentum was observed under increasing competitive pressure from E. balteatus. High densities of hoverflies significantly reduced wasp longevity by more than 25%, though lower densities had no significant effect. Conversely, male A. ervi appeared to survive for longer where higher densities of hoverflies were present, though results were not as clear-cut statistically. We argue that antagonistic interactions seen between hoverflies and female A. ervi were the result of behavioural interference and would only be observed in the field under conditions of extreme competitive pressure.

Pelagic cnidarians and ctenophores (jellies) have been the focus of my career. I think my work has been relevant to the broader scientific community because jellies are predators and potential competitors of fish. In my early research, I quantitatively estimated the predation effects of jellies on zooplankton and ichthyoplankton. I found that most jellies are selective predators, with a few species having diets of only fish larvae or soft-bodied prey. As I learned more about the physical environment that jellies encounter, my early reductionist approach evolved into a more holistic approach. I thought the asexual multiplication from the attached polyp stage would be fundamental in determining jellyfish population size and that the effects of environmental variables could be tested experimentally. It also seemed that humans have changed the natural environment in ways favoring jellies over fish and jelly populations may have increased in developed, eutrophic, hypoxic, overfished, and warming coastal waters.

The recent sea star die-off throughout the eastern Pacific, known as Sea Star Wasting Disease, has prompted a need to understand spatial and temporal patterns of sea star assemblages and the environmental variables that structure these assemblages. We examined spatial and temporal patterns in sea star assemblages (composition and density) across regions in the northern Gulf of Alaska and assessed the role of seven static environmental variables (distance to freshwater inputs, tidewater glacial presence, exposure to wave action, fetch, beach slope, substrate composition, and tidal range) in influencing sea star assemblage structure before and after sea star declines. Environmental variables correlated with sea star distribution can serve as proxies to environmental stressors, such as desiccation, attachment, and wave action. Intertidal sea star surveys were conducted annually from 2005 to 2018 at five sites in each of four regions that were between 100 and 420 km apart across the northern Gulf of Alaska. In the pre-disease years, assemblages were different among regions, correlated mostly to tidewater glacier presence, fetch, and tidal range. The assemblages after wasting disease were different from those before the event with lower diversity and lower density. In addition to these declines, the disease manifested itself at different times across the northern Gulf of Alaska and did not impact all species uniformly across sites. Post sea star wasting, there was a shift in the environmental variables that correlated with sea star structure, resulting in sea star assemblages being highly correlated with slope, fetch, and tidal range. In essence, sea star wasting disease resulted in a shift in the sea star assemblage that is now correlating with a slightly different combination of environmental variables. Understanding the delicate interplay of environmental variables that influence sea star assemblages could expand knowledge of the habitat preferences and tolerance ranges of important and relatively unstudied species within the northern Gulf of Alaska.","[Konar, Brenda; Mitchell, Timothy James; Iken, Katrin; Weitzman, Benjamin] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, POB 757220, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA; [Coletti, Heather] Natl Pk Serv, Inventory & Monitoring Program, Southwest Alaska Network, 4175 Geist Rd, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA; [Dean, Thomas] Coastal Resource Associates, 5190 El Arbol Dr, Carlsbad, CA 92008 USA; [Esler, Daniel; Weitzman, Benjamin] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, 4210 Univ Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Lindeberg, Mandy] NOAA Fisheries, AFSC, AFSC Auke Bay Labs, 17109 Pt Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Pister, Benjamin] Natl Pk Serv, Kenai Fjords Natl Pk,411 Washington St, Seward, AK 99664 USA","Konar, B (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, POB 757220, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA.",bhkonar@alaska.edu,,"Weitzman, Benjamin/0000-0001-7559-3654",Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee CouncilExxon Mobil Corporation,"We thank all the student and other volunteers who assisted with the field work associated with this project.

This is crucial in developing appropriate management strategies for their conservation and mitigating human-carnivore conflict. Current models on optimal foraging suggest that mammalian carnivores would profit most from killing the largest prey that they can subdue with minimal risk of injury to themselves. Wild carnivore diets are primarily estimated through analysis of their scats. Using extensive feeding experiments (n=68) on a wide size range (45-130kg) of obligate carnivores - lion, leopard, jungle cat and domestic cat, we parameterize biomass models that best relate consumption to scat production. We evaluate additional constraints of gut fill, prey digestibility and carcass utilization on carnivory that were hereto not considered in optimal foraging studies. Our results show that patterns of consumption to scat production against prey size are similar and asymptotic, contrary to established linear models, across these carnivores after accounting for the effect of carnivore size. This asymptotic, allometric relationship allowed us to develop a generalized model: biomass consumed per collectable scat/predator weight=0033-0025exp(-4284(prey weight/predator weight)), which is applicable to all obligate carnivores to compute prey biomass consumed from scats. Our results also depict a relationship for prey digestibility which saturates at about 90% for prey larger than predator size. Carcass utilization declines exponentially with prey size. These mechanisms result in digestible biomass saturating at prey weights approximately equal to predator weight. Published literature on consumption by tropical carnivores that has relied on linear biomass models is substantially biased. We demonstrate the nature of these biases by correcting diets of tiger, lion and leopard in recent publications. Our analysis suggests that consumption of medium-sized prey was significantly underestimated, while large prey consumption was grossly overestimated in large carnivore diets to date. We highlight that additional constraints of prey digestibility and utilization combined with escalating handling time and risks of killing large prey make prey larger than the predator size unprofitable for obligate carnivores.","[Chakrabarti, Stotra; Jhala, Yadvendradev V.; Dutta, Sutirtha] Wildlife Inst India, Dept Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Qureshi, Qamar] Wildlife Inst India, Dept Landscape Level Planning & Management, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Kadivar, Riaz F.; Rana, Vishwadipsinh J.] Sakkarbaug Zool Pk, Junagadh 362001, Gujarat, India; [Rana, Vishwadipsinh J.] Gujarat Forest Dept, Training & Res Wing, Gandhinagar 382010, Gujarat, India","Jhala, YV (corresponding author), Wildlife Inst India, Dept Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",jhalay@wii.gov.in,"Jani, Arpit/B-5376-2017; Jhala, Yadvendradev/AAL-9711-2020","Chakrabarti, Stotra/0000-0001-8741-4780",Wildlife Institute of India [SERB/F/0601/2013-2014]; Department of Science and TechnologyDepartment of Science & Technology (India) [SERB/F/0601/2013-2014],"We thank the Wildlife Institute of India and Department of Science and Technology for funding the study (Grant number: SERB/F/0601/2013-2014).

Early colonisers can affect the ability of subsequent arrivals to colonise and persist, and thereby influence the development and structure of the resulting assemblage. In two independent experiments, we tested for such historical effects of priority on the assemblages of mobile fauna colonising artificial seagrass initially occupied by epibiota (algae and sessile invertebrates) and/or predatory Palaemonid shrimp. Multivariate analyses detected strong priority effects of both epibiota and Palaemonids on the structure of faunal assemblages as early as 5 days, and up to 45 days after experimental treatments were established, even though initial conditions (i.e. abundances of epibiota and Palaemonids) had become similar among treatments. The abundances of key taxa, identified by SIMPER analyses as those taxa contributing the most to multivariate differences among treatments, were typically enhanced where epibiota were initially present. In contrast, prior colonisation by Palaemonid shrimp produced subtle and variable effects on individual taxa. Nevertheless, these experiments provide evidence for priority effects and demonstrate how variation in the structure of contemporary assemblages can be intimately linked with key historical events that occurred during their development, but may no longer be apparent. Consequently, our ability to interpret variation among contemporary assemblages may be enhanced when contemporary patterns are viewed within an historical context. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted survivorship and cohort lifetable experiments to determine whether Daphnia can utilize ciliates and rotifers as food. Three species of oligotrich ciliates (Halteria grandinella, Strobilidium gyrans and Strobilidium velox) and one rotifer (Keratella cochlearis) were used. Lifetable experiments were conducted with a basal level of algae (Cryptomonas sp.), plus either ciliates or rotifers, while survivorship experiments had only the rotifers or ciliates. Densities of 30 H.grandinella ml-1, 50 S.gyrans ml-1 and 15 S. velox ml-1 enhanced Daphnia pulex's population growth rate 35-50% over controls with only algae. Ten S.gyrans ml-1 did not produce a significant change in Daphnia's growth rate. Densities of 100 and 300 K.cochlearis l-1 increased Daphnia population growth rates by 11 and 10%, respectively. Both 10 and 50 S.gyrans ml-1 enhanced Daphnia's survivorship compared to starved controls, but neither 100 nor 300 K.cochlearis l-1 enhanced its survivorship. The amount of enhancement of Daphnia growth rates by rotifers and ciliates is roughly proportional to the death rates imposed by Daphnia. The death rate imposed by Daphnia on rotifers is a function of both algal density and Daphnia size. Per unit biomass, neither ciliates nor Keratella appear to be as nutritious for Daphnia as is Cryptomonas.","DARTMOUTH COLL,DEPT BIOL SCI,HANOVER,NH 03755; MAX PLANCK INST MARINE MIKROBIOL,BITZ,W-2800 BREMEN 33,GERMANY",,,,,,,,47,26,26,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM,OXFORD,"WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP",0142-7873,,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

We experimentally examined the effects of simulated pond drying, tank size (initial larval density), and body size on survival and cannibalism in larvae of the dragonflyAnax junius, a species known to show frequent size-structured cannibalism. Thirty tanks of 3 different sizes were each stocked with 8A. juniuslarvae (6 small, 1 medium, and 1 large) along withEnallagmadamselfly larvae as prey.Anax juniussurvival and cannibalism were documented daily for 16 d. For tanks in the permanent hydroperiod treatment, we maintained water depth at a constant 14 cm for all 16 d, while we gradually reduced depth in the temporary hydroperiod tanks from 14 to 2 cm to simulate pond drying. We found that cannibalism was strongly size-dependent, as 31, 7, and 0% of small, medium, and large larvae, respectively, were cannibalized. Tank size (initial larval density) and hydroperiod treatment both affected larval survival and cannibalism. However, the effects of simulated pond drying were more pronounced than those of tank size. In addition, hydroperiod treatment was a predictor of daily risk of larval cannibalism, but daily volumetric larval density (number ofA. juniusalive divided by water volume present that day) was not. Our results, therefore, indicate that 1) pond drying can substantially increase cannibalism in larval odonates beyond its simple effect of producing high-density populations as water levels recede and 2) the effect of drying cues on the behavior and life-history characteristics of aquatic invertebrates merit increased attention from freshwater ecologists.","[Gillespie, Catherine M.; Mumme, Ronald L.; Wissinger, Scott A.] Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, 520 North Main St, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; [Gillespie, Catherine M.; Wissinger, Scott A.] Allegheny Coll, Dept Environm Sci, 520 North Main St, Meadville, PA 16335 USA","Gillespie, CM (corresponding author), Allegheny Coll, Dept Biol, 520 North Main St, Meadville, PA 16335 USA.; Gillespie, CM (corresponding author), Allegheny Coll, Dept Environm Sci, 520 North Main St, Meadville, PA 16335 USA.",catherinegillespiem@gmail.com; rmumme@allegheny.edu,,,Allegheny College; Class of 1939 Senior Research Fund,"Financial assistance was provided by Allegheny College and the Class of 1939 Senior Research Fund.

To assess long-term environmental change experienced by low-nutrient, dimictic New Brunswick lakes we use sedimentary remains of algal pigments and Cladocera in dated cores from impact (prone to late-summer algal blooms, Lac Unique) and reference (no observed algal blooms, First and States) lakes. Overall, all three lakes now exhibit greater bosminid abundance and fewer daphniids, lower Cladocera richness, and smaller average cladoceran body size, although some lake-specific differences in assemblage response exist that cannot be related solely to top-down or bottom-up forces. Zooplankton trends are most pronounced at Lac Unique and First Lake, where algal production is generally greater. Across all three lakes, the only significant (IndVal: p < 0.05) cladoceran bioindicator of the post-1990 period is the pelagic bosminid group, whereas prior to 1990, Daphnia longispina-complex and several littoral taxa were significant (IndVal: p < 0.05) bioindicators. These temporal shifts suggest that the smaller-bodied bosminid group may now be favored over its larger-bodied pelagic competitor Daphnia sp. in these lakes, irrespective of heterogeneous long-term algal patterns inferred from stable sedimentary pigments. We suggest that the indirect effects of climate change, principally during the spring and summer quarters in New Brunswick, may be associated with marked shifts in limnological structure, as evidenced by changes in dominant zooplankton of the pelagic zone. However, further research is needed to rule out whether or not size-selective predation, and its potential interactions with climate change and other stressors, are key mechanisms favoring increased bosminids in low-nutrient, dimictic lakes.","[Daly, Margaux; Kurek, Joshua] Mt Allison Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Sackville, NB E4L 4B3, Canada; [Gregory-Eaves, Irene] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Patoine, Alain] Univ Moncton, Campus Shippigan, Shippigan, NB E8S 1P6, Canada","Kurek, J (corresponding author), Mt Allison Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Sackville, NB E4L 4B3, Canada.",jkurek@mta.ca,"Gregory-Eaves, Irene/U-9325-2019","Gregory-Eaves, Irene/0000-0002-0380-5061",2015-2016 New Brunswick Environmental Trust Fund (NB ETF) Grant; 2015 Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant; Independent Student Research Grant (ISRG) from Mount Allison University; Canada Research Chairs programCanada Research Chairs,"Funding for this research was provided by a 2015-2016 New Brunswick Environmental Trust Fund (NB ETF) Grant and a 2015 Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant to JK.

The role these grasses play in saltbush population demography is not well understood. We hypothesized that saltbush seedling recruitment and growth is limited by the competitive interactions with exotic grasses, preventing saltbush stands from maintaining their populations and expanding. We predicted that saltbush seedling recruitment would be reduced by (1) light and moisture competition with the grasses; and (2) the physical barrier of grass residual dry matter (RDM) formed during senescence. To test our predictions, we investigated saltbush seedling recruitment under field conditions across six saltbush populations. We examined how variations in edaphic structure and water availability by site may have affected saltbush seedling recruitment and longer-term population dynamics. In experimental plots where saltbush seeds were sowed, exotic grass RDM reduced saltbush seedling emergence compared to seeds sown in the absence of RDM; competition post-emergence was not significant. Saltbush seedlings transplanted into the field had lower mortality and less herbivory in invaded grassy habitats compared to seedlings planted in bare zones in between established, mature saltbush shrubs. Edaphic variation and water availability by site were likely key factors affecting the success of both grass invasion and saltbush recruitment. Our results suggest that there is a seed-seedling conflict: Sites favorable for saltbush seedling emergence (minimal grass cover among mature shrubs) are unfavorable for seedling survival due to high herbivory. Conversely, sites favorable for saltbush seedling survival (high grass coverage away from mature shrubs) are unfavorable for seedling emergence. The RDM produced by grasses represents an important stabilizing feedback favoring continued grass dominance.","[Coleman, Mitchell L.; Jacobsen, Anna L.; Pratt, R.

The idea that biotic interactions, including herbivory, predation and competition are more intense at lower latitudes is widely accepted and underpins several dominant theories on the latitudinal gradient in biodiversity. Current theory also predicts that the intense biotic interactions at low latitudes will select plants for greater defence against herbivores. We reviewed the literature to provide an assessment of the evidence for and against the hypothesis that herbivory is more intense at lower latitudes, and that plants from low latitudes are better defended than are plants from high latitudes. 2. Only 37% of the 38 latitudinal comparisons of herbivory showed higher herbivory at lower latitudes, and the average effect size in a meta-analysis was not significantly different from zero. Thus, the available data do not support the idea that herbivory is generally more intense in the tropics. 3. Only nine of 56 comparisons found higher chemical defences at lower latitudes, and a meta-analysis showed that overall, chemical defences were significantly higher in plants from higher latitudes. This result is counter to the predictions of much of the literature. 4. A meta-analysis showed no significant effect of latitude on physical defence. 5. A review of the literature on feeding trials and common garden experiments showed that herbivores tend to prefer tissue from high latitudes. This trend could stem from differences in overall defence that were not captured by the metrics used in the literature, but could also result from differences in nutritional quality. 6. The empirical data do not support the widespread view that herbivory is generally more intense at lower latitudes, or that plants from low latitudes are generally better defended than are plants from higher latitudes. These results are counter to the prevailing thought on this topic, and suggest that this field may be ripe for the development of new theory.","[Moles, Angela T.; Bonser, Stephen P.; Poore, Alistair G.

Cannibalism increased survivorship and shortened development time, and eating conspecifics that had fed upon higher-quality food further shortened early development. In a second experiment, we reared groups of H, axyridis larvae with one or both of two aphid species of poor (Uroleucon spp.) or intermediate [Aphis fabae (Scopoli)] quality, and either permitted or prevented cannibalism.

Predation is one factor that can have widespread effects on the mean trait value in a prey population because predators can impact prey traits through a number of processes. Predators can directly induce prey phenotypes through visual and chemical cues, predators can indirectly alter prey phenotypes by thinning the prey population (thereby reducing competition), and predators can cause selection on prey phenotypes through nonrandom killing. Ecologists are beginning to understand each of these three processes in isolation, but these processes act on prey phenotypes simultaneously, and we lack information on the relative importance of these processes in determining the final phenotype of prey. I used a system of gray treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) and dragonfly predators (Anax longipes) to determine the separate and combined impacts of induction, thinning, and selection on the behavior, morphology, and growth of tadpoles reared in aquatic mesocosms. Using combinations of hand thinning, cues emitted from caged predators, and lethal predators, I demonstrated that the impact of lethal predators on growth was mediated primarily through thinning, the impact on morphology was primarily through induction, and the impact on behavior was affected similarly through thinning and induction. Surprisingly, while we know from numerous studies that the dragonflies kill tadpoles nonrandomly, selection did not have a significant impact on the final phenotypes of the tadpoles. This work appears to be the first study that identifies the relative magnitudes of the three predatory processes on a suite of prey phenotypes. The three processes can have opposing or supporting effects, the relative magnitudes of which likely differ among systems, illustrating why we often observe contradictory results when we examine the impact of lethal predators on prey phenotypes. Thus, it is important that we identify the mechanisms underlying the outcomes of predation, rather than simply observing the outcomes and then inferring which processes are responsible.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Sci Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Relyea, RA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Sci Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",relyea+@pitt.edu,,,,,,65,76,79,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2002,83,7,,,,,1953,1964,,10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[1953:TMFOPH]2.0.CO;2,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,571LD,WOS:000176718100015,,,,,2021-09-27,

Field and laboratory data were incorporated into two simulation models to examine the influences of patchiness and the intraspecific aggregation of spores in promoting the coexistence of these mosses. Coexistence within a single peatland in a 'local dynamics' model and coexistence over three adjacent peatlands in a 'regional dynamics' model was examined. In both models, the spore production from droppings was determined by using Ricker-type equations that were modified by removing the intraspecific competition coefficient since the mean reproductive output of spores from a dropping appears to be independent of the recruitment of spores to that dropping and by assuming that the reproductive output from a dropping is a function of the relative proportion of spores of different species that were distributed on that dropping when it was fresh. Two types of simulation experiments using these models were performed: in one set the fixed number of droppings per peatland was varied, in a second set the mean number of droppings and the magnitude of year-to-year fluctuations about this mean was varied. In both models the mosses persisted longer as the number of droppings/peatland was increased, regardless of whether the number of droppings/peatland was held constant or fluctuated randomly. Also, in both models the two mosses coexisted for a longer time as the degree of intraspecific aggregation of spores increased. There was little difference between times to extinction in the regional dynamics model, either with or without dispersal of spores between adjacent peatlands, and the local dynamics model in which the number of droppings either equaled or fluctuated within the same range of values as the total number of droppings in the regional dynamics model.","UNIV ALBERTA,DEPT ZOOL,EDMONTON T6G 2E9,ALBERTA,CANADA","MARINO, PC (corresponding author), UNIV DELAWARE,SCH LIFE & HLTH SCI,NEWARK,DE 19716, USA.",,,,,,,20,5,5,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

The present study investigates the feeding and movement of a size structured population of gobies residing in crab burrow micro-habitats, within this context. All life-history stages of the goby Redigobius dewaali were found to utilize burrow-pools formed by the crab Scylla serrata in the mangrove intertidal zone of an estuary at low tide. Gut content analysis was therefore conducted to test for feeding overlap and potential intraspecific competition among various sizes of fish residing in these habitats. In addition, an exclosure experiment was conducted to determine whether these fish leave the burrow-pools at high tide to forage over the intertidal flats. While ontogenetic dietary shifts across size-classes occurred, copepods and amphipods comprised the most important components of the diet for most size-classes, resulting in a large degree of dietary overlap. Of the adult R. dewaali sampled from pools, a single large mature male was sampled from each burrow, suggesting territoriality, a trait well observed in males of many goby species. The experimental component of the study highlighted the movement of smaller individuals, but not larger individuals, from the burrow-pools at high tide. As all life-history stages occur in the same microhabitats, and forage on much of the same prey, we suggest that the existence of a competitive hierarchy resulted in the need for the smaller individuals to find alternate feeding areas, consistent with dominance hierarchy theory.

Here, we examine trophic segregation among seabird species breeding on Sao Pedro and Sao Paulo Archipelago (SPSPA), in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, as well as the trophic relationships between the seabirds and pelagic fish. We used stable isotopes (delta N-15, delta C-13) combined with a conventional dietary analysis of brown booby (Sula leucogaster), brown noddy (Anous stolidus), and black noddy (Anous minutus) and also analysed stable isotopes in the muscles of tropical two-wing flying fish (Exocoetus volitans), blackfin tuna (Thunnus atlanticus), and common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus). Brown boobies shared a similar trophic level with large predatory fish probably due to their intense consumption of flying fish, but seabirds are most likely not competing with blackfin tuna and common dolphinfish, despite relying on the same prey. Food resources seem to be abundant around SPSPA, minimizing competition. Despite relying mostly on two-wing flying fish, the three seabirds studied had non-overlapping trophic niches during the breeding period, with segregation apparently occurring by prey size. Sex-related trophic differences were not found, but age-related trophic segregation was observed in brown boobies and brown noddies. Overall, although seabirds and marine pelagic fish rely on the same prey species, the overlap in their trophic niches was limited, most likely due to an overabundant food resource, i.e. flying fish, a common prey of large predators in most pelagic tropical oceans.","Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Inst Ciencias Biol, Lab Aves Aquat & Tartarugas Marinhas, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Programa Posgrad Oceanog Biol, Inst Oceanog, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil","Mancini, PL (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Museu Zool, Sec Aves, CP 42694, BR-04299970 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",patmancinibr@yahoo.com.br,"Bugoni, Leandro/F-9539-2012","Bugoni, Leandro/0000-0003-0689-7026",National Research and Development Council of Brazil (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [Proc. 557152/09-7]; CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Brazilian CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [308697/2012-0],"We would like to thank Felipe Neves, Fernanda Marques, Maira Proietti, Manuela Creio, and Mauro Koga for assistance in the field.

These habitats represented five different monospecific assemblages of one of the following species: the brown alga Fucus serratus, the red alga Delesseria sanguinea, the green alga Enteromorpha intestinalis, the seagrass Zostera marina and the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. Natural assemblages were allowed to develop on paired artificial substrata-separated by ca. 1 m -within (treatment) vs, outside (control) of habitats. The same colonizer species settled on treatment and control substrata for given habitats. However, after 5 months of settlement and post-settlement dynamics, their proportional abundance and the structure of treatment and control assemblages differed in many instances. Variability among replicates of a given treatment, seperated by up to 50 m, was large, indicating a patchy spatial distribution of organisms. Despite this spatial heterogeneity among within-treatment replicates, analysis of similarity revealed that in most instances significantly different assemblages developed between treatments on a small spatial scale depending on whether substrate were positioned within as compared to outside a, given habitat. Consequently, the algae, seagrass or mussels constituting a habitat seem to control the structure of the benthic assemblage developing in their vicinity by one or more possible mechanisms: reduction of larval advection, exudation of metabolites that influence settlement and/or post-settlement survival, and/or-in the case of mussel assemblages-predation on larvae. In addition to spatial variability in larval supply, stochasticity in succession, substratum heterogeneity, competition and predation effects, this investigation reveals the potential of a further assemblage structuring factor: the impact of neighboring organisms.

Yet, marking animals may affect life histories and it is important to quantify such effects. Literature on this subject is relatively rare, especially when it concerns the effect of bird rings. This is partly because control groups are often missing, since the rings were not applied with the goal to measure their effect on life histories. From studies in captivity there is evidence that the colour of rings may affect partner choice and in the field certain outstanding colours of rings may affect predation risk. Here we use data of an ongoing study of Great Tits Parus major to analyse whether the colour of rings fitted in different combinations to nestling Great Tits (day 14, n = 9818) affected their life histories in terms of natal dispersal, first year local recapture rate, breeding performance and second year local recapture rate. We measured reflectance spectra to quantify the brightness of the colour rings, and we used a human panel to judge the conspicuousness of the rings against a grey background. We found support for a positive effect of the conspicuousness, as judged by human observers, of the colour ring combination on local recapture rate, but not on natal dispersal suggesting that survival was affected. No effect was detected on breeding performance. The brightness of the rings did not explain variation in life history components. Although the effect of conspicuousness was statistically weak, the effect size is of potential biological importance. Life expectancy of individuals without conspicuous rings is estimated to be 28% shorter than for individuals with three conspicuous rings. Our result could have a considerable impact on life history studies where fitness measures are based on colour-marked bird populations. Colour of the colour rings will affect the variance of fitness estimates and may even bias the mean of fitness estimates when specific colours are used in specific periods, in specific environments or to mark particular categories of birds like year classes.","[Tinbergen, J.

In this article, we draw on all three to study mechanisms of coexistence, uniting these fields of theory via a set of related models based on Holling's disc equation and four different types and arrangements of resources. Using established rules for optimal behavior and habitat selection within a framework of consumer-resource models, we explore how unavoidable trade-offs in conversion efficiency, handling time, and encounter efficiency affect coexistence between species. When resources are nutritionally substitutable and spatially mixed, our model predicts that only trade-offs in encounter efficiency can promote coexistence. For spatially separate substitutable resources, any trade-off in encounter, conversion, or handling efficiency allows coexistence. For essential resources, whether mixed or separate, only trade-offs in conversion efficiency can promote coexistence. Since trade-offs that promote coexistence vary depending on the type of resource, this indicates that mechanisms of coexistence can differ depending on how consumers view their resources and how resources are distributed in the environment.","UNIV MINNESOTA, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA; PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND SCI CTR, CORDOVA, AK 99574 USA; UNIV ILLINOIS, DEPT BIOL SCI, CHICAGO, IL 60607 USA; UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT AEROSP & MECH ENGN, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",,,"Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012",,,,,44,68,68,1,29,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Herein, we tested the independent and interactive effects of ISS and a generalist fish (Blacktail shiner, Cyprinella venusta) on suspended organic matter (SOM), benthic algae, invertebrate density and fish growth using experimental mesocosms. We found that Blacktail shiner foraging affected all of the ecosystem properties; however, in some cases, the fish effects differed between mesocosms with and without ISS. Specifically, mesocosms with ISS provided greater surface area for invertebrate colonisation and enhanced food resources for Blacktail shiner. As a result, benthic foraging by Blacktail shiner was reduced in these mesocosms. The reduced benthic foraging in turn enhanced benthic algae and benthic invertebrates via a bottom-up, nutrient excretion pathway. The ISS-dependent effects of fish on these stream properties, however, were only evident at low and intermediate fish densities (1 and 2fishm(-2) respectively). This was likely because at the highest fish density (4fishm(-2)) intense fish foraging overrode any mediating effects of ISS. Furthermore, fish growth decreased with fish density because of intraspecific competition, but this negative effect on growth was reduced in mesocosms with ISS because of the increased forage base. However, the positive effect on fish growth was weak and only marginally significant. Our data suggest that fish-mediated effects on streams are context dependent, changing with microhabitat availability (e.g. ISS) and density of the fish population.","[Gary, Kaitlen P.; Hargrave, Chad W.] Sam Houston State Univ, Ctr Biol Field Studies, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA; [Gary, Kaitlen P.; Hargrave, Chad W.] Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 2116, Huntsville, TX 77341 USA; [Gary, Kaitlen P.] Sam Houston State Univ, Texas Res Inst Environm Studies, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA","Hargrave, CW (corresponding author), Sam Houston State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Box 2116, Huntsville, TX 77341 USA.",cwhargrave@shsu.edu,,,,,,65,1,1,2,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

Lotka and Vito Volterra have had an enormous impact on ecology over the past century. Some of the earliest-and clearest-experimental tests of these models were famously conducted by Georgy Gause in the 1930s. Although well known, the data from these experiments are not widely available and are often difficult to analyze using standard statistical and computational tools. Point 2: Here, we introduce the gauseR package, a collection of tools for fitting Lotka-Volterra models to time series data of one or more species. The package includes several methods for parameter estimation and optimization, and includes 42 datasets from Gause's species interaction experiments and related work. Additionally, we include with this paper a short blog post discussing the historical importance of these data and models, and an R vignette with a walk-through introducing the package methods. The package is available for download at github.com/adamtclark/gauseR. Point 3: To demonstrate the package, we apply it to several classic experimental studies from Gause, as well as two other well-known datasets on multi-trophic dynamics on Isle Royale, and in spatially structured mite populations. In almost all cases, models fit observations closely and fitted parameter values make ecological sense. Point 4: Taken together, we hope that the methods, data, and analyses that we present here provide a simple and user-friendly way to interact with complex ecological data. We are optimistic that these methods will be especially useful to students and educators who are studying ecological dynamics, as well as researchers who would like a fast tool for basic analyses.","[Muehlbauer, Lina K.; Schulze, Maximilienne; Harpole, W.

Therefore, we investigated associations among walleye recruitment and climatic, water-level, and biotic characteristics in four Kansas reservoirs during 1985-1999. Walleye recruitment was positively related to spring storage ratios and temperatures and negatively associated with spring water levels and abundance of 130- to 199-mm white crappies (Pomoxis annularis). The influence of juvenile white crappie predation on larval walleyes was examined by conducting a manipulative experiment. Regardless of zooplankton density or water clarity, mortality of larval walleyes resulting from white crappie predation was over 90%. Based on our empirical and experimental results, we propose a biotic-abiotic confining hypothesis (BACH) to explain abiotic and biotic effects on walleye recruitment dynamics. Specifically, high variability in walleye recruitment was observed during years with low densities of 130- to 199-mm white crappies and likely resulted from the effects of abiotic factors. When white crappie abundance was high, walleye recruitment was low and exhibited little variability, suggesting that white crappies can have an overriding influence on walleye recruitment regardless of abiotic conditions.","Kansas State Univ, US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div, Kansas Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; Kansas Dept Wildlife & Pk, Emporia, KS 66801 USA","Quist, MC (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Wyoming Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",,,,,,,41,37,41,0,14,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0706-652X,,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Nearly 16 000 saffron cod were captured in 49 of 95 beach seine hauls at 8 locations in western PWS in 2006 and 2007. Saffron cod accounted for 32% of the total fish catch (49 060 fish, 45 species). Abundance of saffron cod differed by season and habitat type; catch was greater in summer and fall than in spring, and fish were captured almost exclusively in eelgrass Zostera marina habitat. Most saffron cod captured were Age-0; based on age from otoliths, mean size of Age-0 fish increased from 70 mm total length (TL) (n = 8) in July to 108 mm TL (n = 21) in September. Age-0 saffron cod consumed predominantly pelagic fauna (oikopleurans), whereas fish aged >= 1 targeted predominantly epibenthic fauna (polychaetes and crustaceans). Most saffron cod left the nearshore area by late summer; of 1002 fish that were fin-clipped and released at 1 sampling location (eelgrass) in July 2007, only 2 were recaptured in late August 2007. Reasons for the sudden and dramatic increase in the abundance of saffron cod in western PWS are unclear; possible ecological implications, however, include competition for food and space and increased predation risk to commercially important and forage fish species.","[Johnson, Scott W.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; Fisheries Sci Ctr, Auke Bay Labs, Juneau, AK 99801 USA","Johnson, SW (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 17109 Pt Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.",scott.johnson@noaa.gov,,,North Pacific Research Board [642]; NOAA Fisheries Essential Fish Habitat Program,"We thank the crews of the RV 'Solstice' and RV 'Pandalus' for their invaluable support at sea; and D.

Because the evolutionary advantage of this behaviour is generally unknown, we used controlled group size manipulations within an aviary to investigate whether group size influences (1) the time that the covey spends feeding, (2) the percentage of the covey that is vigilant, (3) the overall vigilance of the group and (4) the time to predator detection. We found that increasing group size increased the time that coveys spent in an exposed feeding area, reduced individual vigilance, improved group vigilance and decreased the time to detection of a potential predator. Additionally, we used experimental reductions of wild northern bobwhite coveys to test whether groups size influences (1) individual and covey survival, (2) daily movement in maintaining covey size and (3) mass change. We conducted field research on 12 independent 259-ha study areas (6 control plots and 6 treatments, where 60% of the population was removed) in east-central Kansas, U.S.A. between 9 November and 31 January, 1997-2000. We radio-marked 386 radiocollared individuals that comprised 137 groups on the study areas. Covey size did not differ between or within years or treatments ((X) over bar +/- SE: 10.98 +/- 0.22 individuals). Our results indicate that a stable group size existed between I and 22 individuals, with 11 being an optimal group size. Small coveys (1-7 individuals) had lower group persistence and individual survival, and used increased movement to create or join larger groups where survival was higher. Large groups (15-22) had lower individual survival, increased group movement and individual mass loss. Density-dependent feedbacks (e.g. lower survival and increased competition) may have lowered larger coveys to a stable size. Our results suggest the regulation of an optimal covey size of 11 was promoted by high group persistence, low group movement, improved feeding efficiency, improved individual predator detection and improved individual survival.

In the western U.S., the sagebrush ecosystem has been seriously altered by the invasion of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), an exotic annual, and other species including smooth brome (B. inermis), an exotic perennial. We monitored 112 Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella brewed) nests (2006 and 2007) in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, to assess the potential effects of a smooth brome vs. native understory on nest survival in sagebrush steppe. Brewer's Sparrows settled earlier and clutch size was larger in native habitat, but indices of nest success were higher in the exotic habitat. Rates of failure and nest predation were higher in the native habitat. Using the logistic-exposure method, we compared estimates of survival in the two habitats. The model with the greatest support, according to AlCe model-selection criteria, consisted of year and percent cover of smooth brome. Daily survival was higher in the exotic habitat in both years combined and in 2007 alone. The hot, dry conditions of both years may have contributed indirectly to the year effect by influencing the abundance and distribution of predator and prey. The observed increase in daily nest survival with increasing cover of smooth brome suggests that in this situation, Brewer's Sparrows benefited from the presence of smooth brome. The denser smooth brome may serve as a refugium for insects during hot, dry summers. Smooth brome may also increase nest concealment.","[Ruehmann, Megan B.; Desmond, Martha J.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Ecol, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Gould, William R.] New Mexico State Univ, Appl Stat Program, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA","Ruehmann, MB (corresponding author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Ecol, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",mdesmond@nmsu.edu,,,Grand Teton National Park; T E Incorporated; University of Wyoming/AMK Research Station; New Mexico State University; U.S. Hatch Act,"We are indebted to the staff of Grand Teton National Park, particularly S.

Yet, previous research suggests that large Daphnia do not always dominate in the absence of predation. As alternatives to the planktivory model, numerous mechanisms have been put forth, including the effect of resource competition and its interaction with resource quantity and quality and abiotic factors (e.g. temperature). Here results are presented of a field survey of 18 fishless, permanent ponds in southwest Michigan in which spatiotemporal variation in Daphnia pulex abundance and several potential determinants of this variation are explored. Results revealed a large amount of variation in D. pulex incidence and relative biomass, with some ponds exhibiting seasonal losses, some having few or no Daphnia, and some being dominated by D. pulex for the entire sample period. Redundancy analysis of zooplankton composition and pond environmental variables (biotic and abiotic) showed no relationship between D. pulex biomass and measures of Chaoborus abundance, algal resource production, or algal resource quality (including seston C:N:P). Instead, pH and temperature (both of which covaried) showed the strongest relationship with D. pulex biomass.","Michigan State Univ, WK Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA","Steiner, CF (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Anim Biol, 515 Morrill Hall,505 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",csteiner@life.uiuc.edu,,,,,,46,29,30,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-7873,1464-3774,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

Hiding decisions are economic in that individuals trade off the physiological costs of hiding with the benefits of increased security. The number of conspecifics may increase competition, security, or attract predators, influencing predation risk. We studied hiding time in Christmas tree worms (Spirobranchus giganteus), sessile marine invertebrates, which lived with 0-17 other worms within 20 cm. Competition and predation risk reduction both predict a shorter latency to re-emerge given the necessity to feed and potential for safety in numbers, respectively. In contrast, if grouped worms attract more predators, individuals should hide longer. We experimentally induced hiding in 174 worms and found a significant, positive relationship between hiding time and number of conspecifics. We repeated the test 4 consecutive times in 1 day on a subset of 30 worms that were either solitary or lived with one other untested worm. We found that worms with longer hiding times habituated more quickly than worms with shorter hiding times, and that the individual worm explained 55.8% of the variation in hiding time. When we conducted the trials for 4 days, we found that the individual worm explained 41.75% of the variation, but no evidence of behavioral plasticity. Worm antipredator responses were consistently individualistic, but behavioral plasticity was only evident over short time scales. For sessile marine invertebrates, higher densities may attract predators, enhancing rather than diluting predation risk. Worms that cannot move away from their neighbors, thus seemingly modify antipredator behavior in consistent ways.","[Pezner, Ariel K.; Lim, Anthony R.; Kang, Jane J.; Armenta, Tiffany C.; Blumstein, Daniel T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA","Blumstein, DT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",marmots@ucla.edu,,"Pezner, Ariel/0000-0002-6076-7049",UCLA Office of Instructional Development; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,"This work was supported in part by UCLA Office of Instructional Development, and the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.",,105,7,7,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Using created oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reef mesocosms, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments that created structure and manipulated complexity as well as prey density and predator-free space to examine the relationship between structural complexity and prey survivorship. Specifically, volume and spatial arrangement of oysters as well as prey density were manipulated, and the survivorship of prey (grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio) in the presence of a predator (wild red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus) was quantified. We found that the presence of structure increased prey survivorship, and that increasing complexity of this structure further increased survivorship, but only to a point. This agrees with the theory that structural complexity may influence predator-prey dynamics, but that a threshold exists with diminishing returns. These results held true even when prey density was scaled to structural complexity, or the amount of predator-free space was manipulated within our created reef mesocosms. The presence of structure and its complexity (oyster shell volume) were more important in facilitating prey survivorship than perceived refugia or density-dependent prey effects. A more accurate indicator of refugia might require predator-free space measures that also account for the available area within the structure itself (i.e., volume) and not just on the surface of a structure. Creating experiments that better mimic natural conditions and test a wider range of predator-free space are suggested to better understand the role of structural complexity in oyster reefs and other complex habitats.","[Humphries, Austin T.; La Peyre, Megan K.] Louisiana State Univ, US Geol Survey, Louisiana Fish & Wildlife Cooperat Res Unit, Sch Renewable Nat Resources,AgCtr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Humphries, Austin T.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa","Humphries, AT (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, US Geol Survey, Louisiana Fish & Wildlife Cooperat Res Unit, Sch Renewable Nat Resources,AgCtr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",austin.humphries@gmail.com,,,Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries; Louisiana Sea Grant,"The authors thank the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (http://www.wlf.louisiana.gov) for financial support, and Louisiana Sea Grant for funding through a grant to GD under the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (http://www.laseagrant.org/urop/index.htm).

Because insects and fungi often compete for dead organic material, insects may achieve protection against fungi by reducing sensitivity to fungal chemicals. This, in turn, may lead to increased resistance allowing insects better to suppress the spread of antagonistic but non-pathogenic microbes in their habitat. However, it remains controversial whether fungal toxins serve as a chemical shield that selects for insects that are less sensitive to toxins, and hence favors the evolution of insect resistance against microbial competitors. Results: To examine the relationship between the ability to survive competition with toxic fungi, sensitivity to fungal toxins and resistance, we created fungal-selected (FS) replicated insect lines by exposing Drosophila melanogaster larvae to the fungal competitor Aspergillus nidulans over 26 insect generations. Compared to unselected control lines (UC), larvae from the FS lines had higher survival rates in the presence of A. nidulans indicating selection for increased protection against the fungal antagonist. In line with our expectation, FS lines were less susceptible to the A. nidulans mycotoxin Sterigmatocystin. Of particular interest is that evolved protection against A. nidulans and Sterigmatocytin was not correlated with increased insect survival in the presence of other fungi and mycotoxins. We found no evidence that FS lines were better at suppressing the expansion of fungal colonies but observed a trend towards a less detrimental effect of FS larvae on fungal growth. Conclusion: Antagonistic but non-pathogenic fungi favor insect variants better protected against the fungal chemical arsenal. This highlights the often proposed but experimentally underexplored importance of secondary metabolites in driving animal-fungus interactions. Instead of enhanced resistance, insect larvae tend to have evolved increased tolerance of the fungal competitor. Future studies should examine whether sensitivity to allelopathic microbial metabolites drives a trade-off between resistance and tolerance in insect external defense.","[Trienens, Monika; Rohlfs, Marko] Univ Kiel, Inst Zool, Dept Evolutionary Ecol & Genet, Bot Garten 1 9, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Trienens, Monika; Rohlfs, Marko] Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Rohlfs, M (corresponding author), Univ Kiel, Inst Zool, Dept Evolutionary Ecol & Genet, Bot Garten 1 9, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.",mrohlfs@uni-goettingen.de,"Rohlfs, Marko/A-8686-2011; Rohlfs, Marko/AAF-6749-2019","Trienens, Monika/0000-0002-1874-1160; Rohlfs, Marko/0000-0002-8767-1629","DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission [Ro3523/2-1, 3-1]","We thank Nancy P.

Previous studies show that the morphological responses to predator absence/presence and diet may be similar, and hence could confound the interpretation of the causes of morphological differences found between groups of individuals. In this study, we simultaneously examined the effect of these two factors on body shape and performance in crucian carp in a laboratory experiment. Crucian carp (Carassius carassius) developed a shallow body shape when feeding on zooplankton prey and a deep body shape when feeding on benthic chironomids. In addition, the presence of chemical cues from a pike predator affected body shape, where a shallow body shape was developed in the absence of pike and a deep body shape was developed in the presence of pike. Foraging activity was low in the presence of pike cues and when chironomids were given as prey. Our results thereby suggest that the change in body shape could be indirectly mediated through differences in foraging activity. Finally, the induced body shape changes affected the foraging efficiency, where crucians raised on a zooplankton diet or in the absence of pike cues had a higher foraging success on zooplankton compared to crucian raised on a chironomid diet or in the presence of pike. These results suggest that body changes in response to predators can be associated with a cost, in terms of competition for resources.","Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden","Andersson, J (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",jens.andersson@emg.umu.se,,,,,,50,50,52,1,25,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

The autotrophic fraction was almost entirely composed of diatoms in late winter. As the seasons progressed, relative abundance of nanoplankton and cyanobacteria increased. Microzooplankton was always present in the diet of mesozooplankton, even if in percentages usually not exceeding 6% of diet intake on carbon basis. Microzooplankton took advantage of ephemeral increases of autotrophic biomass when prey were in the optimal size range but did not consume diatoms when these were large. When autotrophic resources were scarce, micrograzers used heterotrophic biomass which, in turn, fuelled the upper trophic levels through predation by mesozooplankton on microzooplankton. Microzooplankton grazing was the most important loss term of primary production in the Gulf of Trieste (on average, microzooplankton consumed similar to 100% of primary production, while mesozooplankton only 76%), which can be considered a mesotrophic coastal system.","Univ Trieste, Dept Biol, I-34127 Trieste, Italy; Marine Biol Lab, I-34010 Trieste, Italy","Umani, SF (corresponding author), Univ Trieste, Dept Biol, Via Giorgieri 10, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.",labbioma@units.it,"Fonda, Serena/H-6753-2012","Beran, Alfred/0000-0003-3723-4161; Tirelli, Valentina/0000-0002-5152-2891",,,,63,27,27,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-7873,1464-3774,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

Amphibians are experiencing population declines, and a fungal pathogen (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Chytridiomycota) is a suspected causal agent in many declines. We studied the effects of a pathogenic fungus on community interactions between the gray treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis, and eastern newts, Notophthalmus viridescens. Recent studies have characterized chytridiomycosis as an emerging infectious disease, whose suspected rapid range expansion and widespread occurrence pose a significant risk for amphibian populations worldwide. We reared larvae in outdoor polyethylene experimental tanks and tested the effects of initial larval density, predator presence, and fungal exposure on Hyla recruitment and predator-prey interactions between Hyla and Notophthalmus. Newts reduced treefrog survival, and high intraspecific density decreased metamorphic body mass independent of B. dendrobatidis. The presence of fungi reduced treefrog body mass at metamorphosis by 34%, but had no significant main effect on survival or larval period length. B. dendrobatidis differentially affected larval development in the presence of predators; Hyla developed slower when reared with the pathogen, but only when newts were present. This significant predator-by-pathogen interaction suggests that the impact of chytridiomycosis on larval amphibians may be exacerbated in complex communities. Our data suggest that B. dendrobatidis effects on host life history may be complex and indirect. Direct measurements of the community-level effects of pathogens offer an important opportunity to understand a significant threat to global biodiversity-declining amphibian populations.","Univ Memphis, Dept Biol, Memphis, TN 38152 USA","Parris, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Memphis, Dept Biol, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",mparris@memphis.edu,,,,,,63,50,52,0,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2004,140,4,,,,,626,632,,10.1007/s00442-004-1631-2,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,845TF,WOS:000223266500011,15235903,,,,2021-09-27,

Seven apple scab-resistant cultivars, showing some differences in their leaf morphology, were compared. Each cultivar was grafted onto three different rootstocks inducing increasing vigor. The intraplant distribution of A andersoni was also studied by monitoring predator densities on basal and apical leaves. In the first year, the colonization of different cultivars by A andersoni showed definite patterns, sometimes associated with the abundance of the eriophyid Aculus scblechtendali. In the second experimental season, eriophyids reached negligible levels and the effect of cultivar on A andersoni abundance was less clear. Florida and N.Y. 18491 cultivars were colonized in both. years by relatively high phytoseiid numbers, while TSR 29T219 and Priscilla showed low populations in at least one season. The results observed on the remaining cultivars were intermediate or indefinite. The role of leaf pubescence on phytoseiid colonization is discussed.","Univ Padua, Dipartimento Agron Ambientale & Prod Vegetali, I-35020 Legnaro, Padova, Italy","Duso, C (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dipartimento Agron Ambientale & Prod Vegetali, Via Romea 16, I-35020 Legnaro, Padova, Italy.",carlo.duso@unipd.it,"duso, carlo/AAG-8435-2020","Duso, Carlo/0000-0002-2600-2536",,,,49,17,20,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-5693,,,ANZ SCHADL-J PEST SC,Anz.

Limitation based on annual stock assessments and total allowable catches calculated from these assessments can be very dangerous, and marine protected areas (MPAs) are one means by which to limit exploitation rate directly even when total stock size is highly uncertain. This application of MPAs would probably require much larger areas than are now envisioned for limited objectives related to protection of seed spawning stock and local biodiversity. It might in fact cause a basic shift in thinking-from regarding MPAs as exceptional areas to regarding fishing areas as the exception las is now the practice in, e.g., salmon and herring fisheries). The present paper describes the use of ECOSPACE, a new modeling tool based on ecosystem simulations, for preliminary determination of how large MPAs need to be; ECOSPACE models suggest that dispersal, trophic responses (prey depletion, increased dispersal of predators in response to competition), and spatial fishing-effort responses (concentration of fishing near MPA boundaries) are all likely to reduce the effectiveness of small MPAs. The models suggest we should see not simple high-low density differences across MPA boundaries but rather spatial gradients from law density in exploited areas to high density near the centers of larger MPAs. Such spatial density gradients should be accompanied by spatially organized 'trophic cascade' patterns if trophic interactions are important determinants of abundance. MPA design can work with or against spatial variation in fishing effort caused by economic cost and risk factors; ECOSPACE can help to demonstrate ecological consequences of alternative design strategies, but the most important uncertainties are about socioeconomic responses (cooperation or competition) rather than ecological ones. Design of experimental policies and monitoring programs for evaluation of MPAs should proceed from careful modeling to define likely spatial, temporal, and trophic scales for both ecological and fishing responses.","Univ British Columbia, Fisheries Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Walters, C (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fisheries Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",,"Walters, Carl/D-5714-2012",,,,,29,115,116,1,24,ROSENSTIEL SCH MAR ATMOS SCI,MIAMI,"4600 RICKENBACKER CAUSEWAY, MIAMI, FL 33149 USA",0007-4977,,,B MAR SCI,Bull.

Their genetic relationship to growth rate and to each other is, however, not fully understood. In this study we present evidence that schooling, social tolerance, and agonistic behavior in medaka (Oryzias latipes) are altered as an indirect result of selection on growth in two environments that differed in the intensity of social interactions required to obtain access to food. In the high interaction environment food was provided to excess inside a floating cork ring, which limited access to the food and allowed fish to attempt to monopolize it. In the low interaction environment the same amount of food was spread over the container's surface. After two generations of selection on growth the correlation of agonistic behavior and mean growth of broods was negative in the line selected for fast growth, when selection took place in a high interaction environment, but not when it took place in a low interaction environment. School cohesion was higher in the lines selected for fast growth than in those selected for slow growth when selection and rearing environments were both the same, either high or low interaction, but not when they were different. The correlation of social tolerance with growth was significantly more positive in the line selected for fast growth than in that selected for slow growth, but only when selection took place under high social interaction. It appears from these experiments that when resources are aggregated, but unlimited in quantity, competition favors individuals that avoid wasting time and energy on unnecessary and ultimately futile attempts to monopolize food and that also exhibit higher tolerance of nearby conspecifics. The results are interpreted in terms of a hypothesized stimulus-response threshold level for agonistic responses to conspecifics. We suggest that this threshold, which is altered by selection on growth, could provide a common causal (genetic) link between growth and the observed aspects of social behavior. By combining the probabilities from the separate behavioral experiments to obtain an overall significance of our hypothesis we conclude that the probability of no change in threshold is in fact low (P < 0.01).",,"RUZZANTE, DE (corresponding author), DALHOUSIE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, HALIFAX B3H 4J1, NS, CANADA.",,,"Ruzzante, Daniel/0000-0002-8536-8335",,,,40,46,46,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,APR,1993,47,2,,,,,456,470,,10.2307/2410064,,,15,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,KZ712,WOS:A1993KZ71200009,28568721,,,,2021-09-27,

Integrated Weed Management currently recommends agronomic practices for weed control, but it does not integrate the use of biodiversity-based options, enhancing the biological regulation of weeds. Here, wereview existing knowledge related to three potentially beneficial interactions, of crop-weed competition, weed seed granivory, and weed interactions with pathogenic fungi. Our main finding are the following : (1) promoting cropped plant-weed competition by manipulating cropped cover could greatly contribute to weed reduction; (2) weed seed granivory by invertebrates can significantly lower weed emergence, although this effect can be highly variable because seed predation is embedded within complex multitrophic interactions that are to date not fully understood; (3) a wide range of fungi are pathogenic to various stages of weed development, but strain efficacy in field trials does not often match that in controlled conditions. We present a framework that superimposes biodiversity-based options for weed biocontrol on a classical Integrated Weed Management system. We then describe the current state of knowledge on interactions between agronomic practices and the organisms at play and between the different biological components of the system. We argue that further advances in our understanding of biodiversity-based options and their performance for weed biocontrol will require farm-scale experimental trials.","[Petit, Sandrine; Cordeau, Stephane; Chauvel, Bruno; Bohan, David; Guillemin, Jean-Philippe; Steinberg, Christian] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, INRA, AgroSupDijon, Agroecol, F-21000 Dijon, France","Petit, S (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, INRA, AgroSupDijon, Agroecol, F-21000 Dijon, France.",sandrine.petit-michaut@inra.fr,"Steinberg, Christian/AAU-8872-2020; Cordeau, Stephane/AAL-7447-2020; Bohan, David A/D-7992-2012; CORDEAU, Stephane/K-6926-2012; Petit, Sandrine/C-3310-2013","Steinberg, Christian/0000-0002-5447-5349; Bohan, David A/0000-0001-5656-775X; CORDEAU, Stephane/0000-0003-1069-8388; Petit, Sandrine/0000-0001-8781-8873",,,,229,19,19,5,59,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1774-0746,1773-0155,,AGRON SUSTAIN DEV,Agron.

We use otolith microstructure analysis to study the life history of 2 widespread and abundant Caribbean reef fishes, genetically identified here as the glass goby Coryphopterus hyalinus and masked goby C. personatus. Our analysis reveals that these species exhibit an extreme life history relative to other vertebrates due to their short lifespan, small adult body size, early maturity, and continuous growth in body length throughout reproductive age. We find that pelagic larval duration (PLD) varies widely, and average larval growth influences PLD where faster-growing larvae have shorter PLDs. We show that average daily growth substantially decreases during the settlement transition to reef habitat, approximately coinciding with reproductive maturity. Continuous somatic growth throughout reproductive age can serve to support greater fecundity in older, larger-bodied females and enhance survivorship. Several features of the ecology (i.e. broad depth range, planktivorous diet) and life history (i.e. small adult body size, quick generational turnover, short lifespan) of C. hyalinus and C. personatus indicate that they play a key trophic role in transferring nutrients from pelagic plankton to Caribbean reef predators and the reef benthos. Our analyses highlight why life history traits related to survival, reproduction, and population dynamics can enhance our understanding of ecosystem-scale processes and functioning on coral reefs.","[Beeken, Nicolette S.; Selwyn, Jason D.; Hogan, J.

Shrubs in arid and semi-arid ecosystems are often associated with three distinct patch types: the shrub core, the shrub periphery and surrounding open patches. The distribution of herbaceous seeds in such a patchy system exhibits a well-documented spatial heterogeneity. However, the mechanisms that generate this heterogeneity are poorly understood, not least because of the difficulty of separating possible effects of the shrub on seed production (via the shrub's modification of resource distribution), seed dispersal and post-dispersal processes. 2. We used a well-studied system dominated by a common east Mediterranean shrub (Sarcopoterium spinosum) to directly test the effect of shrubs on herbaceous community seed dispersal. We clipped all potential herbaceous seed sources from plots with or without a shrub at their centre, designated 'shrub' or 'open', respectively. Seed rain was then sampled over a 7-month period, along four directions within a fine-scale radial sampling pattern from the shrub core to its periphery and in corresponding positions in the open plots. Seed predation was monitored likewise. 3. The overall abundance and species richness of herbaceous seeds were similar at all distances from the core in the open plots and at the shrub periphery, but lower under the shrub canopy. However, the observed patterns were clearly directional, with the highest seed abundance and species richness found on the upslope periphery of the shrub patch. 4. These patterns were observed after the elimination of all within-patch herbaceous seed sources, which suggests that the movement of seeds was mainly driven by gravity-related mechanisms whose effect was modified by the shrubs. 5. Synthesis. A shrub can function simultaneously as both a seed trap and a barrier to herbaceous seed flow, with the exact balance determined by location within the patch. Furthermore, whether the effect of the shrub on herbaceous seeds is regarded as facilitatory or competitive is scale-dependent. A mechanistic dissociation of seed dispersal from other processes modulated by the shrub in shaping the herbaceous community, as done in this study, is important for understanding the resilience of semi-arid and arid ecosystems to environmental changes, especially to the increasingly observed drought-induced mortality of shrubs associated with climate change.","[Giladi, Itamar; Segoli, Moran] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Ungar, Eugene D.] Agr Res Org, Dept Agron & Nat Resources, Inst Plant Sci, IL-50250 Bet Dagan, Israel","Giladi, I (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.",itushgi@bgu.ac.il,"Giladi, Itamar/N-3365-2016; Segoli, Moran/I-6624-2012","Giladi, Itamar/0000-0003-0240-7480; Segoli, Moran/0000-0002-9839-9843","James S.

Negative biotic interactions by resident species may prevent successful invaders from becoming pests. Few experimental data are available on the presence and significance of such biotic resistance other than predation or competition. This study addresses the role of habitat structure provided by a native eelgrass (Zostera marina) canopy on growth and survival of the non-indigenous mussel Musculista senhousia, a habitat-modifying gregarious suspension feeder with strong effects on native infauna and eelgrass. In 2 southern California bays, a series of transplantation experiments using tagged mussels revealed that inside an eelgrass canopy, Musculista growth rates were reduced by more than half in 3 of 4 experiments compared to adjacent unvegetated areas. Musculista survival also decreased inside the vegetation in a 4-mo experiment. As one element of habitat structure, we tested the effects of eelgrass parch size, using natural (1 site) and planted (1 site) eelgrass patches of defined sizes. Growth rates of Musculista were highest outside the veneration and decreased as eelgrass patch size increased. As a potential mechanism for the canopy effects, we suggest that Musculista receives less food inside the vegetation. In the experimental plots, the presence and spatial extent of the macrophyte canopy strongly affected near bottom (10 cm) horizontal water flow assessed with a direct dye tracking method. Reduced mussel growth rates were linearly associated with lower water flow, and presumably, food flux. Over a period of 7 mo, food resources (particulate chlorophyll a) were consistently lower 1 and 5 cm above the sea floor inside eelgrass patches compared to the sand Aat. The reduction in food availability matched the growth reduction of Musculista. Also, mussel condition (dry flesh mass/shell mass) was worse in individuals growing in eelgrass than in the sand Aat. Previous experiments revealed that dense beds of Musculista impede the rhizome growth and vegetative propagation of eelgrass, yet mussels attain abundances sufficient for interference only if eelgrass beds are patchy. Thus, anthropogenic disturbances on eelgrass beds, which often result in meadow fragmentation, and the proliferation of Musculista may have synergistic negative effects on the persistence of eelgrass beds.","San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA","Reusch, TBH (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Dept Marine Biol, PO Box 14,Biol Ctr,Kerklaan 30, NL-9750 AA Haren, Netherlands.",t.reusch@biol.rug.nl,"Reusch, Thorsten B.H./G-4141-2011; Reusch, Thorsten B.

These methods are popular in reintroduction programs because they can assist released individuals to adapt to novel environments. In situ management and reintroductions are being used to recover warru (black-footed rock-wallaby, Petrogale lateralis MacDonnell Ranges race) on the arid Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands of South Australia. Direct predation by introduced predators is thought to be the main cause of population decline, but indirect predation effects reducing access to water resources has also been proposed as a limiting factor. Aims To determine whether warru would use supplementary water and so provide a tool to alleviate resource pressure for in situ (wild) and reintroduced warru populations. Methods We provided supplementary water to a wild and reintroduced warru population across 12 months. Drinking rates were calculated by monitoring water points with camera traps and modelled against plant moisture content and total rainfall. We also examined whether number of visits to water points by warru predators and competitors was significantly different to control points (no water present). Key results Wild and reintroduced warru used water points within 0-10 days of installation. No significant increase in visits by predators or competitors was observed at water points. Drinking rates were significantly higher during dry winter months (March-October) for both wild and re-introduced populations. Conclusions Supplementary water is readily utilised by warru. Water could be provided in this manner to warru populations where predators are present, particularly during drier months (generally March-October on the APY Lands), periods of drought or after fire, when food resources will have a lower water content and/or be less abundant. This may increase breeding rates and recruitment of young, and improve the probability of persistence for populations of this threatened species, and should be further investigated. Implications Supplementary water provision may be a useful tool to increase population growth rates for threatened mammalian herbivores in arid habitats. Experimental trials of the uptake of supplementary water and effects on population dynamics will provide important data for implementing adaptive management frameworks for conservation.","[West, Rebecca] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [West, Rebecca] Univ New South Wales, POB 600, Broken Hill, NSW 2880, Australia; [Ward, Matthew J.] Nat Resources Alinytjara Wilurara, Dept Environm Water & Nat Resources, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Foster, Wendy K.] Royal Zool Soc South Australia, Frome Rd, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Taggart, David A.] Fauna Res Alliance Ltd, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia","West, R (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.; West, R (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, POB 600, Broken Hill, NSW 2880, Australia.",rebecca.west@unsw.edu.au,,,Warru Recovery Team; Norman Wettenhall Foundation; Margaret Middleton Fund; Sir Mark Mitchell Research Foundation; Nature Foundation SA; Adelaide Off Road,"Approvals to conduct the project were granted by the APY Executive Board, SA Department of Environment and Natural Resources Wildlife Ethics Committee (15/2007) and University of Adelaide Animal Ethics Committee (S-2011-9).

We used a playback experiment to examine the role of vocal loudness (i.e., sound pressure level) in sibling to sibling communication of nestling barn owls Tyto alba. In this species, siblings vocally negotiate among each other for priority access to parental food resources. Call rate and call duration play key roles in this vocal communication system, with the most vocal nestlings deterring their siblings from competing for access to the food item next delivered by parents. Here, we broadcast calls at different loudness levels and call rate to live nestlings. The loudness of playback calls did not affect owlets' investment in call rate, call duration or call loudness. The rate at which playback calls were broadcast affected owlets' call rate but did not influence their response in terms of loudness. This suggests that selection for producing loud signals may be weak in this species, as loud calls may attract predators. Moreover, given that owlets do not overlap their calls and that they communicate to nearby siblings in the silence of the night, loud signals may not be necessary to convey reliable information about food need.","[Dreiss, Amelie N.; Ducouret, Pauline; Ruppli, Charlene A.; Rossier, Virginie; Hernandez, Lucile; Roulin, Alexandre] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Rossier, Virginie] Univ Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Villetaneuse, France; [Hernandez, Lucile] Univ Bourgogne, Dijon, France; [Falourd, Xavier] PRONA, Yverdon, Switzerland; [Marmaroli, Patrick] CTN, HED Technol, Geneva, Switzerland; [Cazau, Dorian] CNRS, UMR 6285, Lab STICC, ENSTA Bretagne, Brest 09, France; [Lissek, Herve] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Signal Proc Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland","Dreiss, AN (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Lausanne, Switzerland.",amelie.n.dreiss@gmail.com,"Lissek, Herve/G-1451-2010","Lissek, Herve/0000-0002-0444-0535; Dreiss, Amelie/0000-0001-7154-4783",Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen ForschungAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [31003A-120517],"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: 31003A-120517",,33,2,2,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,JUN-JUL,2017,123,6-7,,,,,419,424,,10.1111/eth.12612,,,6,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,EX7UX,WOS:000403456000003,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, biological drivers like predation can also be important for community composition. Sea otters (Enhydra lutris ssp.) are a salient example of a keystone species exerting top-down control on ecosystem community structure. The translocation and subsequent population growth and range expansion of the northern sea otter (Enhydra lutris kenyoni) in Washington State over the last five decades has created a spatio-temporal gradient in sea otter occupation time and density, and acts as a natural experiment to quantify how sea otter population status and habitat type influence sea otter diet. We collected focal observations of sea otters foraging at sites across the gradient in varying habitat types between 2010 and 2017. We quantified sea otter diet composition and diversity, and long-term rates of energy gain across the gradient. We found that sea otter diet diversity was positively correlated with cumulative sea otter density, while rate of energy gain was negatively correlated with cumulative density. Additionally, we found that habitat type explained 1.77 times more variance in sea otter diet composition than sea otter cumulative density. Long-term diet studies can provide a broader picture of sea otter population status in Washington State.","[Hale, Jessica R.; Laidre, Kristin L.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 NE Boat St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Laidre, Kristin L.] Univ Washington, Polar Sci Ctr, Appl Phys Lab, 1013 NE 40th St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Tinker, M.

Experiments were carried out in 260-1 mesocosms set up outdoors in a forest. These pond simulations were designed to mimic conditions that occur in palustrine temporary wetlands in cen central Pennsylvania. No animals reached metamorphosis in the short hydroperiod (56 days). However a greater proportion (66%) of tadpoles of R. sylvatica survived to the end of the 56-day treatment than the 84- or 158-day treatments (29 and 14%, respectively), from which all survivors metamorphosed. In contrast, neither of the salamanders metamorphosed by 84 days; survival to metamorphosis at 158 days was 15% for A. jeffersonianum and 10% for A. maculatum. Average instantaneous growth rates for A. jeffersonianum decreased with each increase in hydroperiod. Growth of R. sylvatica was greater in the 56-day hydroperiod than in hydroperiods of 84 or 158 days. Initial amphibian density had no effect on growth or survival of any species. It appears that salamander larvae were predatory on tadpoles, since survival of R. sylvatica was negatively correlated with survival of A. jeffersonianum in 84-day treatments and with growth of A. maculatum in 158-day treatments.","PENN STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,UNIVERSITY PK,PA 16802",,,"Rowe, Christopher/D-5271-2012","Rowe, Christopher/0000-0001-9502-9225",,,,42,94,97,5,41,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1995,102,4,,,,,397,403,,10.1007/BF00341351,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RG164,WOS:A1995RG16400001,28306882,,,,2021-09-27,

Mechanistic definitions consider an animal's home range to be the spatial expression of a cognitive map that is kept up-to-date with the status of critical resources that contribute to animal fitness. We assumed there are two major determinants structuring the home range of cats as apex predators in insular ecosystems: the distribution of critical food resources and conspecific distribution. We hypothesized that cats structure their home ranges by optimizing the use of staple critical food resources and that as a consequence of the presence of rich resources cats tend to socialise, aggregate and share space. We carried out spatial analyses using location data for feral cats tracked using lightweight GPS collars in conjunction with the suitability value of rabbit patches and their associated ownership costs for cats within a New Zealand braided-river environment. Cat home ranges and spatial distribution, especially for females, were related to the inclusion of rabbit patches within home ranges with higher mean value than the average of neighbourhood patches in the landscape. Cats showed solitary behaviour but tolerance to conspecific presence by sharing high-use areas and high-value rabbit patches, mostly at different times, resulting in occasional encounters among males and females. Home range size and patterns of spatial overlap were dependant on sex and season. Solitary spacing patterns as consequence of innate preferences together with resource constraints may regulate feral cat population densities.","[Recio, Mariano R.] Univ Otago, Sch Surveying, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Recio, Mariano R.; Seddon, Philip J.] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand","Recio, MR (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Box 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.",mariano.recio@otago.ac.nz,"Seddon, Philip/G-8659-2011","Seddon, Philip/0000-0001-9076-9566; /0000-0002-9449-2952",Department of Zoology Research Grant; School of Surveying Research Funds (PBRF); University of Otago,We thank Richard Maloney and the Department of Conservation staff in Twizel for the logistic support; Simon Stevenson for the assistance in the field; Godley Peaks and Lylibank Station for access permission to their lands; Emilio Virgos for providing helpful discussions and assistance.

Our objective was to explore feeding strategies and potential competition with other top predators as ecosystem changes occur in the northern Bering Sea ecosystem. Our approach used stomach content data collected from field sampling during spring 2006 and 2007. Calanoid copepods and ampeliscid amphipods were important prey of Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) but in different proportions depending upon fish size, feeding location, and local environmental conditions. Snailfish (Liparidae) occupied a broad niche and fed on a variety of benthic amphipods. Arctic alligatorfish (Ulcina olrikii) and Arctic staghorn sculpin (Gymnocanthus tricuspis) consumed ampeliscid amphipods predominantly. Shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) had a less-diverse diet, with snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) most important by weight. Finally, all Bering flounder (Hippoglossoides robustus) sampled had empty stomachs. Our results indicate that ampeliscid amphipods, which have high biomass in the central region of the northern Bering Sea, are the most important prey for the dominant groundfish in the Chirikov Basin. Generally, all dominant benthic fish in the northern Bering Sea had narrow feeding niches, except snailfish. High diet overlap was found among many of the fish species, including Arctic cod and snailfish, snailfish and Arctic alligatorfish, and Arctic alligatorfish and Arctic staghorn sculpin. These findings are consistent with a relatively short food chain for benthic fish that are for the most part specialized feeders with narrow preferences for food and may be affected by changes in benthic prey distributions.","[Cui, Xuehua] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Grebmeier, Jacqueline M.; Cooper, Lee W.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Solomons, MD 20688 USA","Cui, XH (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 569 Dabney Hall,1416 Circle Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",cuixuehua@gmail.com,"Grebmeier, Jacqueline/L-9805-2013; Cooper, L.

In 2003 and 2004, insect captures were compared between pitfall traps baited with dung of untreated cattle and paired traps baited with dung of cattle that had been treated 7 days previously with topically applied doramectin, eprinomectin, ivermectin or moxidectin. Faecal residues associated with each compound affected insect captures in both spring and autumn of each year. Effects were detected (P < 0.05) for a total of 94 cases representing 27 insect taxa from 13 families in three orders (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera). Two-fold differences in captures were common. Up to six-fold differences were observed. Eleven cases of attraction and 11 cases of repellency were associated with residues of doramectin. Eprinomectin tended to repel insects, with decreased captures for 19 of 29 cases of effect. Ivermectin showed a strong attractive effect, with increased captures for 17 of 25 cases. Moxidectin also showed a strong attractive effect, with increased captures for 17 of 18 cases. Comparisons between compounds suggested that results for doramectin best predicted results for eprinomectin and vice versa. In 2005, insect captures were compared between pitfall traps baited with dung of untreated cattle and traps baited with dung from cattle treated 3, 7 or 14 days previously with topically applied doramectin. Effects were detected in 14 cases plus one case of near significance (P = 0.053). Significant differences between control vs. days 3, 7 and/or 14 dung were detected in nine cases. Residues enhanced captures in seven of these cases. Day 14 dung affected captures in six of these cases. This study shows that endectocide residues can affect the number of insects attracted to colonize and oviposit in dung. Hence, the emergence of their offspring from field-colonized dung of untreated vs. endectocide-treated cattle should not be used as a measure of residue toxicity per se, but rather as a measure of 'insect activity'. Insect activity is a composite measure of residue toxicity, the number and species composition of insect colonists, and the mortality factors (e.g. predation, parasitism, competition) associated with the co-occurrence of these species in the dung pat.","[Floate, K.

Some exploit resources and protection provided by close proximity to people, while others learn to avoid people all together. In this study, we sought to test whether individuals from a population of eastern grey kangaroos altered grouping and spacing behaviour in response to human presence, depending upon whether the intent and actions of those people were benign or harmful. Under harmful conditions, kangaroos failed to form larger groups when far from cover, however, this typical antipredator grouping behaviour persisted when human disturbances were benign. These differences in grouping and spacing behaviour suggest that kangaroos can exhibit bidirectional behavioural plasticity at fine scales, a trait that may confer adaptive advantages when sharing landscapes with humans. Abstract Sharing landscapes with humans is an increasingly fraught challenge for wildlife across the globe. While some species benefit from humans by exploiting novel opportunities (e.g., provision of resources or removal of competitors or predators), many wildlife experience harmful effects, either directly through persecution or indirectly through loss of habitat. Consequently, some species have been shown to be attracted to human presence while others avoid us. For any given population of a single species, though, the question of whether they can recognise and change their response to human presence depending on the type of human actions (i.e., either positive or negative) has received little attention to date. In this study, we chose to examine the behavioural plasticity within a single population of eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) to both positive and negative human activity. Within a relatively small and contiguous landscape, we identified areas where kangaroos experience a combination of either low and high frequencies of benign and harmful human disturbances. From six sampling sessions over five months, we found that density and group sizes were higher where humans acted benignly towards them, and that these groups had higher representations of sub-adults and juveniles than where humans had harmful intentions. Importantly, we found that the vital antipredator strategy of increasing group size with distance from cover was not detectable at sites with low and high levels of harm. Our findings suggest that these kangaroos are recognising and adjusting their behavioural response to humans at fine spatial scales, a plasticity trait that may be key to the survival of these species in human dominated landscapes.","[Austin, Caitlin M.; Ramp, Daniel] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Sci, Ctr Compassionate Conservat, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia","Austin, CM (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Sci, Ctr Compassionate Conservat, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",Caitlin.Austin@uts.edu.au; Daniel.Ramp@uts.edu.au,"Ramp, Daniel/C-3692-2008","Ramp, Daniel/0000-0003-3202-9898",Detroit Zoological Society; UTS Postgraduate Research Scholarship,This project was funded by Detroit Zoological Society and C.M.A was supported by a UTS Postgraduate Research Scholarship.,,75,4,4,1,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,MAY,2019,9,5,,,,,,,244,10.3390/ani9050244,,,16,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences",Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences,IC4UY,WOS:000470963400048,31096679,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-27,

Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni are the most common Campylobacter species associated with this disease. These pathogens live in the intestinal tract of most avian species and under commercial conditions they spread rapidly to infect a high proportion of the flock, which makes their treatment and prevention very difficult. Bacteriophages (phages) are naturally occurring predators of bacteria with high specificity and also the capacity to evolve to overcome bacterial resistance. Therefore phage therapy is a promising alternative to antibiotics in animal production. This study tested the efficacy of a phage cocktail composed of three phages for the control of poultry infected with C. coli and C. jejuni. Moreover, it evaluated the effectiveness of two routes of phage administration (by oral gavage and in feed) in order to provide additional information regarding their future use in a poultry unit. Results: The results indicate that experimental colonisation of chicks was successful and that the birds showed no signs of disease even at the highest dose of Campylobacter administered. The phage cocktail was able to reduce the titre of both C. coli and C. jejuni in faeces by approximately 2 log(10) cfu/g when administered by oral gavage and in feed. This reduction persisted throughout the experimental period and neither pathogen regained their former numbers. The reduction in Campylobacter titre was achieved earlier (2 days post-phage administration) when the phage cocktail was incorporated in the birds' feed. Campylobacter strains resistant to phage infection were recovered from phage-treated chickens at a frequency of 13%. These resistant phenotypes did not exhibit a reduced ability to colonize the chicken guts and did not revert to sensitive types. Conclusions: Our findings provide further evidence of the efficacy of phage therapy for the control of Campylobacter in poultry. The broad host range of the novel phage cocktail enabled it to target both C. jejuni and C. coli strains. Moreover the reduction of Campylobacter by approximately 2 log(10)cfu/g, as occurred in our study, could lead to a 30-fold reduction in the incidence of campylobacteriosis associated with consumption of chicken meals (according to mathematical models). To our knowledge this is the first report of phage being administered in feed to Campylobacter-infected chicks and our results show that it lead to an earlier and more sustainable reduction of Campylobacter than administration by oral gavage. Therefore the present study is of extreme importance as it has shown that administering phages to poultry via the food could be successful on a commercial scale.","[Carvalho, Carla M.; Santos, Silvio B.; Azeredo, Joana] Univ Minho, Ctr Biol Engn, IBB Inst Biotechnol & Bioengn, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Gannon, Ben W.; Halfhide, Deborah E.; Hayes, Christine M.; Roe, John M.] Univ Bristol, Dept Vet Clin Sci, Langford BS40 5DU, North Somerset, England","Azeredo, J (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Ctr Biol Engn, IBB Inst Biotechnol & Bioengn, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",jazeredo@deb.uminho.pt,"Santos, Silvio/O-5491-2015; Azeredo, Joana/A-2084-2012","Santos, Silvio/0000-0003-0801-8080; Azeredo, Joana/0000-0002-5180-7133; Carvalho, Carla/0000-0002-9345-6546","European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [FP-6-2003 Food-2-A, 2005-7224]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/23484/2005]",The authors acknowledge the European Commission under the FP-6-2003 Food-2-A to the project 2005-7224 for the financial support and the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) through the grant SFRH/BD/23484/2005.

Using a combination of time-series analysis of population counts recorded over 16 Sears and experimental data, we present the first estimates of the relative roles of top-down and bottom-up forces on the population dynamics of two terrestrial insect herbivores on the English oak (Quercus robur). Data suggest that temporal variation in winter moth, Operophtera brumata, density is dominated by time-lagged effects of pupal predators, By comparison, spatial variation in O. brumata density is dominated by host-plant quality. Overall, top-down forces explain 34.2% of population variance, bottom-up forces explain 17.2% of population variance, and 48.6% remains unexplained. In contrast, populations of the green oak tortrix, Tortrix viridana, appear dominated by bottom-up forces, Re: source limitation, expressed as intraspecific competition among larvae for oak leaves, explains 29.4% of population variance. Host quality effects explain an additional 5.7% of population variance, Wc detected no major top-down effects on T. viridana populations. An unknown factor causing a linear decline in T. viridana populations over the 16-year study period accounts for most of the remaining unexplained variance, We discuss the observed differences between the insect species and the utility of time-series analysis as a tool in assessing the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up forces on herbivore populations.",,"Hunter, MD (corresponding author), UNIV GEORGIA,INST ECOL,ATHENS,GA 30602, USA.",,,"Hunter, Mark/0000-0003-3761-8237",,,,32,117,127,0,62,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Simple theoretical analyses predict multiple stable states for (1) single species dynamics via the Allee effect, (2) two-species competitive interactions characterized by unstable coexistence, (3) some predator-prey interactions, and (4) some systems combining predation and competition. Potential examples of transitions between stable states on reefs include the failure of Diadema antillarum and Acropora cervicornis to recover following catastrophic mortality, and the replacement of microalgal turf by unpalatable macroalgae after rapid increase in the amount of substratum available for colonization by algae. Subtidal marine ecosystems in general, and reefs in particular, have several attributes which favor the existence of multiple stable states. Studies of transitions between states often need to rely upon poorly controlled, unreplicated natural ''experiments,'' as transitions typically require pulses of disturbance over very large spatial scales. The stability of a state must often be inferred from analyses of the dynamics of participants at that state, as generation times and the potential for further extrinsic disturbance preclude the use of persistence as an indicator of stability. The potential for multiple stable states strongly influences our interpretation of variability in space and time and our ability to predict reef responses to natural and man-made environmental change.",,"KNOWLTON, N (corresponding author), SMITHSONIAN TROP RES INST, APARTADO 2072, BALBOA, PANAMA.",,,,,,,45,393,404,1,98,SOC INTEGRATIVE COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY,MCLEAN,"1313 DOLLEY MADISON BLVD, NO 402, MCLEAN, VA 22101 USA",0003-1569,,,AM ZOOL,Am.

We collected data on strata and substrate use during foraging, on prey searching and capturing, and on prey type of two C. cupreus groups and one group each of S. mystax and S. fuscicollas during a 5-month field study in northeastern Peruvian Amazonia. Our results showed that C. cupreus differed both from S. mystax and S. fuscicollis in prey capture strategies: (1) C. cupreus used lower forest. strata for prey search and capture than S. mystax and higher forest strata than S. fuscicollis. (2) C. cupreus captured prey on a higher variety of substrates than S. mystax and more often on open microhabitats compared to S. fuscicollis. (3) C. cupreus captured prey more often directly than S. mystax and rarely by manual search, in contrast to S. fuscicollis. (4) C. cupreus fed exclusively on arthropods and focused on Hymenoptera in contrast to both tamarin species that focused on Orthoptera and included vertebrates in their diet.

Den site selection is often based on fitness related criteria like escape from predators, food availability and shelter from extreme weather conditions. African wild dogs are cooperative breeders that use a den to give birth to their offspring. They often co-exist with lions and spotted hyenas, both of which are known to kill African wild dog pups. Little is known about den site selection by African wild dogs. In this study, we compared vegetation characteristics and distribution of roads and waterholes around den sites and random sites, in areas with high and low lion and spotted hyena densities. In both areas, African wild dogs selected den sites in closed woodland with little visibility, which is likely to reduce detection by predators, increase the likelihood of escape when detected, and might provide shelter from extreme weather conditions. In the high predator density area, African wild dogs seemed to spatially avoid predators by selecting den sites in this type of habitat relatively further away from waterholes and roads. African wild dogs have high energetic costs of gestation. Therefore, even when predation risk is relatively low, they are likely to try to maximise their fitness by choosing a den site in habitat that will provide optimal protection for their offspring, leaving little additional options to respond to a higher predation pressure.

A few empirical studies included the effect of prey abundance when investigating simultaneously the effects of density-dependence and climate factors on marine top-predator population dynamics. Our aim was to unravel the mechanisms forcing population dynamics of an apex consumer seabird, the south polar skua, using long-term climatic and population time series of the consumer and its prey in Terre Adelie, Antarctica. Influences of density-dependence, climatic factors, and prey abundance with lag effects were tested on the breeding population dynamics with a Bayesian multi-model inference approach. We evidenced a negative trend in breeding population growth rate when density increased. Lagged effects of sea-ice concentration and air temperature in spring and a contemporary effect of prey resources were supported. Remarkably, results outline a reverse response of the south polar skua and one of its main preys to the same environmental factor (sea-ice concentration), suggesting a strong link between skua and penguin dynamics. The causal mechanisms may involve competition for food and space through territorial behavior as well as local climate and prey availability, which probably operate on breeding parameters (breeding propensity, breeding success, or recruitment) rather than on adult survival. Our results provide new insights on the relative importance of factors forcing the population dynamics of an apex consumer including density-dependence, local climate conditions, and direct and indirect effects of prey abundance.","[Pacoureau, Nathan; Delord, Karine; Barbraud, Christophe] CNRS, UMR 7372, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiersen En Bois, France; [Authier, Matthieu] Univ La Rochelle, CNRS, UMS 3462, Observ PELAGIS, Allee 4 Ocean, F-17000 La Rochelle, France","Pacoureau, N (corresponding author), CNRS, UMR 7372, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiersen En Bois, France.",n.pacoureau@gmail.com,"Barbraud, Christophe/A-5870-2012","Barbraud, Christophe/0000-0003-0146-212X; Authier, Matthieu/0000-0001-7394-1993",French Polar Institute IPEV [109]; Terres Australes et Antarctiques Francaises; Zone Atelier Antarctique et Subantarctique (CNRS-INEE),"We thank all the field workers involved in Terre Adelie for collecting the population data on south polar skuas and penguins.

Contrary to our expectation we found abundant populations with densities up to 72 ind.m(-2). The individuals grew slowly over four years with no replacement in the smaller size classes. In the short term, presence of A. stellifera negatively impacted the abundance of all macrobenthic species analyzed, including sessile and moving animals and algae. We demonstrate that this sea star feeds in a non-selective way on several items belonging to different trophic levels. In addition, it displays a microphagous feeding behavior, so its direct impact might extend to settlers, modifying the recruitment of benthic populations. Indirect effects were not detected, likely due to the experiments lasting for a very short period. As an abundant omnivore, A. stellifera is likely affecting the stability of trophic webs of which they are part. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the risk of eavesdropping by unintended receivers means there is also a potential cost to any vocalization. For fugitive species such as African wild dogs the potential cost of attracting dangerous competitors as eavesdroppers is especially significant. Experiments presented here demonstrate that eavesdropping lions Panthera leo were highly motivated to approach playbacks of wild dog Lycaon pictus vocalizations. As lions will kill any wild dogs they can catch, wild dogs risk paying high costs should their calls be detected. Lions were less likely to approach playbacks of spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta whoops, with responses split according to gender: male lions remained quick to approach hyena whoops, but females without accompanying males typically did not approach. Although hyenas seemed at least as capable as lions of detecting playbacks of wild dog calls, they were significantly less likely to subsequently approach them. Analogous to female lions faced with hyenas, the reluctance of hyenas to approach wild dogs may well derive from an assessment of the potential risks involved. We consider the hypothesis that wild dog twitters display counter-adaptations against eavesdropping, but suggest that this species may best limit the risk of detection by avoiding areas where they are most likely to be overheard by lions.","[Webster, Hugh] Univ Sussex, Dept Psychol, Ctr Mammal Vocal Commun Res, Sch Psychol, Brighton BN1 9QH, E Sussex, England; [Webster, Hugh; McNutt, John W.] Botswana Predator Conservat Program, Maun, Botswana","Webster, H (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Dept Psychol, Ctr Mammal Vocal Commun Res, Sch Psychol, Brighton BN1 9QH, E Sussex, England.",hughwebster1@googlemail.com,,,"Botswana Predator Conservation Program, San Diego Zoo, Philadelphia Zoo; University of Sussex; BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BBS/S/K/2004/11263]","We thank the Botswana Government and Department of Wildlife and National Parks for permission to conduct the research.

This insight motivates the study of 'Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics' or how evolution and ecological processes reciprocally interact on short time scales. We tested how rapid evolution impacts concurrent population dynamics using an aphid (Myzus persicae) and an undomesticated host (Hirschfeldia incana) in replicated wild populations. We manipulated evolvability by creating non-evolving (single clone) and potentially evolving (two-clone) aphid populations that contained genetic variation in intrinsic growth rate. We observed significant evolution in two-clone populations whether or not they were exposed to predators and competitors. Evolving populations grew up to 42% faster and attained up to 67% higher density, compared with non-evolving control populations but only in treatments exposed to competitors and predators. Increased density also correlates with relative fitness of competing clones suggesting a full eco-evolutionary dynamic cycle defined as reciprocal interactions between evolution and density.","[Turcotte, Martin M.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada; [Reznick, David N.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Hare, J.

How animals balance growth deficits and growth compensation is predicted to depend on the effects of each on lifetime fitness. We investigated the effects of experimental early-life food restriction on growth, body condition, and adult contest competition in a cichlid fish (Tropheus sp.). Their longevity and aseasonal breeding suggest that, with view on lifetime reproductive success, temporarily growth-restricted Tropheus should rather invest extra time in reaching competitive body size than risk the potential costs of accelerated growth. However, size-selective predation pressure by gape size-limited piscivores may have favored the evolution of an accelerated growth response to early-life delays. Experimentally food-restricted fish temporarily reduced their growth rate compared to a control group, but maintained their body condition factor at the control level throughout the 80-week study period. There was no evidence for an accelerated growth response following the treatment, as the food-restricted fish never exceeded the size-specific growth rates that were measured in the control group. Food-restricted fish caught up with the body size of the control group several months after the end of the treatment period and were as likely as control fish to win size-matched contests over territories. Regardless of feeding regime, there were sex-specific differences in growth rates and in the trajectories of condition factors over time. Females grew more slowly than males but maintained their condition factors at a high level throughout the study period, whereas the males' condition factors declined over time. These differences may reflect sex-specific contributions of condition and body size to adult fitness that are associated with female mouthbrooding and male competition for breeding territories.","[Ziegelbecker, Angelika; Sefc, Kristina M.] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Biol, Univ Pl 2, A-8010 Graz, Austria","Sefc, KM (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Biol, Univ Pl 2, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",kristina.sefc@uni-graz.at,,"Sefc, Kristina/0000-0001-8108-8339",Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [P28505-B25],"Austrian Science Fund, Grant/Award Number: P28505-B25",,72,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

More first juveniles were cannibalised at higher initial densities, and there was no effect on this cannibalism from offering different prey species. Although in their natural environment spiderlings may more readily evade one another, this terrarium experiment demonstrates the drastic effect of juvenile cannibalism. Larger first juveniles are apparently more prevalent among the cannibals, and juvenile cannibalism among similar sized spiderlings is less frequent. Prey sharing observed between similar sized first juveniles is not a social behaviour, but is rather a forced prey sharing resulting from competition among equally strong juveniles that are unable to defend their prey items from one another.

Many red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) that reside on federal lands occur on 15 military installations in the southeastern United States. This close association has increased concern over potential conflicts between conservation requirements of endangered species and the military's mission of combat readiness. Our objectives were to 1) determine if military training operations affect behavior, reproductive success, and productivity of red-cockaded woodpeckers; 2) develop a frequency-weighting function to assess woodpecker hearing sensitivity; 3) identify factors that affect woodpecker responses to military training operations; 4) develop distance and dose-response thresholds for quantifying woodpecker responses to noise levels and stimulus distances; 5) characterize military training operations through quantification of sound levels, source identification, distance from active woodpecker nests, frequency spectra, duration, and frequency of occurrence; and 6) document baseline woodpecker nesting behavior. We conducted our study on the Fort Stewart Military Installation located in southeast Georgia, USA. Downy woodpeckers, as surrogates for red-cockaded woodpeckers, had their best hearing sensitivity within the peak range of the power spectrum of both downy and red-cockaded woodpecker vocalizations, which is at a higher frequency than that of a typical passerine. Overall, woodpeckers had a reduced auditory sensitivity relative to human hearing sensitivity and other species of small birds, especially in the frequency range >4 kHz. Woodpeckers were most sensitive in the 1.5- to 4.0-kHz range. Sensitivity appeared to drop off quickly at frequencies <1.0 kHz and >4.0 kHz. Overall, we did not find that the woodpecker-frequency-weighting function we developed provided a better predictor of woodpecker flush response compared with A-weighting. More research is needed to better understand the relationship between frequency-weighting functions and woodpecker response behavior. Potential breeding groups of woodpeckers across the population increased from 158 in 1997 to 181 in 2000, wheras nesting groups increased from 141 in 1998 to 170 in 2000, for overall increases of 14.6% and 20.6%, respectively, over the 3 years of this project. Fledging success rates for individual nests within the overall population remained consistent from 1998 to 2000, averaging 84.4%. Mean clutch sizes for woodpecker groups for 1998 to 2000 ranged from 2.75 to 3.01 eggs/nest, brood size ranged from 2.01 to 2.22 nestlings/nest, whereas the average number of young fledged ranged from 1.57 to 1.76 young/occupied nest. We observed no difference in reproductive success or productivity between experimental and control-tested red-cockaded woodpecker groups. Overall, experimental test groups produced an average of 2.98 eggs/nest, 1.89 nestlings/nest, and 1.54 young/occupied nest from 1999 to 2000, compared with 2.73 eggs/nest, 1.91 nestlings/nest, and 1.57 young/occupied nest at control groups. We measured behavioral responses (nest attendance and arrivals and departures from the nest) of red-cockaded woodpeckers to military training events through direct and indirect (i.e., video surveillance) observation of 464. 5 hours of woodpecker nesting behavior before and after controlled experimental events while recording and characterizing militry-generated sound events using sound-recording equipment. We presented woodpeckers with actual 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators from controlled distances to develop distance and sound thresholds. We used video surveillance to document potential behavioral responses of woodpeckers primarily during nonexperimental military training operations in areas that could not be safely monitored and to determine baseline woodpecker nesting behaviors. We recorded 2,846 nonexperimental military noise events in 157 data sessions at 50 red-cockaded woodpecker groups from 1998 to 2000. We also recorded 206 experimental tests at 58 woodpecker groups during 1999 and 2000. Life-table analyses of flush response time showed that at short ranges (15-30 m) the flush response was stronger for artillery simulator blasts than for blank fire in both the incubation and the nestling phases. In contrast, at medium distances (45-60 m) blank fire tended to produce more flush responses than artillery fire in both incubation and nestling phases. At longer distances (>60 m), blank fire and artillery produced similar flush responses in the incubation phase, whereas flush response was stronger for blank fire than for artillery in the nestling phase. In general, most animals that responded to military activity flushed within 5 seconds of the stimulus event. Woodpeckers returned to nests within an average of 4.4 minutes after being flushed by artillery simulators and 6.3 minutes after 0.50-caliber blank-fire tests. Woodpecker flush response rates increased as stimulus distance decreased and sound levels increased, regardless of stimulus type or year. Woodpeckers did not flush from nests when 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators were >152 m away and sound-exposure levels (decibels [dB]) were <68 dBW (woodpecker-based frequency-weighting curve) and <65 dBW, respectively. We found that blast treatments reduced arrival rates of adults at the nest, with the amount of reduction dependent on the type of blast stimulus and number of helpers at the nest. On the other hand, blast treatments had no detectable effects on nest attendance. The effect of blank fire on incubation-phase arrivals over a 30-minute interval (about 40% reduction) was nearly twice that of artillery simulator fire (about a 20% reduction). There was no evidence supporting any effect of stimulus type on arrivals during the nestling phase. Blast stimuli during incubation reduced arrivals by 40% when no helpers were present, but the strength of this effect decreased to 28% when one helper was present, and was only 6% for nests with >= 2 helpers. Distance of the blast from the nest did not affect the response of arrival rates to blast treatments. Infrequent, short-duration military training exercises, as measured, did not appear to substantially impact red-cockaded woodpecker reproductive success and productivity on the Fort Stewart Military Installation. Our results may be applicable to other military installations where similar training activities and intensity levels occur. Additional research is needed to address possible habituation or sensitization of red-cockaded woodpeckers to human activities in proximity to active nest sites. Although we attempted to monitor woodpecker response to a number of military training activities, other types of military training operations or human-based activities with louder noise, longer duration, incrased human presence, and greater frequency of occurrence could more negatively influence woodpecker nesting behavior and need to be investigated. Our results do not support the hypothesis that military maneuver training operations are limiting factors in the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers on military installations, based on our level and type of testing. Natural resource management policies on military installations have had a positive influence on the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers and probably outweigh the negative effects of typical military training.

The thermal bar is a zone of sinking 4 degrees C water that separates warmer inshore water from colder offshore water. The thermal bar migrates offshore as inshore water warms. The density of Mysis did not differ statistically between inshore (about 6 degrees C, as shallow as 17 m bottom depth) and offshore of the spring thermal bar, but the percentage of Mysis that were juveniles (<10 mm length) was significantly higher inshore (P = 0.011). Our data suggested that inshore Mysis may have an advantage in growth, but an impact on the entire population is unlikely. This study has important implications for both the predators and competitors of Mysis. First, the thermal bar period may be the most extended time that M. diluviana and the invasive Hemimysis anomala overlap spatially. Second, at the only well-studied Great Lakes lake trout nursery, a Lake Superior shallow reef, juvenile Mysis are important prey for lake trout fry (Salvelinus namaycush) which emerge and begin feeding in spring. Our study shows that Mysis are often abundant in coastal Lake Michigan water during the period when the lake begins to warm. Hence, lake trout restoration efforts for coastal spawning areas of the other Great Lakes may have potential Mysis-based nursery grounds essentially on site, at or adjacent to spawning reefs.

The impact of single or few particular parameters in concert was often assessed in laboratory and mesocosm experiments. However, under natural conditions, with many biotic and abiotic factors potentially interacting, outcomes on phenotypic changes may be different. To study the potential environmental impact on realized phenotypic plasticity within a natural population, we assessed metamorphic traits (developmental time, size and body mass) in an amphibian species, the European common frog Rana temporaria, since a) larval amphibians are known to exhibit high levels of phenotypic plasticity of these traits in response to habitat parameters and, b) the traits' features may strongly influence individuals' future performance and fitness. In 2007 we studied these metamorphic traits in 18 ponds spread over an area of 28 km 2. A subset of six ponds was reinvestigated in 2009 and 2010. This study revealed locally high variances in metamorphic traits in this presumed generalist species. We detected profound differences between metamorphing froglets (up to factor ten); both between and within ponds, on a very small geographic scale. Parameters such as predation and competition as well as many other pond characteristics, generally expected to have high impact on development, could not be related to the trait differences. We observed high divergence of patterns of mass at metamorphosis between ponds, but no detectable pattern when metamorphic traits were compared between ponds and years. Our results indicate that environment alone, i.e. as experienced by tadpoles sharing the same breeding pond, can only partly explain the variability of metamorphic traits observed. This emphasizes the importance to assess variability of reaction norms on the individual level to explain within-population variability.","[Groezinger, Franziska] Univ Wurzburg, Theodor Boveri Inst, Bioctr, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol Zool 3, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Groezinger, Franziska; Roedel, Mark-Oliver] Museum Nat Kunde Berlin, Leibniz Inst Res Evolut & Biodivers, Berlin, Germany; [Thein, Juergen] Buro Faunist & Umweltbildung, Hassfurt, Germany; [Feldhaar, Heike] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Bayreuth, Germany; [Groezinger, Franziska; Roedel, Mark-Oliver] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, Berlin, Germany","Rodel, MO (corresponding author), Museum Nat Kunde Berlin, Leibniz Inst Res Evolut & Biodivers, Berlin, Germany.",mo.roedel@mfn-berlin.de,"Feldhaar, Heike/AAB-8678-2020","Feldhaar, Heike/0000-0001-6797-5126",Cusanuswerk Bischofliche Studienforderung,"FG was supported by a scholarship of Cusanuswerk Bischofliche Studienforderung'' (http://www.cusanuswerk.de/de/startseite/bischoeflichestudienfoerderung/).The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",,90,15,15,0,44,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,MAR 5,2014,9,3,,,,,,,e89982,10.1371/journal.pone.0089982,,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,AC4GP,WOS:000332479400038,24599256,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2021-09-27,

As such, the quantitative results from such studies may often underestimate the lethality of certain toxic compounds. A well-known example of this concept is illustrated by the marked increase in the lethality of pesticides when larval amphibians are concurrently exposed to the odor of potential predators. Here, we investigated the interaction between background levels of environmental predation risk (high vs. low) and ocean acidification (ambient vs. elevated CO2) in 2 x 2 design. Wild-caught juvenile damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, were exposed in the laboratory to the different risk and CO2 conditions for 4 days and released onto coral reef patches. Using a well-established field assay, we monitored the in situ behavior and mortality of the damselfish for 2 days. We predicted that juvenile fish exposed to elevated CO2 and high-risk conditions would display more severe behavioral impairments and increased mortality compared to fish exposed to elevated CO2 maintained under low-risk conditions. As expected, elevated CO2 exposure led to impaired antipredator responses and increased mortality in low-risk fish compared to ambient CO2 controls. However, we failed to find an effect of elevated CO2 on the behavior and survival of the high-risk fish. We hypothesized that the results may stem from either a behavioral compensation or a physiological response to high risk. Our results provide insights into the interactive nature of environmental and natural stressors and advance our understanding of the predicted effect of ocean acidification on aquatic ecosystems.","[Ferrari, Maud C.

The study site was the PrA(3)-Mata Research and Nature Conservation Center, a private reserve in southern Brazil. The climate is classified as Temperate Superhumid, with no dry season. We sampled three temporary and three permanent ponds. We compared the richness of tadpole assemblages of permanent and temporary ponds through individual-based rarefaction curves, and tested for possible differences using a MANOVA test. Tadpole richness was related to temporal environmental descriptors through General Regression Model. Relationships between the tadpole assemblages and possible predictors of their spatial variation were measured using a partial Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Analysis of rarefaction curves indicated higher expected richness for the temporary ponds. The mean values of richness were significantly different between the two hydroperiods across all months. Monthly richness showed the same tendency of variation for both pond types. Only temperature was related to tadpole richness. The pCCA analysis was significant. The most important predictors on the first pCCA axis were vegetation cover, conductivity, depth, and predator diversity. In this study, vegetation cover, conductivity, predator diversity, and water depth explained the spatial variation of tadpoles between ponds, with tadpole richness and diversity being higher in temporary than in permanent ponds. Our results suggest that different spatial-seasonal patterns operating in temporary and permanent ponds are related to maintaining the species diversity of pond-breeding anurans.","[Both, Camila] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Sole, Mirco] Univ Estadual Santa Cruz, Programa Posgrad Zool, Ilheus, Brazil; [dos Santos, Tiago Gomes] Univ Estadual Paulista, Programa Posgrad Zool, Rio Claro, Brazil; [Cechin, Sonia Zanini] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Programa Pos Grad Biodiversidade Anim, BR-97119900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil","Both, C (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",camilaboth@gmail.com,"Both, Camila/I-3656-2013; Cechin, Sonia T.

Here, we focussed on how complexity of artificial habitat (plastic plants), in microcosms, influenced short-term processes driven by three aquatic detritivores. The effects of habitat complexity on leaf decomposition, production of fine organic matter and pH levels were explored by measuring complexity in three ways: 1. as the presence vs. absence of habitat structure; 2. as the amount of structure (3 or 4.5 g of plastic plants); and 3. as the spatial configuration of structures (measured as fractal dimension). The experiment also addressed potential interactions among the consumers by running all possible species combinations. In the experimental microcosms, habitat complexity influenced how species performed, especially when comparing structure present vs. structure absent. Treatments with structure showed higher fine particulate matter production and lower pH compared to treatments without structures and this was probably due to higher digestion and respiration when structures were present. When we explored the effects of the different complexity levels, we found that the amount of structure added explained more than the fractal dimension of the structures. We give a detailed overview of the experimental design, statistical models and R codes, because our statistical analysis can be applied to other study systems (and disciplines such as restoration ecology). We further make suggestions of how to optimise statistical power when artificially assembling, and analysing, 'habitat complexity' by not confounding complexity with the amount of structure added.

The study of the stressful effects of human disturbances on animal distribution, physiology and behaviour can provide fundamental insights for wildlife conservation. Here, we assess how two declining birds, the European RollerCoracias garrulusand the European Scops OwlOtus scops,cope with alteration by human activities in farming habitats of the south of Spain. We studied nest distribution, quantified nestling physiology (corticosterone levels in plasma and feathers and body weight close to fledgling) and parental behaviour (feeding rates) of both species along a human alteration gradient. Rollers and Scops Owls used the same type of habitat and their spatial distribution was not determined by individual quality. In Rollers, nestlings raised in scrubland areas had high stress-induced corticosterone levels, possibly due to high predation risk in this habitat. In addition, Rollers and Scops Owls showed opposite relationships with farming activity and human disturbance. Nestling Rollers showed the highest corticosterone levels in feathers, weight and parental feeding rates in areas with intense farming activity. These results suggest that despite the disturbance produced by farming activities, inducing a higher stress in these areas, cultivated areas may, simultaneously, provide parents with a higher abundance of prey which would trigger increased feeding rates and, hence, higher nestling weights. Furthermore, nestling Scops Owls showed the highest stress-induced corticosterone levels in areas close to roads, suggesting that they would be affected by human disturbance due to infrastructures that disturb also at night when Scops Owls are active. Therefore, susceptibility to human disturbance may vary between species, probably due to variation in the daily pattern of human activities and the species' activity rhythm, buffering or exacerbating the effects, which should be considered in future studies on human alterations and birds.","[Exposito-Granados, Monica; Parejo, Deseada; Aviles, Jesus M.] CSIC, EEZA, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Almeria, Spain; [Parejo, Deseada] Univ Extremadura, Dept Zool, Badajoz, Spain; [Chastel, Olivier] CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, Route La Canauderie, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France","Exposito-Granados, M (corresponding author), CSIC, EEZA, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Almeria, Spain.",moexposit@gmail.com,"Exposito-Granados, Monica/K-1863-2019","Exposito-Granados, Monica/0000-0002-7996-2469","Spanish Ministry of Education and Science/FEDERSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2011-27561/BOS, CGL2014-56769-P]; Government of Extremadura [TA13002]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2012-051898, EEBB-I-14-08409]","We thank Olga Corona for helping in NAbs assays at the Estacion Experimental de Zonas aridas (EEZA-CSIC).

The book's publication coincided with the early years of transport deregulation in the United States, but predated recognition in the transport sector of the significant distinction between competition in the market and for the market. It did not therefore consider whether fluctuations between the domination of administration and that of free market forms, and between public and private sector responsibility for production of major utilities. were inherently perennial or whether there was a potential stable long term combination of public role as procurer and private sector role as supplier of these public utility services. This paper addresses that question in the context of two decades of experience of regulatory reform in the field of bus transport in developing and transitional economics as well as in industrialized countries. It analyzes a number of drivers of the cycle, including the adaptive, self-seeking behavior of suppliers and unrealistic aspirations of politicians, which ensure that stability will be hard to achieve, and concludes by setting out the structural and institutional requirements for a more robust and stable regulatory outcome.

The purpose of this article is to show how recent theoretical advances may reverse this situation. We first discuss four issues that have arisen in the development of theory for biological control. (1) Recent work has clarified and resolved earlier disagreements concerning the effect of aggregation of the parasitoid to local host density on the stability of parasitoid-host models; this work emphasizes that such aggregation increases the ability of the parasitoid to reduce pest density, (2) There has been disagreement over the conditions under which stability, in the mathematical sense and on a local spatial scale, is an appropriate goal for classical biological control of insect pests, and whether a metapopulation may sometimes provide a more appropriate framework. We also comment on (3) relative size of refuges, which has been proposed as a unifying concept, and (4) density dependence and ratio dependence. We then discuss recent models using a stage-structured approach, particularly those that compare potential biological control agents or agents that have been differentially successful in practice. We argue that this approach has already produced valuable insights into the factors operating in several field situations. It demonstrates the importance of identifying which pest stages are most injurious to the crop, since the natural enemy that wins in competition may not be the most effective at suppressing the crucial pest stage(s): in general, the winning parasitoid reduces the density of the host stage attacked by its competitor below the level at which the latter can maintain a positive growth rate when at low density. A useful criterion is that pest equilibrium density is suppressed most by the parasitoid species that needs the fewest host individuals to allow a female parasitoid to replace herself in the next generation. Caveats are that this may apply only under equilibrium conditions and that the pest stage most suppressed is the one we wish to control. We discuss the connection between successful biological control and evolutionary considerations.","UNIV LONDON IMPERIAL COLL SCI TECHNOL & MED, DEPT BIOL, ASCOT SL5 7PY, BERKS, ENGLAND","Murdoch, WW (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & MARINE BIOL, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA.",,"Briggs, Cheryl/F-7456-2013","Briggs, Cheryl/0000-0001-8674-5385",,,,60,159,172,2,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1996,77,7,,,,,2001,2013,,10.2307/2265696,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VM421,WOS:A1996VM42100005,,,,,2021-09-27,

This hypothesis predicts an increase in the probability of dispersal with increasing size of social groups. At a more mechanistic level and based on the known effects of competition on stress hormone levels, a positive relationship between group size and glucocorticoids of juveniles should be observed. We used a demographic approach to test these predictions on a natural population of the communally rearing and semifossorial rodent-Octodon degus. Burrow systems provide degus with places to rear offspring and to evade stressful thermal conditions and predators. Thus, we predicted dispersal to increase with increasing number of degus per main burrow system used, a measure of habitat saturation in degus. The probability of dispersal increased with increasing number of degus per main burrow system used. Mean fecal metabolites of cortisol in offspring increased, yet not statistically significantly, with the number of juveniles in groups. These results were consistent with a scenario in which competition drives natal dispersal in juveniles in social degus. In particular, competition would be the consequence of high degu abundance in relation to the abundance of burrow systems available at the time of offspring emergence.","[Quirici, Veronica; Faugeron, Sylvain; Ebensperger, Luis A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecol, Fac Ciencias Biol, Santiago 6513677, Chile; [Quirici, Veronica; Faugeron, Sylvain; Ebensperger, Luis A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Ecol & Biodiversidad, Santiago 8331150, Chile; [Quirici, Veronica; Faugeron, Sylvain; Ebensperger, Luis A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Santiago 8331150, Chile; [Hayes, Loren D.] Univ Louisiana Monroe, Dept Biol, Monroe, LA 71209 USA","Quirici, V (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecol, Fac Ciencias Biol, Santiago 6513677, Chile.",vquirici@gmail.com,"Quirici, Veronica/B-1520-2017","Quirici, Veronica/0000-0003-2302-0971; Faugeron, Sylvain/0000-0001-7258-5229",Direccion de Investigacion y Postgrado-Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (DIPUC); Mejoramiento de la Calidad y la Equidad de la Educacion Superior (MECESUP); Comision Nacional Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECTY)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1060499]; Center for the Advanced Studies in Ecology and Biodiversity (CASEB); National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0553910]; Louisiana Board of Regents Research and Development [LEQSF 2007-09-RD-A-39],"We thank J.

The lack of phosphorus leads to an inadequate abundance of phytoplankton as food sources which, along with competition among various filter feeders, might have generated the poor culture conditions. To understand how prey-predator interactions, including those of cultured oysters, are functioning, we developed a prey-predator model. Phytoplankton in different size categories were quantified, with a particular focus on phytoplankton smaller than 5 mu m, which represent suitable food sources for oyster larvae during the planktonic phase. Filter feeding animals that compete with oysters were also identified and counted. Our numerical model consisted of 25 compartments, including inorganic/organic substances, phytoplankton, zooplankton, oysters, other filter feeding animals, and fish. The model outputs reproduced the observed temporal variation of the various parameters well, including the different size categories of oyster larvae from just spawning to settlement. Sensitivity analyses showed that an increase in the dissolved inorganic phosphorus load to 10 times than present value (0.2 mg P m(-3) d(-1)) enhanced phytoplankton production, including that of small-sized phytoplankton, facilitating an increase of 51% in the successful settlement of oyster spat. In conclusion, the recent low success rates in the settlement of oyster larvae appear to be driven by insufficient quantities of the phytoplankton on which they feed. This lack of phytoplankton stems mainly from the reduction in the nutrient load in addition to competition between oysters and various other filter feeders for these food resources.","[Wahyudin; Yamamoto, Tamiji] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biosphere Sci, Higashihiroshima 7398628, Japan","Wahyudin (corresponding author), Raja ALi Haji Maritime Univ, Fac Marine Sci & Fisheries, Jl Politekn Senggarang, Tanjungpinang 29100, Riau Island Pro, Indonesia.",wahyudinps@umrah.ac.id,"Wahyudin, Wahyudin/AAB-4184-2021","wahyudin, Wahyudin/0000-0002-0882-4157",Indonesian Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP); Hiroshima University,"The first author thanks the Indonesian Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) for providing financial support for the doctoral scholarship.

This reduced post-settling mortality may be due to a reduced benthic predation in habitats with high complexity. In a field experiment, the larval settling of blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, was recorded on an artificial substrate 0.25, 1 and 2 m above the bottom during six periods in spring 1999. The experiment was conducted at four stations with dense mussel beds located at two of these stations. Two of the four stations, one with mussel beds and one without, were located in a wind-exposed area and the two other stations in a sheltered area. It was demonstrated that the larval settling was reduced up to 1 m above the mussel beds. A size analysis of the settled mussels indicated that the reduction in settling intensity close to mussel beds was due to a pre-settling process: the larvae were predated by the filtering adult mussels. Settling was significantly affected by wind stress. During periods with a high mean wind velocity and a turbulent water column, the larvae showed a reduced settlement 1 m above a mussel bed relative to 2 m above, whereas the same patterns not could be observed outside a mussel bed. The importance of the filtration activity of the adult mussels and the behaviour of the larvae is discussed. The recruitment of blue mussels into a mussel bed was investigated. Here, significant positive correlations were observed between the density of recruits and density of adult mussels and weights of empty shells. This indicates that the filtering mussels not only increase the mortality of larvae, but also serve as an important substrate reducing post-settling predation from benthic predators.","[Dolmer, Per] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark; [Stenalt, Ea] Roskilde Univ Ctr, Dept Environm Social & Spatial Change, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark","Dolmer, P (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark.",pdo@aqua.dtu.dk,,,,,,31,16,16,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0967-6120,,,AQUACULT INT,Aquac.

For crabs of similar weight, both the crusher and cutter claws of C. mamas were larger and exhibited higher mechanical advantage values of the claw lever system than C. magister. The mechanical advantages of C. maenas crusher and cutter claws are 0.37 and 0.30 respectively versus 0.25 for the claws of C. magister. To evaluate the feeding rates of similar-size crabs of each species on prey varying in shell thickness, we conducted laboratory feeding trials. Each crab was offered thin-shelled mussels (Mytilus trossulus, 30-40 mm) or thicker shelled native oysters (Ostrea lurida, 40-50 mm), and the number of consumed prey items was recorded. When offered mussels, subadult C. magister ate significantly more prey per day (7.2 prey/day) than adult C. maenas (5.4 prey/day). However, when crabs were offered harder shelled native oysters, C. mamas, with their more robust claws, were more capable of crushing them than C. magister, with their more delicate claws. Although C. maenas is competitively dominant to similar-size juvenile C. magi:vier, the per capita feeding rate and predatory impacts of these 2 species depends on prey type.","[Yamada, Sylvia Behrens] Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Davidson, Timothy Mathias] Portland State Univ ESM, Aquat Bioinvas Res & Policy Inst, Portland, OR 97207 USA","Yamada, SB (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",yamadas@science.oregonsate.edu,,"Davidson, Timothy/0000-0001-9535-7982","National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA06OAR4170010, E/INT-86]","The authors are grateful to Timothy Sullivan for drawing Figure 1, Jennifer Yamada for creating Figure 2, and Amanda Amstutz for helping with the mussel feeding experiment.

The species number and biomass increased after liming and had its peak during the neutralised fishless period. There was a change in numeric relations between the functional groups - graspers, suspension feeders and predators - which was correlated to the experimental measures, i.e. liming and fish introduction. The development of the rotifer community is discussed in relation to effects of predation, competition and trophic cascades. During the limed fishless period, high densities of phantom midge larvae (Chaoborus spp.) and waterboatmen (Corixidae) suppressed susceptible prey organisms, mainly crustaceans. These predators were largely eliminated after fish introduction resulting in a predatory release of crustacean zooplankton. The increase of crustaceans after the introduction of fish implied a competitive suppression of rotifers.

The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis predicts that domestication in an artificial environment lacking predators and providing abundant resources prefers proactive individuals with strong feeding motivation, high levels of aggression and risk taking, with low hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responsiveness. In the present experiment we weaned fingerling pike-perch from live feed and habituated them to formulated feed. We recorded the number of weeks needed for the fish to accept pellets, their body length at the age of 100 days, their boldness in a novel object test and their HPI axis responsiveness. Individuals accepting the artificial feed within the first week grew larger than fish habituating later; therefore early weaners would be kept and bred in routine aquaculture procedures. Contrary to predictions of POLS hypothesis, fish weaning earlier and thus growing faster were less bold and had higher HPI axis responsiveness than fish accepting the pellets later or never. As live feed is preferred to artificial pellets, less competitive individuals may switch to pellets earlier. Inadvertent selection for stress sensitive fish may have an effect on production in aquaculture as well as on natural population after intensive restocking.","[Molnar, Tamas; Csuvar, Adrienn; Benedek, Ildiko; Molnar, Marcell; Kabai, Peter] Kaposvar Univ, Inst Environm Sci & Nat Protect, Kaposvar, Hungary","Molnar, T (corresponding author), Kaposvar Univ, Inst Environm Sci & Nat Protect, Kaposvar, Hungary.",molnart75@gmail.com,"Molnar, Tamas/H-7945-2019; Kabai, Peter/C-9909-2010","Molnar, Tamas/0000-0003-1752-4268","National Research, Development and Innovation Office (Hungary) [OTKA K112070]; European UnionEuropean Commission [EFOP-3.6.1-16-2016-00007]","The work was supported by the National Research, Development and Innovation Office (Hungary) (OTKA K112070), and by the EFOP-3.6.1-16-2016-00007 project of the European Union.

Daphnia laevis was the dominant herbivore, while Diaphanosoma birgei, Notodiaptomus carteri, and Thermocyclops minutus were also permanently present. 73% of all correlations found for different species and population parameters were delayed. When Daphnia was abundant in December-January, its population was controlled by predation of a water mite Piona sp., nannoplankton concentration, and its own interference. Other crustaceans were suppressed at that time by Daphnia interference and by netplankton. A bloom of filamentous cyanobacteria appeared in March after Daphnia declined in numbers due to predation by the water mite and a fish Moenkhausia intermedia. The bloom probably caused further Daphnia decline and promoted a rise in numbers of small Cladocera. During Daphnia depression, other crustaceans, more immune to fish and cyanobacteria, were controlled by stimulating effects of nannoplankton and inhibition by netplankton. Fish impact upon cladocerans, the most preferred food, was not elevated during periods of full moon. No signs of the influence on crustaceans by a predatory Chaoborus were found.

These predictions were applied to data from a 12-year field study on Hanuman langurs (Presbytis entellus) that ranged freely around Jodhpur (India). It appears that hierarchical relationships between females (unstable, inconsistent, individualistic, with low rates of agonistic coalitions) reflect scramble within-group competition. Such competition, however, results in individual evolutionary advantages (differential feeding time; differential reproductive success) so that dominance effects mirror contest within-group competition.

Many amphibians breed in temporary ponds, which vary in hydroperiod and levels of competition, predation, and resource abundance. Newly filled ponds have fewer competitors and predators and more periphyton and phytoplankton, which are more palatable food sources for anuran larvae. We tested for oviposition site preference between old and new water pools in Hyla chrysoscelis, a species known to have better larval performance in newly filled pools. Consistent with larval performance and the observation that anurans often breed in ponds immediately after they fill, H. chrysoscelis selectively oviposited in new pools. Conductivity was significantly lower and dissolved oxygen significantly higher in new versus old pools, and these may be cues of pond age and productivity, respectively. We demonstrate that adult oviposition site selection preferences in our study match larval performance differences seen in previous work and that this preference is not simply for newly filled ponds but for ponds with a recent influx of water. These results further suggest novel ways for land managers to increase amphibian populations. Draining ponds will increase their attractiveness to breeding females who simultaneously avoid fish and choose new water.","[Pintar, Matthew R.; Resetarits, William J., Jr.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA","Pintar, MR (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA.",mpintar@go.olemiss.edu,"Pintar, Matthew/AAP-1876-2020","Pintar, Matthew/0000-0003-0165-3882",University of Mississippi; Henry L. and Grace Doherty Foundation,"C.

Many organisms select habitat patches based on intrinsic patch quality, but patches exist in complex landscapes linked by dispersal and colonization, forming metapopulations and metacommunities. Perceived patch quality can be influenced by neighbouring patches through spatial contagion, wherein perceived quality of one patch can extend beyond its borders and either increase or decrease the colonization of neighbouring patches and localities. These spatially explicit colonization dynamics can result in habitat compression, wherein more colonists occupy a patch or locality than in the absence of spatial context dependence. Previous work on contagion/compression focused primarily on the role of predators in driving colonization patterns. Our goal was to determine whether resource abundance can drive multi-scale colonization dynamics of aquatic beetles through the processes of contagion and compression in naturally colonized experimental pools. We established two levels (high/low quality) of within-patch resource abundances (leaf litter) using an experimental landscape of mesocosms, and assayed colonization by 35 species of aquatic beetles. Patches were arranged in localities (sets of two patches), which consisted of a combination of two patch-level resource levels in a 2 x 2 factorial design, allowing us to assay colonization at both locality and patch levels. We demonstrate that patterns of species abundance and richness of colonizing aquatic beetles are determined by patch quality and context-dependent processes at multiple spatial scales. Localities that consisted of at least one high-quality patch were colonized at equivalent rates that were higher than localities containing only low-quality patches, displaying regional reward contagion. In localities that consisted of one high- and one low-quality patch, reward contagion produced by higher leaf litter levels resulted in greater abundance of beetles in such localities, which then compressed into the highest quality patches. Our results provide further support for the critical roles of habitat selection and spatial context, particularly the quality of neighbouring habitat patches, in generating patterns of species abundances and community structure across landscapes.","[Pintar, Matthew R.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA; Univ Mississippi, University, MS 38677 USA","Pintar, MR (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, University, MS 38677 USA.",matthew.pintar@gmail.com,"Pintar, Matthew/AAP-1876-2020","Pintar, Matthew/0000-0003-0165-3882",University of Mississippi; Henry L. and Grace Doherty Foundation,University of Mississippi; Henry L. and Grace Doherty Foundation,,74,8,8,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

However, in situations where parental care does not involve direct provisioning of the offspring, but rather activities directed at the brood as a whole (e.g. guarding), it may be more efficient for parents to care for large numbers of young at once. This may be especially true for species with exclusive paternal care, with fathers that have recently acquired a brood of young potentially benefitting from vigorously courting prospective mates, so as to maximise their chances of attaining a large number of young to rear together. We experimentally tested this hypothesis in the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a fish with male only care. Contrary to our predictions, we found no evidence of any differences in courtship between recently spawned egg-tending fathers and males that had not spawned. However, males that were permitted to spawn, but then had their eggs taken from them, courted less vigorously. Together, the results of our study suggest that the potential benefits of vigorous courtship in terms of acquiring additional young may be offset by additional costs faced by parental males.","[Deal, Nicholas D.

To explore genetic relatedness independent of these behaviors, we investigated the effects of kinship on the growth of the kelp perch Brachyistius frenatus, a live-bearing, planktivorous marine reef fish that is capable of only limited dispersal. Although juveniles occur in aggregations and compete for food resources, they do not exhibit overt aggressive or cooperative behavioral interactions. We hypothesized that under competition and in the absence of these behaviors, sibling and non-sibling groups of juvenile Br. frenatus raised at the same densities in the field would not differ in average growth, but that siblings would exhibit lower variation in growth, simply due to genetic similarities in inherent growth rates. Pregnant, female kelp perch were collected and placed in cages until parturition was complete. Groups of young; recently born from the same mother or from different mothers, were then raised in the field for 9 wk. Our results revealed that average growth rates were similar between sibling and non-sibling treatments. While variation in growth increased initially in non-siblings, siblings showed little such variation. This divergence, however, was not consistent over the duration of the experiment, and variation in the growth of siblings ultimately converged with that of non-siblings. Effects of genetic relatedness would be most likely to manifest themselves early after birth, before environmental factors exert their influence, and this may explain the initial separation but eventual convergence in variation in growth between sibling and non-sibling treatments. For B. frenatus and other organisms that will encounter relatives and compete for resources without overt behavioral interactions, the degree of kinship may play a minor role in the demography of local populations.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Anderson, TW (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",andersto@bcc.orst.edu,,,,,,67,3,4,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

A number of factors like quantity and quality of acorn production, heavy predation and browsing on acorns and seedlings and low growth rate of oak seedlings contribute in regeneration failures. To study the influence of light, nutrients and water on growth in Quercus robur I,. seedlings in relation to site preparation, a field experiment was established. The experiment was carried out in a clear-cut and a shelterwood in southern Sweden from 1992 until 1995. Five different treatments were applied and acorns were then planted. The treatments were: herbicide, herbicide and mixing of the humus layer and the top 10 cm of the mineral soil, herbicide and removal of the humus layer, herbicide and deep cultivation down to 40 cm with the humus layer in the bottom and undisturbed control. Irrespective of the method, the different site preparation treatments after three years equally well prevented the growth of ground vegetation and increased the seedling growth. PPFD (photosynthetic photon flux density) at seedling level was about 20% of full light in the shelterwood and in the undisturbed control plots in the clear-cut. PPFD at the seedling level were about 60% of full light in the different site preparation treatments in the clear-cut. The mean cumulative soil water potential was about the same in undisturbed control plots in the clear-cut and shelterwood. In the different site preparation treatments, mean cumulative soil water potential indicated lower values in the clear-cut compared to the shelterwood. According to measurements of the leaf water potential, seedlings seemed to be more affected by water stress in the clear-cut. Nitrogen concentration in leaves was about the same in all treatments. Longer periods with shelterwoods in combination with the additional site preparation for ground vegetation control was recommended for practical forestry for improved growth of oak seedlings during natural regeneration. It does not seem to be important which method of additional ground vegetation control is chosen as long as the amount of ground vegetation is reduced. It was concluded that light level alone is not the key factor controlling growth of oak seedlings during natural regeneration. However, light and soil water content may interact and influence the growth of oak seedlings.

This sponge harboured large populations of heterotrophic bacteria but no photosynthetic symbionts (cyanobacteria). However, 1 and 2 were not associated with the bacteria but with the sponge cells as shown by their distribution in enriched cell fractions obtained by differential centrifugation and Ficoll density gradients. Spherulous cells, found in great abundance in the sponge ectosome, were assumed to be involved in the production of 1 and 2. The target compounds were detected, although in small amounts, in short-term cultures of sponge cells, validating the possibility of a continuous cell culture source. Laboratory assays showed that organic sponge extracts affected the behaviour of the coral Madracis mirabilis in causing closure and retraction of the polyps at concentrations of the combined compounds 1 and 2 (1:3.3) as low as 0.7 mg/l (0.0125% of the concentration in whole sponges). At higher concentrations (1.4 mg/l) no recovery of the polyps occurred. The extracts, at almost natural concentrations of 1 and 2, deterred feeding by the predatory reef fish Stegastis partitus, supporting other reported research. In field experiments, wounding induced a sharp increase of 1 and 2 in the sponge tissues but prolonged predator exclusion by caging and forced confrontation with coral neighbours did not yield measurable changes in 1 and 2 concentrations. All sponges were found to release measurable amounts of bromopyrrole alkaloids in seawater conditioned for 30 min. Crude and fractionated sponge extracts and pure sceptrin (2) were active against bacteria, yeast and filamentous fungi. Taken together, these results support a role of oroidin (1) and sceptrin (2) in defence mechanisms against predators and possibly against space competitors and invading and fouling organisms.

The size and demography of swamp antechinus (Antechinus minimus) populations located in a coastal mainland habitat and on a small offshore island in south-eastern Australia were investigated. Large demographic differences occurred between the two ecosystems, with the island population density often 100 times greater than that on the mainland. The swamp antechinus in the mainland habitat was influenced by extrinsic climatic forces, with juvenile recruitment, individual body mass and overall population size being affected by rainfall, a factor likely to influence food availability for the species. However, the island population did not appear to be affected by drought to the same degree where allochthonous marine nutrient inputs may have offset any drought-induced reduction in primary production. Significantly greater juvenile recruitment in the island habitats combined with restricted emigration and potentially reduced predation and interspecific competition are likely to be responsible for the high population densities on the island. Although island populations appear robust, future conservation efforts should focus on mainland populations given the genetic deficiencies in the island populations.","[Sale, Michael G.; Arnould, John P.

The effective management of invasive plants requires an understanding of their invasiveness in contrasting environments. The effects of disturbance on recruitment of broom Cytisus scoparius, a European shrub invading parts of Australasia, was assessed in a 7-year experiment carried out in two countries, respectively, in its native and exotic ranges. This paper presents the results for Australia and their implications for the biological control of this weed. 2. Disturbance treatments involved removal (cut or cut plus cultivation) and grazing effects on broom seed banks and recruitment, in mature and immature stands and in three habitats, ranging from improved, largely exotic pasture to unimproved native grassland. 3. The time between recruitment and flowering varied between 5 and 7 years depending on habitat, the slowest being in native unimproved grassland. In cultivated plots, regeneration was faster in immature compared with mature broom stands. 4. Following broom removal, whether the ground was cultivated or not had little effect on the speed of regeneration, indicating weak suppression from the ground flora in uncultivated plots. In contrast, grazing tended to increase the rate of regeneration. 5. The timing of seedling establishment had little effect on survival to reproduction, in marked contrast to European populations. The overall rates of seedling mortality were greater in Australia compared with Europe. 6. A simulation model, parameterized from the field data, was used to explore the likely impact of biological control from pre-dispersal seed predation. 7. The simulation studies demonstrated large habitat-specific differences in seed rain requirement for broom persistence and the potential impact of seed predators. Seed rain requirements were fivefold less in improved exotic pasture vs. native grassland. Seed loss of 62% was theoretically sufficient to suppress broom in native grassland, whereas > 97% was required in exotic pasture. 8. This study suggests that successful broom control in Australia is likely to be site dependent, because while broom seed has greater opportunities for recruitment in Australia than in Europe, immature plant mortality can be very high, particularly in native grassland.","CSIRO, Entomol CRC Weed Management Syst, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; CSIRO, NSW Agr, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; CSIRO, Trop Ecosyst Res Ctr, Winnellie, NT 0822, Australia; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Sheppard, AW (corresponding author), CSIRO, Entomol CRC Weed Management Syst, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",Andy.Sheppard@csiro.au,"Sheppard, Andy W/C-1045-2009","Sheppard, Andy W/0000-0002-6188-7122",,,,46,82,84,1,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Previous research in the region shows that suppression of dingoes initiates trophic cascades between dingoes-red foxes-small mammals and woody shrubs and between dingoes-kangaroos and grasses. Results show that terrestrial insectivores were more abundant and the rate of insectivory indexed as the rate of consumption of experimentally provisioned meal-worms was greater where dingoes were common. Overall abundance, diversity and taxon richness of arthropods was unaffected by dingo status. However, there were distinct differences in the composition of arthropod assemblages across the DBF. Scolopendridae, Acrididae and Lepismatidae were more abundant where dingoes were rare, while Tenebrionidae and Blattidae were more abundant where dingoes were common. Our results lend support to the idea that suppression of dingo populations can trigger >= 4 link trophic cascades that extend to arthropod assemblages. We hypothesize that dingo suppression engenders shifts in arthropod assemblages due to a decrease in the intensity of insectivory, changes in habitat structure and alteration of the predatory and competitive interactions between arthropod taxa.","[Contos, Peter; Letnic, Mike] Univ New South Wales, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Letnic, M (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",m.letnic@unsw.edu.au,,"Letnic, Michael/0000-0003-4191-8427; Contos, Peter/0000-0002-0006-5790",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"This research was funded by the Australian Research Council.

Since 1998, the total population has declined 4%/y to similar to 1,100 animals. Despite this trend, the population in the MHI is increasing, with monk seals pupping at Kalaupapa National Historical Park on the island of Moloka'i. Long-time human residents in Kalaupapa indicated that monk seals rarely used the beaches prior to 1997, and no births had been observed since at least 1941. Since 1997, a total of 53 pups have been born, with births increasing at an average annual rate of 26.6%. Reproductively active females born at Kalaupapa exhibited a 55.6% site fidelity. Spatially, monk seal density was higher on sandy beaches (2.0 monk seals km(-1)) than basalt (0.3 monk seals km(-1)) habitat. Temporally, monk seal density was highest during the late spring and early summer due to the presence of mother-pup pairs. After weaning, monk seals also used adjacent basalt habitat and typically moved away from Kalaupapa at the onset of winter; since 2009, monk seal sightings have increased throughout the year. Explanations for the emergence of the pupping area include suitable habitat characteristics (e. g., protected shallow water habitat, high prey abundance, and low predator/competitor abundance), reduction of human activities (e. g., elimination of cattle in 1985, sparse [3.4 people km(-2)] and declining [90% since 1900] human population, and low public visitation [8,494 people y(-1)]), and a supportive community. Current management actions include habitat-use surveys, population studies, community presentations, and law enforcement patrols. Kalaupapa has become a productive pupping area for monk seals in the MHI, and the establishment of a birthing area provides hope for the survival of this endangered species.","[Brown, Eric; Hughes, Guy; Watanuki, Randall] Kalaupapa Natl Hist Pk, Kalaupapa, HI 96742 USA; [Johanos, Thea C.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wurth, Tracy] Univ Hawaii, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Brown, E (corresponding author), Kalaupapa Natl Hist Pk, POB 2222, Kalaupapa, HI 96742 USA.",Eric_Brown@nps.gov,,,NPS [091261]; NMFS,"All tagging work was conducted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act/Endangered Species Protection Permit # 848-1365.

Accordingly, we tested in the field the following hypotheses: (i) sprat and herring are selective feeders and (ii) sprat and herring selectivity is size- and season-dependent. The results show that (i) smaller herring and all size classes of sprat are strictly zooplanktivorous. selecting principally Temora longicornis and Bosmina maritima during the autumn and Pseudocalanus elongatus in winter; (ii) larger herring are essentially nektobenthos feeders, predating on Mysis mixta during the autumn and amphipods and polychaetes during the winter; and (iii) herring and sprat seem to avoid Acartia spp. in both autumn and winter. During the autumn, herring are zooplanktivorous up to 18-20 cm, whereas in winter herring feed on nektobenthos starting from 14-15 cm. Selectivity was not an absolute process but it was related to prey relative abundance in the sea and, possibly, to prey profitability (e.g. size, conspicuousness. and reaction time).

Levins investigated the relative benefits of synchronous versus asynchronous application of control measures for agricultural insect pests. He concluded that synchronous control measures were optimal because synchrony removes temporary refuges for the pests. However, his conclusions rest on the assumption that there are no predators whose population dynamics are coupled to those of the pest. Using a novel metapopulation model, we investigate the consequences of synchronous versus asynchronous crop planting for the density of a pest either with or without specific predators. We show that whereas synchronous planting generally leads to the lowest pest densities in the absence of predators, in the presence of predators asynchronous planting may produce the lowest pest densities. The relative advantages of synchronous versus asynchronous planting depend on the population dynamics and migration rates of pests and predators within fields. Our metapopulation model is designed for application to real data, making it possible to select the optimal pest control strategy for particular crop systems. For many crops, such as rice grown In the Tropics, current guidelines promote synchronous planting. Our results show that asynchronous planting may potentially be better.","INDONESIAN NATL INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT PROGRA,JAKARTA 12540,INDONESIA","Ives, AR (corresponding author), UNIV WISCONSIN,DEPT ZOOL,MADISON,WI 53706, USA.",,"Ives, Anthony/A-5698-2008","Ives, Anthony/0000-0001-9375-9523",,,,36,70,73,2,36,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 S WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

However, trees can also compete with crops for light, water, and nutrients. Field experiment at the Shihezi Oasis in northern Xinjiang Province assessed the effects of distance on photosynthetic characteristics and yield of wheat in a jujube tree (Zizyphus jujuba Mill.)/wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) agroforestry system. The experiment used two treatments: a control of sole-cropped wheat (D0) and a jujube tree/wheat agroforestry system. The agroforestry system included the different distances of 90, 110, and 130cm (D1, D2, and D3, respectively) between the wheat and the jujube trees. Photosynthetic characteristics, leaf area index (LAI), the number of stems, and yield components of wheat were determined. The net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and the stomatal conductance (Gs) of the D0, D2, and D3 during the filling stage were significantly higher than the D1. No significant difference in transpiration rate (Tr) and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) was noted between sole-cropped wheat and agroforestry system. From the tillering to ripening stages, significant differences were observed in stem, tiller number, and dry matter accumulation per plant, and in LAI, which ranked D0>D3>D2>D1. D0 and D3 plants had significantly higher numbers of spikes, grains per spike, and weight of thousand grains than D1 and D2 plants. The crop yield was ranked as D0>D3>D2>D1, with significant differences among D0, D1, D2, and D3. In conclusion, wheat yield increased as the distance from jujube trees increased in this jujube tree/wheat intercropping system.","[Yang, T.; Duan, Z. P.; Gan, Y. W.; Wang, B. J.; Hao, X.

Snakes have become widely used in studies of the ecological basis of sexual dimorphism because they are gape-limited predators and their head morphology is likely to be a direct indicator of the size and shape of prey consumed. We examined sexual dimorphism of body size and head morphology, as well as sexual differences in diet, in a population of Mexican lance-headed rattlesnakes, Crotalus polystictus, from the State of Mexico, Mexico. The maximum snoutvent length of males was greater than that of females by 21%. Males had relatively larger heads, and differed from females in head shape after removing the effects of head size. In addition, male rattlesnakes showed positive allometry in head shape: head width was amplified, whereas snout length was truncated with increased head size. By contrast, our data did not provide clear evidence of allometry in head shape of females. Adults of both males and females ate predominately mice and voles; however, males also consumed a greater proportion of larger mammalian species, and fewer small prey species. The differences in diet correspond with dimorphism in head morphology, and provide evidence of intersexual niche divergence in the study population. However, because the sexes overlapped greatly in diet, we hypothesize that diet and head dimorphisms in C. polystictus are likely related to different selection pressures in each sex arising from pre-existing body size differences rather than from character displacement for reducing intersexual competition.

Theoretical models predict that territoriality will be selected when resources of intermediate abundance are distributed variably and predictably in time and space, but can be selected against if the resource-holding potential of individuals is low or the risk of predation is high. Here we used a model averaging approach in a mixed modelling framework to analyse 5 years of observational and experimental data collected on group responses to actual and perceived intruders in the cooperatively breeding chestnut-crowned babbler, Pomatostomus ruficeps, in order to provide a rare test of the relative importance of resource value, resource-holding potential and predation risk in territorial behaviour. We found that babblers were highly plastic in their responses to actual and simulated intruders: on average, approaches occurred on 55% of occasions, and aggression ensued in 55% of approaches (observational and experimental results combined). Whether or not babbler groups approached, and if so were aggressive towards, actual or simulated intrusions was explained by time of day, location, group sizes, predator encounter rate and habitat characteristics, but not by reproductive status. Consideration of each of these effects regarding the three hypotheses above suggested comparable roles of group competitive advantage and predation risk on approach probability, whereas ensuing aggression was mostly explained by correlates of resource value. Our study provides compelling evidence to suggest that the risk of predation can affect the incidence of territorial and agonistic behaviour between social groups of animals by moderating the effects of resource value and group competitiveness, and might partly explain the high plasticity in group responses to intrusions.

One of many costs suggested to counteract the evolution of increased intrinsic growth rate is an associated reduction in tolerance to conditions of nutrient stress. Here we test this concept with individuals possessing experimentally increased intrinsic growth rates (growth hormone transgenic coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch) relative to wild genotypes. Using a series of three experiments, survival and growth of both genotypes were assessed on a physiological and behavioral level while varying food abundance, social interactions, and predation risk. Only in complete absence of exogenous food in newly emerged fry did the high intrinsic growth rate appear costly with a shorter average survival time compared to wild-type (Exp. 1). In experiment 2, genotypes with elevated intrinsic growth showed equal or higher survival and growth than wild-type genotypes In a third experiment, adding very limited amounts of food and allowing for social interactions in a simulated natural environment benefited transgenic individuals relative to wild-types, but at similar magnitudes in both the absence and presence of predators. Populations with transgenic individuals present did not crash under these competitive conditions as previously reported when studied in simple environments where hiding and attack escape were not possible. Our data suggest that transgenic fish have a greater scope for growth under most conditions, but are not obligated to use this capability. Physiological (e.g. appetite and conversion efficiency) and behavioral traits (e.g. competitive ability and risk-taking) found previously to correlate positively with intrinsic growth rate in the transgenic strain likely aided in their survival and growth, even under food limited conditions. Hence, at least in coho salmon, intrinsic growth rate does not appear to strongly affect survival under nutrient stress.","[Sundstrom, L.

Fewer egg rafts of the mosquito Culiseta longiareolata were found in the free Anax treatment compared to the other two treatments. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of egg rafts between control and caged Anax pools. Thus, while Culiseta females apparently oviposit fewer egg rafts in the presence of unconstrained Anax, they did not respond to predation risk from the caged Anax. Larval Culiseta densities were drastically reduced by free Anax; there was nearly a 100% reduction in the number reaching metamorphosis (pupae) and a 100% reduction in emergence (pupal exuviae). There were no significant treatment effects on densities of crustaceans, Daphnia magna and Heterocypris sp., or on chironomid pupal exuviae. Ceratopogonid pupal abundance was higher in free Anax pools than in the other two treatments toward the end of the experiment. Free Anax caused a trophic cascade, presumably by strongly reducing the dominant periphyton grazer, Culiseta larvae; periphyton mass was greater in the free Anax treatment than in the control. However, there was no behavioral trophic cascade, i.e., no difference in periphyton abundance between the control and caged Anax treatment.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Biol, Ctr Biol Control, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Univ Haifa, Inst Evolut, Lab Community Ecol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel","Stav, G (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel.",,,,,,,73,62,62,0,29,SOC VECTOR ECOLOGY,SANTA ANA,"PO BOX 87, SANTA ANA, CA 92702 USA",1081-1710,,,J VECTOR ECOL,J.

Experimental clumps containing an average of 15 mussels were attached to the rocky shore for 11-57 days during three summers. The arrival of predators, deaths due to predators and to other causes were recorded on successive visits to each clump. Failure time analysis was used to analyze the effects of site, intertidal height and years on: (I) the time of the first arrival of the predatory snail Nucella lapillus, (2) the time to the commencement of drilling, and (3) the time to the first mussel death due to Nucella. Attacks by crabs were rare, and no attacks by seastars were recorded. Analyses showed striking differences among sites, years, and height. At the site most affected by predators, Nucella arrived at clumps in less than 4 days, commenced drilling within 4 days, and killed the first mussel within eight days in all three years. At the least affected site, arrival and attacks by predators were so rare that the estimated median time of the first death was greater than 7 weeks. Rates of arrival, attacks, and mortality tended to be greater on the mid shore than the low shore. Analyses suggest mortality rates are very variable among seemingly similar sites and among years. Data on abundance of Nucella showed site-to-site variation, but no correlation with mussel mortality. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

In analogy to individual choice, such effects may produce undermatching-group distribution falling short of resource distribution-or overmatching-group distribution overshooting resource distribution. In the present experiments, a flock of about 30 pigeons distributed between two patches with continuous inputs of green peas. Competition was varied by changing the size or extent of the patches. When the patches were areas or troughs, some undermatching occurred. When the patches were small bowls, strong undermatching occurred. When travel was required to switch patches, undermatching decreased slightly. A visual barrier that prevented pigeons from seeing one patch from the other had no effect. Overall rate of food delivery, varied over a wide range, had no effect. It appeared that the mechanism of flock distribution depended on comparisons between patches that were successive rather than simultaneous. Although most pigeons participated in the experiments, and different pigeons participated to different extents, individual pigeons tended to be consistent in the extent of participation from session to session, suggesting the possibility that participation might reflect competitive ability. Examination of the preferences and switching of individual pigeons revealed no consistency within or across individuals. It appeared that the flock's distribution was a truly emergent phenomenon, in the sense that results at the level of the flock in no way paralleled behavior at the level of the individual.","Univ New Hampshire, Dept Psychol, Durham, NH 03824 USA","Baum, WM (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Psychol, Conant Hall,10 Lib Way, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",wm.baum@unh.edu,"Baum, William/AAF-4740-2020",,,,,33,28,29,3,40,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-5002,1938-3711,,J EXP ANAL BEHAV,J.

Three densities of Nuphar lutea leaves were manipulated in enclosures to 10%, 50% and 90% coverage of the water surface. Perch (total length ca. 15 cm) was stocked in half of the enclosures in a density 3 fish m(-2). The vertical distribution of Chironomus f.l. plumosus larvae (classified in the size classes: 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20 and >20 mm) in the bottom sediment showed a clear pattern, with bigger larvae burrowing to the greatest depth. Densities of all larval size classes except 0-5 mm were negatively affected both by plant density and by perch in three sediment layers considered (0-2, 2-5 and 5-10 cm). The larvae formerly at the surface did not move deeper in the sediments to avoid fish predation. The size distribution of the larvae, with the prevalence of the 15-20 and 10-15 mm larvae, found in the guts of perch was the most similar to that in the upper sediments at low and medium plant densities, and to that in the intermediate, 2-5 cm, sediment layer at high plant density. The effect of the interaction between plant density and fish was significant for all the larvae except those of 10-15 and 15-20 mm. Although the results of the experiment showed size-selective feeding by perch, the direct overall effect of the fish on the size-structure of the larvae was limited by vertical distribution of the prey in the bottom sediment. In addition, it was modified by nymphaeids, which, at high density, altered food conditions and acted as a refuge for Chironomus larvae both directly (providing shelter) and indirectly (providing fish with the additional, epiphytic prey).",,"Kornijow, R (corresponding author), UNIV AGR,DEPT HYDROBIOL & ICHTHYOBIOL,POB 158,AKAD 13,PL-20950 LUBLIN 1,POLAND.",,,,,,,29,27,28,0,11,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JAN 17,1997,342,,,,,,207,213,,10.1023/A:1017067621668,,,7,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,WZ139,WOS:A1997WZ13900023,,,,,2021-09-27,

When perceiving themselves at an elevated level of risk, animals frequently reduce conspicuous behaviors in trade-off for a decrease in probability of being preyed upon. In the present study, we used two experiments to examine the effect of perceived predation risk from cod (Gadus morhua) on nonreproductive and reproductive behaviors in the sex-role reversed pipefish (Syngnathus typhle). In the first experiment, no differences due to predation risk were detected in the nonreproductive behaviors of either males or females. In the second experiment, predation risk had significant effects on reproductive behaviors. Pipefish were allowed to court and copulate at four different predation levels. We created predation levels differing in perceived predation risk by controlling the number of sensory modes through which pipefish could detect the presence of a cod. As predation risk increased, pipefish copulated and courted less frequently, swam alone (displayed and searched for conspecifics) less often, and waited longer before commencing courtship. These changes in behavior minimized the amount of time spent above the eelgrass and presumably reduced conspicuousness to visual predators. Pipefish also copulated after a smaller amount of courtship as predation risk increased, indicating that they may trade information concerning mate quality for a reduction ill predation risk. No differences were found in any response variable between males and females. The role of operational sex ratios and intersexual competition in determining which sex assumes greater costs in mate acquisition is questioned.","DEPT ZOOL, S-75236 UPPSALA, SWEDEN",,,,"Fuller, Rebecca/0000-0002-5744-8012",,,,50,74,74,2,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Though predation is also important in structuring marine soft-sediment benthic communities, the influence of nutrient enrichment in marine benthic systems is less well understood. We examined the interactive effects of nutrient enrichment and predator exclusion on a benthic community to assess the importance of these factors and to zest the bottom-up:lop-down theory of trophic control in this habitat. Predator exclusion was associated with increased numbers of surface deposit feeders but had less impact on burrowing deposit feeders. Effects of nutrient addition on abundances were observed only in treatments allowing predator access, but increased size of a benthic polychaete, Streblospio benedicti Webster, was observed in predator exclusion treatments with nutrient addition relative to other exclusion plots. However, responses to nutrient addition and predator exclusion varied between years.

We describe the agroecological and social characteristics of 61 food-producing gardens in New York City, drawing on gardener interviews, land-use maps, plant species inventories, arthropod scouting, and soil sampling and analysis. Gardens contained agricultural crops, food production infrastructure, ornamental plants, and recreational areas in varying proportions, indicating that gardens serve multiple and distinct purposes depending on community needs and interests. On average, gardeners devoted the greatest proportion of garden area (44 %) to food production, and supplied a large share of their households' produce needs from their community gardens. Solanaceae, Brassicaceae, and Cucurbitaceae crops dominated food crop areas, hindering effective crop rotation to prevent disease and pest problems. Most gardeners grew crops in raised beds constructed with clean fill and compost. These soils generally had sandy textures, low water-holding capacity, high organic matter levels (with a large proportion from recent inputs) and excessive nutrient levels. Soil water content at field capacity increased exponentially with total soil carbon, suggesting that organic matter enhances water-holding capacity. Insect pest densities greatly exceeded action thresholds in nearly all gardens for aphids and whiteflies on Brassica crops, aphids on Cucurbit crops, and two-spotted spider mites on tomatoes. Predator and parasitoid densities were generally low (less than one per plant on average), perhaps partially due to low floral and woody perennial cover in most gardens (12 % and 9 % on average, respectively). Dominant groups of natural enemies were minute pirate bugs, spiders, and parasitoid wasps. A wide variety of people of differing experience levels, incomes, and ethnicities participate in community gardening in NYC, and most gardens host multiple languages. Promising directions for urban gardening research, education, and practice include: 1) Cover cropping to improve soil quality and nutrient management, and diversify crop rotations; 2) Improving access to soil testing and guidance on appropriate use of soil amendments, 3) Enhancing habitat for arthropod natural enemies that provide biological control of insect pests with floral and woody perennial plantings; and 4) Incorporating ecological knowledge and inquiry-based approaches into gardening workshops, educational materials, and technical support, and offering these resources in multiple languages.","[Gregory, Megan M.; Drinkwater, Laurie E.] Cornell Univ, Dept Hort, 134A Plant Sci Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Leslie, Timothy W.] Long Isl Univ, Dept Biol, 801M,1 Univ Plaza, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Gregory, Megan M.] Forsyth Cty Cooperat Extens, 1450 Fairchild Rd, Winston Salem, NC 27105 USA","Gregory, MM (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Hort, 134A Plant Sci Bldg, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.; Gregory, MM (corresponding author), Forsyth Cty Cooperat Extens, 1450 Fairchild Rd, Winston Salem, NC 27105 USA.",gregormm@forsyth.cc,,"Gregory, Megan/0000-0003-0398-1847; Drinkwater, Laurie/0000-0002-0746-6765",Toward Sustainability Foundation; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2010-11-293]; Food Dignity Project (USDA/National Institute of Food andAgriculture / Agricultural and Food Research Initiative) [2011-68004-30074]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); Land Grant Fellowship from Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences [2012-2014],"Our thanks and appreciation go to all of the community gardeners in NYC who welcomed us into their gardens, shared their knowledge and experiences, and facilitated ecological data collection.

This is particularly interesting for generalist predators that can reproduce on these food sources. However, a potential risk for pest control could occur when herbivores also benefit from supplemental food sources. In order to optimize biological control, it may be important to select food sources that support predator populations more than herbivore populations. In this study we evaluated the nutritional quality of four types of supplemental food for the generalist predatory mites Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot and Amblydromalus (Typhlodromalus) limonicus (Garman and McGregor), both important thrips predators, and for the herbivore western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande, by assessing oviposition rates. These tests showed that application of corn pollen, cattail pollen or sterilized eggs of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller to chrysanthemum leaves resulted in three times higher oviposition rates of thrips compared to leaves without additional food. None of the tested food sources promoted predatory mites or western flower thrips exclusively. Decapsulated cysts of Artemia franciscana Kellogg were not suitable, whereas cattail pollen was very suitable for both predatory mites and western flower thrips. In addition, we found that the rate of thrips predation by A. swirskii can be reduced by 50 %, when pollen is present. Nevertheless, application of pollen or Ephestia eggs to a chrysanthemum crop still strongly enhanced the biological control of thrips with A. swirskii, both at low and high release densities of predatory mites through the strong numerical response of the predators. Despite these positive results, application in a crop should be approached with caution, as the results may strongly depend on the initial predator-prey ratio, the nutritional quality of the supplemental food source, the species of predatory mites, the distribution of the food in the crop and the type of crop.","[Leman, Ada; Messelink, Gerben J.] Wageningen UR Greenhouse Hort, NL-2265 ZG Bleiswijk, Netherlands","Messelink, GJ (corresponding author), Wageningen UR Greenhouse Hort, POB 20, NL-2265 ZG Bleiswijk, Netherlands.",gerben.messelink@wur.nl,"Messelink, Gerben J./AAD-1738-2019","Messelink, Gerben J./0000-0002-5196-1229","Dutch Ministry of Economic AffairsMinistry of Economic Affairs, Netherlands",This study was funded by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs.

In treatments with high habitat complexity, more juveniles survived, more were newly moulted and they had a higher specific growth rate (SGR) at the end of the experiment than juveniles in treatments with low habitat complexity. The presence of adult males did not affect survival, moulting stage or growth of the juveniles. The presence of adult males decreased juvenile activity during night. Juveniles in treatments with low habitat complexity were more active than juveniles in high habitat complexity during both day and night. There was no difference in total invertebrate biomass between treatments. However, some invertebrate taxa, such as Chironomidae larvae, were affected by habitat complexity or the presence of adult crayfish. Juvenile crayfish in all channels had consumed detritus, algae and Chironomidae larvae and there were no differences in gut contents or stable isotope signals (carbon and nitrogen) between treatments, indicating a similar diet among the juveniles across treatments. However, the biomass of chironomids was significantly higher in channels with adult crayfish present, indicating a decreased consumption of chironomids by juveniles in the presence of adults. Our results suggest that the recruitment of juvenile crayfish is mostly affected by habitat complexity. The competition for food and shelter and aggressive interactions between the juveniles were most pronounced in low habitat complexity, indicating that habitats with a good access to shelter will enhance recruitment of juvenile crayfish in streams.","[Olsson, Karin; Nystrom, Per] Lund Univ, Dept Ecol Limnol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Olsson, K (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol Limnol, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",karin.olsson@limnol.lu.se,,,FORMASSwedish Research Council Formas; The Royal Swedish Physiographical Society,"First of all we like to thank Nils and Ulla Jeppson for all their help and for letting us perform the experiment on their land.

Through behavioural flexibility such species may trade off abundant resources with risks, both real and perceived. As highly adaptable mesocarnivores, caracals (Caracal caracal) provide an opportunity to examine development of successful foraging strategies in high-risk developed areas. Here we investigated caracal resource selection of both anthropogenic and environmental factors relative to availability at varying levels of urbanization in and around the city of Cape Town, South Africa, using GPS cluster-located feeding events (n = 326 prey remains, n = 384 scat). We also examined spatial and temporal risk mitigation strategies by assessing behaviours at feeding clusters. We find that, within home ranges, caracals living in the urban-dominated region (n = 14; 548 feeding events) select for the urban edge, while caracals in the wildland-dominated region (n = 3; 162 feeding events) avoid it. Adults selected more strongly for foraging at the urban edge than juveniles and may competitively exclude them from resources. By including back-traced scat feeding event locations, we were able to improve model resolution. We argue that caracals foraging on the edge of a large metropole mitigate risk of detection by remaining cryptic, prolonging handling time, and maintaining high feeding site fidelity where cover was available. Along with the strong functional response to the urban edge, this strategy suggests that carnivores are being drawn into, and stay longer in, areas with potentially increased prey availability despite higher risk. While behavioural plasticity clearly enables carnivore coexistence with humans in urban ecosystems, it can also be maladaptive if it reduces fitness and leads the population into an ecological trap. We provide mitigative recommendations to promote the conservation of this predator in a spatially isolated and rapidly urbanizing landscape.","[Leighton, Gabriella R.

The yak-based transhumant system is influenced by socioeconomic developments, regulations and environmental changes. Little is known about the impact of this on yak farming practices among different regions in Bhutan. Aim and methods.The experienced changes in yak farming practices over the years and perceptions on developments were assessed through interviews with yak herders in three regions (west, n = 22; central, n = 20; east, n = 25) and with livestock extensionists (n = 28). Key results. At present, forage shortage in the rangeland, yak mortality mainly due to (endangered) wild predators and, to a lesser extent, labour availability are the main concerns in all yak farming regions. These concerns have increased due to socioeconomic developments (e.g. education and other sources of income) and strong conservation policy, which affects the living environment of the yaks. Overall, the market to sell yak products and livestock extension services has improved, but forage shortage and yak mortality has increased over the years. However, some factors causing forage shortage are more specific to certain regions, e.g. competition with the horse population (west), cattle and cattle-yak hybrids (east), cordyceps collection (west and central) and prohibited burning of rangelands (central and east). Family labour available to herd yaks has slightly decreased, and the number of young family members (successors) to take over yak farming has decreased over the years. Conclusions. On the basis of the experiences and perceptions of yak herders and extensionists, we conclude that increasing forage shortage in the rangelands, decreasing numbers of successors, and increasing yak predation by wild animals are the major threats to yak farming. Implications. This study demonstrates that yak farming in Bhutan experiences an increasing pressure to sustain. Differences between regions make clear that a one blanket-policy will not be effective to preserve yak farming for the future.","[Dorji, Nedup; Derks, Marjolein; Groot Koerkamp, Peter W.

Individuals of this species have undergone a drastic change in size at maturity in the last years. We investigated mating activity of Humboldt squid in the Gulf of California in 2013, 2014, and 2015 by quantifying spermatangia deposited in the tissue of the buccal area. In 2015, we encountered the smallest mean mantle length of mature specimens recorded to date in the Gulf of California. In all years, numerous males were encountered that had been mated by other males. Spermatangia in males were deposited on the tissue in similar numbers and in the same location as normally occurs in females (the buccal area), suggesting that male-to-male mating behaviour is similar to male-to-female. This behaviour is referred to as same-sex sexual behaviour and has been described for various taxa, including other cephalopods. Overall similarity in mating frequency between males and females and in body size of mated individuals (in 2015) suggests non-discriminative and brief encounters with body size being a cue for mating. This mating strategy may be beneficial for males, as Humboldt squid live in groups where competition for mates is likely high. The energetic costs of male-to-male mating events may be counterbalanced by the fitness profits of indiscriminate mating behaviour.","[Hoving, Henk-Jan T.] Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, GEOMAR, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Fernandez-Alvarez, Fernando A.] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Passeig Maritim 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Fernandez-Alvarez, Fernando A.; Portner, Elan J.; Gilly, William F.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Dept Biol Sci, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA","Hoving, HJT (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, GEOMAR, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",hhoving@geomar.de,"Fernandez-Alvarez, Fernando Angel/B-6196-2014","Fernandez-Alvarez, Fernando Angel/0000-0002-8679-7377; Portner, Elan/0000-0001-9112-863X","Cluster of Excellence 80 The Future Ocean [CP1218]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) [BES-2013-063551, EEBB-I- 15-09631]; Stanford UniversityStanford University; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1557754, OCE-1338973 RAPID, IOS-142093 EAGER, OCE 0850839]; National Geographic Committee for Research and ExplorationNational Geographic Society [7578-04, 9366-13]; Lindblad Expeditions-National Geographic Fund [LXII-15]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-114747]","HJTH was funded by a Grant (CP1218) of the Cluster of Excellence 80 The Future Ocean.

Current theory suggests that an increase in habitat generalist predators in response to landscape change is partially responsible for these declines. However, empirical tests have failed to reach a consensus on how and through what mechanisms landscape change affects nest predation. We tested one hypothesis, the Additive Predation Model, with an artificial nest experiment in fragmented landscapes in southern Queensland, Australia. We employed structural equation modelling of the influence of the relative density of woodland and habitat generalist predators and landscape features at the nest, site, patch and landscape scales on the probability of nest predation. We found little support for the Additive Predation Model, with no significant influence of the density of woodland predators on the probability of nest predation, although landscape features at different spatial scales were important. Within woodlands fragmented by agriculture in eastern Australia, the presence of noisy miner colonies appears to influence ecological processes important for nest predation such that the Additive Predation Model does not hold. In the absence of colonies of the aggressive native bird, the noisy miner, the influence of woodland predators on the risk of artificial nest predation was low compared with that of habitat generalist predators. Outside noisy miner colonies, we found significant edge effects with greater predation rates for artificial nests within woodland patches located closer to the agricultural matrix. Furthermore, the density of habitat generalist predators increased with the extent of irrigated land-use, suggesting that in the absence of noisy miner colonies, nest predation increases with land-use intensity at the landscape scale.","[Robertson, Oliver; Maron, Martine; McAlpine, Clive] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia; [Buckley, Yvonne; McAlpine, Clive] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Buckley, Yvonne] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [House, Alan] Ecosure, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Robertson, O (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia.",olyrobertson@gmail.com,"Maron, Martine/D-9699-2011; Buckley, Yvonne/B-1281-2008","Maron, Martine/0000-0002-5563-5789; Buckley, Yvonne/0000-0001-7599-3201; McAlpine, Clive/0000-0003-0457-8144","Cotton CRCAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme; Stuart Leslie Bird Research Award",These data were collected with permission from the University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee (reference no. 811108) and a scientific purposes (non-protected areas) permit (permit no.

With warming temperatures, lake ecosystems in the Arctic are predicted to change in terms of hydrologic flow, water levels, and connectivity with other lakes. We surveyed lakes in northern Alaska to understand how shifts in the distribution or availability of fish may affect the occupancy and breeding success of Pacific (Gavia pacifica) and Yellow-billed Loons (G. adamsii). We then modeled the influence of the presence and abundance of five fish species and the physical characteristics of lakes (e.g., hydrologic connectivity) on loon lake occupancy and chick production. The presence of Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis) had a positive influence on Pacific Loon occupancy and chick production, which suggests that small-bodied fish species provide important prey for loon chicks. No characteristics of fish species abundance affected Yellow-billed Loon lake occupancy. Instead, Yellow-billed Loon occupancy was influenced by the physical characteristics of lakes that contribute to persistent fish populations, such as the size of the lake and the proportion of the lake that remained unfrozen over winter. Neither of these variables, however, influenced chick production. The probability of an unoccupied territory becoming occupied in a subsequent year by Yellow-billed Loons was low, and no loon chicks were successfully raised in territories that were previously unoccupied. In contrast, unoccupied territories had a much higher probability of becoming occupied by Pacific Loons, which suggests that Yellow-billed Loons have strict habitat requirements and suitable breeding lakes may be limited. Territories that were occupied had high probabilities of remaining occupied for both loon species.","[Uher-Koch, Brian D.; Wright, Kenneth G.; Uher-Koch, Hannah R.; Schmutz, Joel A.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, 4210 Univ Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Uher-Koch, Hannah R.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK USA","Uher-Koch, BD (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, 4210 Univ Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",buher-koch@usgs.gov,,,Biodiversity Research Institute; Bureau of Land Management Arctic Office; Changing Arctic Ecosystems Initiative of the U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystem Mission Area,"We thank the following individuals for field assistance: H.

We developed a mechanistic first passage time model, based on an anisotropic elliptic partial differential equation, and used this to explore how wolf movement responses to seismic lines influence the encounter rate of the wolves with their prey. The model was parametrized using 5 min GPS location data. These data showed that wolves travelled faster on seismic lines and had a higher probability of staying on a seismic line once they were on it. We simulated wolf movement on a range of seismic line densities and drew implications for the rate of predator-prey interactions as described by the functional response. The functional response exhibited a more than linear increase with respect to prey density (type III) as well as interactions with seismic line density. Encounter rates were significantly higher in landscapes with high seismic line density and were most pronounced at low prey densities. This suggests that prey at low population densities are at higher risk in environments with a high seismic line density unless they learn to avoid them.","[McKenzie, Hannah W.; Lewis, Mark A.] Univ Alberta, Ctr Math Biol, Dept Math & Stat Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G1, Canada; [Merrill, Evelyn H.; Lewis, Mark A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Spiteri, Raymond J.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Comp Sci, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C9, Canada","Lewis, MA (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Ctr Math Biol, Dept Math & Stat Sci, 632 CAB, Edmonton, AB T6G 2G1, Canada.",mark.lewis@ualberta.ca,"Spiteri, Raymond/U-7021-2019; Lewis, Mark A/C-5015-2008; Merrill, Evelyn/N-5801-2015","Lewis, Mark A/0000-0002-7155-7426; Merrill, Evelyn/0000-0001-7737-958X",Alberta Ingenuity; NSERC C-GSMNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); University of AlbertaUniversity of Alberta; MITACS Mobility Fund; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [CRO-261091-02]; MITACS Project; Canada Research ChairNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest ServiceCanada Research Chairs; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)King Abdullah University of Science & Technology [KUK-CI013-04],"We wish to acknowledge support from Alberta Ingenuity, NSERC C-GSM, the University of Alberta and the MITACS Mobility Fund (H.W.M.), an NSERC CRO-261091-02 (E.H.M.), NSERC Discovery and MITACS Project Grants (R.J.S.), NSERC Discovery and Accelerator Grants and a Canada Research Chair (M.

However, field-based studies of changes in foraging behavior at fine spatial and temporal scales are rare, particularly among species that feed on highly mobile prey across broad landscapes. To derive information on changes in foraging behavior of breeding brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) over time, we used GPS telemetry and distribution models of their dominant prey species to relate bird movements to changes in foraging habitat quality in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Over the course of each breeding season, pelican cohorts began by foraging in suboptimal habitats relative to the availability of high-quality patches, but exhibited a marked increase in foraging habitat quality over time that outpaced overall habitat improvement trends across the study site. These findings, which are consistent with adjustment of foraging patch use in response to increased energetic need, highlight the degree to which animal populations can optimize their foraging behaviors in the context of uncertain and dynamic resource availability, and provide an improved understanding of how landscape-level features can impact behavior.","[Geary, Brock; Walter, Scott T.; Karubian, Jordan] Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lindy Boggs Ctr 400, 6823 St Charles Ave, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Geary, Brock; Leberg, Paul L.] Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Biol, 410 East St Mary Blvd,108 Billeaud Hall, Lafayette, LA 70503 USA; [Purcell, Kevin M.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Beaufort Lab, Beaufort, NC USA; [Purcell, Kevin M.] Harrisburg Univ Sci & Technol, Data Sci & Analyt Grp, 326 Market St, Harrisburg, PA USA; [Walter, Scott T.] Texas State Univ, Dept Biol, 601 Univ Dr, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA","Geary, B (corresponding author), Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lindy Boggs Ctr 400, 6823 St Charles Ave, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.; Geary, B (corresponding author), Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Dept Biol, 410 East St Mary Blvd,108 Billeaud Hall, Lafayette, LA 70503 USA.",brock.j.geary@gmail.com,,"Geary, Brock/0000-0002-6032-0052","Water Institute of the Gulf [CPRA-2015-COE-EM]; Department of the Treasury through the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority's Center of Excellence Research Grants Program under the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities, and Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast S; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1139962]; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [9370-13]; Tulane Center for Bioenvironmental Research; American Ornithological Society; Animal Behavior Society; Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries; Louisiana SeaGrant Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program; Tulane Newcomb College Institute; Tulane University Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department; Wilson Ornithological Society","This project was funded by The Water Institute of the Gulf under project award number CPRA-2015-COE-EM.

We examined fishes from Colorado River tributaries to address the following questions: Do natives and nonnatives from the same trophic guild consume the same prey items? Will a given species alter its behavior when presented with different prey types? Do different species procure the same prey types via similar feeding behaviors? Roundtail chub (Gila robusta) and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), midwater predators, and Sonora sucker (Catostomus insignis) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio), benthic omnivores, were offered six ecologically relevant prey types in more than 600 laboratory trials. Native species consumed a broader array of prey than nonnatives, and species from a given trophic guild demonstrated functional convergence in key aspects of feeding behavior. For example, roundtail chub and smallmouth bass consume prey attached to the substrate by biting, then ripping the prey from its point of attachment; in contrast, Sonora sucker remove attached prey via scraping. When presented with different prey types, common carp, roundtail chub, and smallmouth bass altered their prey capture behavior by modifying strike distance, gape, and angle of attack. Gape varied among the species examined here, with smallmouth bass demonstrating the largest functional and anatomical gape at a given body size. Because fish predators are gape-limited, smallmouth bass will be able to consume a variety of large prey items in the wild, including large, invasive crayfish and young roundtail chubtheir presumptive trophic competitors.

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between motor display variables of the blue-black grassquit (Volatinia jacarina) and vegetation characteristics. Secondly, we tested if human disturbance (fire and grass mowing) could induce variations in display variables. We modelled two display variables involving conspicuousness and energetic motor investment (i.e., leap duration and rate) to examine their relation to habitat characteristics that reflect vegetation complexity (i.e., grass seed abundance, shadow intensity, vegetation density) and evaluated whether confounding factors (e.g., time of day, territory location and breeding status) influenced this relationship. In a second set of analyses, we assessed the influence of fire and grass mowing upon the bird's display. We found that leap duration increased in contexts of high seed abundance and shadow intensity, and leap rate decreased along the day. Distance from display perches to vegetation patch edge or streets and the presence of an active nest did not predict displays variables. We also show that following a fire event, birds exhibited a lower display rate. Our results indicate that vegetation structure helps to shape the blue-black grassquit display, consistent with the interpretation that courtship exhibitions can signal territory quality. Our findings also show that anthropogenic disturbance can impact a bird's sexual display and underscores the urgency of further studies about the effects of human activities on animals' reproductive behaviors. Significance statement Vegetation characteristics influence resource abundance and provide the backdrop for most animal activities. The degree of vegetation density can either facilitate or confound individuals' daily activities, since vegetation density influences detection by mates, competitors, and predators. Human-induced habitat changes can influence animal communication by modifying vegetation structure and resource distribution. Our objective was to evaluate the relation between motor display variables of a tropical bird and vegetation characteristics and test if human disturbance could induce variations in display variables. We found that displays are influenced by seed abundance and shadow intensity, leap rate is highest at dawn, and fire reduces display rate. Our results indicate that vegetation structure helps in shaping this species' sexual display. We highlight the lack of studies evaluating the influence of human activities on animals' reproductive behaviors.","[Biagolini-Jr, Carlos; Silva-Jr, Edvaldo F.] Univ Brasilia, Programa Posgrad Ecol, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [de Aguiar Silva, Claysson H.; Macedo, Regina H.] Univ Brasilia, Lab Comportamento Anim, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Macedo, Regina H.] Univ Brasilia, Dept Zool, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil","Biagolini, C (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Programa Posgrad Ecol, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",c.biagolini@gmail.com,"; Biagolini-Jr., Carlos/M-5418-2016; Macedo, Regina/C-1411-2013","Silva-Jr, Edvaldo/0000-0003-2685-738X; Aguiar Silva, Claysson/0000-0003-0723-5796; Biagolini-Jr., Carlos/0000-0002-3699-3337; Macedo, Regina/0000-0003-3510-9172",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Animal Behavior Society; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [471945/20137]; Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ecologia from Universidade de Brasilia; Programa de Excelencia Academica PROEX/CAPES [1789/2015],CB received graduate fellowships from Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq).

Here, we explore the necessary conditions for temporal shifts in the relative strength of rodent-plant interactions in an area characterised by profound spatial differences in trophic control, with predator-prey interactions prevailing in productive habitats and rodent-plant interactions dominating unproductive habitats of the forest-tundra ecotone. We report data obtained during the exceptionally massive rodent outbreak of 2010-2012 in northernmost Fennoscandia, including an experimental manipulation of herbivore access to vegetation plots across a large-scale productivity gradient, multiple observational measures of plant-rodent interactions linked to rodent abundance data and a large-scale survey of breeding avian predators and mammalian predator activity. Unexpectedly, rodent grazing impacts documented during the rodent outbreak were uniformly strong across the landscape, regardless of habitat productivity. The runaway response in rodent populations was facilitated by a high population growth rate in the early phase of the outbreak due to the extended absence of predators in productive habitats, concomitant with an exceptionally long-lasting lemming outbreak in unproductive habitats. Our results showed that spatio-temporal variation in trophic control also occurs in ecosystems structured according to the exploitation ecosystems hypothesis and emphasises the importance of long-term studies to capture nonlinear and stochastic features that shape ecosystem functioning. In this context, the temporary release from top-down regulation in productive habitats caused strong grazing impacts that may be crucial for the resilience of tundra ecosystems under the threat of climate change-driven shrub encroachment.","[Hoset, Katrine S.; Ruffino, Lise; Tuomi, Maria; Oksanen, Tarja; Oksanen, Lauri; Makynen, Aurelia] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland; [Oksanen, Tarja; Oksanen, Lauri; Moe, Torunn] Arctic Univ Norway, Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Alta Campus, N-9509 Alta, Norway; [Johansen, Bernt] Northern Res Inst Tromso Norut Tromso, Sci Pk, N-9294 Tromso, Norway","Hoset, KS (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland.",katrine.hoset@nord.no,"Hoset, Katrine S./A-5090-2010","Hoset, Katrine S./0000-0002-1371-012X",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission; University of Turku; University of Tromso; Norden Top-Level Research Initiative Effect Studies and Adaptation to Climate Change,"The study would not have been possible without the help of our devoted field assistants.

I investigated breeding habitat selection in relation to intra-seasonal changes in food availability and reproductive output in red-necked grebes Podiceps grisegena, a size-limited predator, of common carp Cyprinus carpio ponds. Carp farms constitute highly heterogeneous habitat mosaics due to separate stocking of different age/size fish. Pond features significant for grebe settling decisions, i.e. hydroperiod and emergent vegetation cover, had no obvious effects on prey abundance for chicks and on fledging success. Breeding grebes avoided ponds containing fish too large for them to ingest but exhibited little preference between ponds with medium-sized one-year-old carp that could be exploited by pre-laying birds, and ponds designated for young-of-the-year carp, where only invertebrates and amphibians were available as prey in early spring. Red-necked grebes settling on ponds with medium-sized fish failed to predict future shifts in interactions with carp stocks; carp exceeded the prey-size threshold of chicks and adversely affected their non-fish prey levels. The resulting food shortage led to severe egg-to-fledging mortality rates compared to fishless ponds or those containing young-of-the-year fish. This study shows that waterbirds vulnerable to competition from fish can risk maladaptive habitat selection due to unrecognised spatial and temporal variation in food resources caused by fish stocking practices. Ecological traps created by perturbations to trophic interactions may be common but difficult to detect because altered dynamics of trophic resources can affect wildlife indirectly. As with other types of ecological traps, manipulation of habitat features identified as attractive cues for settling animals, but not related to critical food resources, may help to reduce perceptual pitfalls. For example, wetland management to mitigate trap effects driven by commercially stocked fish should preserve abundant emergent vegetation in habitats with weak fish impact and extend their hydroperiod.","Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Inst Biol, Nat Conservat Dept, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland","Kloskowski, J (corresponding author), Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Inst Biol, Nat Conservat Dept, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland.",januszkl@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl,,"Kloskowski, Janusz/0000-0002-0525-2421","State Committee for Scientific ResearchPolish State Committee for Scientific Research [KBN 6PO4F06620, 3PO4F03623]; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [MNiSW 2P04G05030]","I thank the many volunteers and students for their field assistance.

Mitigating the impacts of large-scale fires on biodiversity is becoming increasingly important as their frequency increases. In response, fire managers have engaged with the concept that retaining small unburnt residual areas of vegetation within extensively burnt landscapes may facilitate biodiversity conservation. However, it remains uncertain how the size and isolation of these unburnt residuals influence faunal distributions, persistence and recovery following fire. 2. We used a replicated observation study to test bird responses to the size and isolation of unburnt residuals in a mallee woodland area recently burnt by a 28 000 ha wildfire in southern Australia. The scale of our study provided a rare opportunity to consider the responses of large mobile organisms to fire-induced habitat fragmentation. Within five replicated spatial blocks, we crossed two levels of isolation with large (5-7 ha) and small (1-3 ha) unburnt patches and matrix sites burnt 5 years previously. We compared these site types to six continuous (non-fragmented) unburnt sites. We surveyed each site on eight occasions. 3. Most birds occurred more frequently in unburnt habitat beyond the extent of the fire. Bird responses to the availability and spatial distribution of unburnt remnants within the fire were largely influenced by their ability to use the recently burnt matrix. Occurrence of five species was higher in unburnt residuals when more of the landscape within 500 m was burnt. 4. A fire refuge effect may be likely for two competitive species that occurred more frequently in unburnt residuals than in the burnt matrix or continuous unburnt habitat. For the weebill, recolonization following fire was likely to occur gradually over time from ex situ sources. 5. Synthesis and applications. To maintain avian diversity in fire-prone landscapes, our results suggest a need to shift management focus from creating networks of small unburnt patches towards preserving large, intact areas of habitat. However, five species common to the burnt matrix preferentially selected residual patches when unburnt resources were locally scarce. Therefore, to benefit birds, land managers should limit the extent of applied burns and use narrow burns. When planning large burns, practitioners should consider that a number of species will remain absent from the landscape for several decades.","[Berry, Laurence E.; Lindenmayer, David B.; Driscoll, Don A.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, NERP Environm Decis Hub, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Berry, LE (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, NERP Environm Decis Hub, Frank Fenner Bldg,Linnaeus Way, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",Laurence.Berry@anu.edu.au,"Lindenmayer, David B/P-7183-2017","Lindenmayer, David B/0000-0002-4766-4088; Driscoll, Don/0000-0002-1560-5235",Birds South Australia; South Australian Department of Environment and Natural Resources; Native Vegetation Council of South Australia; Nature Foundation of South Australia; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"This paper benefited from the insightful comments of Jeremy Wilson, Mark Whittingham, Rob Marrs, Phillip Gibbons, David Freudenberg and an anonymous reviewer.

The level of polyandry (defined by the lifetime number of male mates of a female) is an important determinant of the occurrence and intensity of sexual selection acting on male phenotypes. While the forces of sexual selection acting on phenotypic male traits such as body size are relatively well understood, sexual selection acting on phenotypic plasticity of these traits is unexplored. We tackled this issue by scrutinizing the link between polyandry and phenotypic plasticity of male body size in two sympatric plant-inhabiting predatory mite species, Phytoseiulus persimilis and Neoseiulus californicus. These two species are similar in life history, ecological niche requirements, mating behavior, polygyny and female body size plasticity but strikingly differ in the level of both polyandry and phenotypic plasticity of male body size (both lower in P. persimilis). We hypothesized that deviations from standard body size, i.e. the size achieved under favorable conditions, incur higher costs for males in the less polyandrous P. persimilis. To test our hypotheses, we conducted two experiments on (i) the effects of male body size on spermatophore transfer in singly mating females and (ii) the effects of mate sequence (switching the order of standard-sized and small males) on mating behavior and paternity success in doubly mating females. In P. persimilis but not N. californicus, small males transferred fewer but larger spermatophores to the females; in both species, females re-mated more likely with standard-sized following small than small following standard-sized males; in P. persimilis, first standardsized males sired a higher proportion of offspring produced after re-mating by the female than first small males, whereas in N. californicus the paternity success of small and standard- sized males was independent of the mating sequence. Based on our results and pertinent previous studies, which showed that females of P. persimilis, but not N. californicus, prefer mating with standard-sized over small males and allow them fertilizing more eggs, the lack of interspecific difference in female body size plasticity, and the absence of any clue pointing at a role of natural selection, we suggest that the interspecific difference in male body size plasticity is sexually selected. Our study provides an indication of sexual selection constraining plasticity of male phenotypes, suggesting that the level of polyandry may be an important co-determinant of the level of phenotypic plasticity of male body size.","[Schausberger, Peter] Univ Vienna, Dept Behav Biol, Vienna, Austria; [Schausberger, Peter; Walzer, Andreas] Dept Crop Sci, Grp Arthropod Ecol & Behav, Vienna, Austria; [Murata, Yasumasa; Osakabe, Masahiro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Ecol Informat, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto, Japan","Schausberger, P (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Behav Biol, Vienna, Austria.; Schausberger, P (corresponding author), Dept Crop Sci, Grp Arthropod Ecol & Behav, Vienna, Austria.",peter.schausberger@univie.ac.at,"Osakabe, Masahiro/H-8587-2019","Osakabe, Masahiro/0000-0002-2246-3431; Schausberger, Peter/0000-0002-1529-3198","Austria Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 23504-617]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 25876, P 23504] Funding Source: researchfish","This work was financed by a grant from the Austria Science Fund (FWF; P 23504-617) to PS.

Age-intensity data for birds of known age suggest that the rate of parasite uptake increases during the first 6 mo of a bird's life and this increase reflects an increase in feeding rate with age and exhibits no signs of self-cure. Analysis of these age-intensity curves permits us to estimate the transmission rate of the free-living infective stages. Reinfection rates of adults treated to reduce parasite intensities were not significantly different from infection rates of naive immature grouse. Secondary infections continued to rise over a period of 18 mo and this suggests that there is no strong host-mediated response against the parasite. Any density-dependent reduction in parasite fecundity is probably very weak and would act through interspecific competition between parasites. Initial analysis of worm egg production in relation to the intensity of worm infection found weak evidence of density-dependent suppression of egg production at high worm intensities. However, a more rigorous analysis found that such a relationship suffered from Type I errors and was a consequence of the aggregated distribution of the parasites. Any density-dependent suppression of parasite egg production is too weak to be detected and would only occur at high worm intensities. The potential density-dependent reductions in fecundity on the population dynamics of T. tenuis and red grouse are examined using a mathematical model. The model suggests that the presence of density-dependent reductions in worm fecundity could produce significant reductions in the propensity of the grouse-nematode system to exhibit population cycles. The sustained cycles observed in the long-term dynamics of the grouse populations in the study area suggest that density-dependent reductions in worm fecundity and establishment are either absent or only operating at levels that are not detectable in field studies.","GAME CONSERVANCY, UPLAND RES GRP, NEWTONMORE PH20 1BE, INVERNESS, SCOTLAND",,,"Hudson, Peter/AAB-8080-2020","Hudson, Peter/0000-0003-0468-3403",,,,46,39,39,1,32,ALLEN PRESS INC,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0022-3395,1937-2345,,J PARASITOL,J.

Protected areas are critical for conserving large carnivores, but increasing human-wildlife conflict, tourism, and human population growth near these sanctuaries may have negative effects on the carnivores within sanctuary borders. Our goals were to investigate how anthropogenic disturbance along the edge of the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, influences the demography and space-use of two large carnivore species that engage in intense interspecific competition. Here we document, in one disturbed region of the Reserve, a rapid increase in the population size of one large predator, the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), but a striking concurrent decline in numbers of another, the African lion (Panthera leo). Anthropogenic disturbances negatively affected lion populations, and decreasing lion numbers appear to have a positive effect on hyena populations, indicated here by an increase in juvenile survivorship. We also saw an increase in the number of livestock consumed by hyenas. Our results suggest human population growth and indirect effects of human activity along Reserve boundaries may be effecting a trophic cascade inside the Reserve itself. These results indicate both top-down and bottom-up processes are causing a shift in the carnivore community, and a major disruption of guild structure, inside the boundaries of one of the most spectacular protected areas in Africa.","[Green, D.

Ocean acidification (OA) reduces the growth of recruiting benthic invertebrates, yet no direct effects on survivorship have been demonstrated. We tested whether the reduced growth of coral recruits caused by OA would increase their mortality by prolonging their vulnerability to an acute disturbance: fish herbivory on surrounding algal turf. After two months' growth in ambient or elevated CO2 levels, the linear extension and calcification of coral (Acropora millepora) recruits decreased as CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) increased. When recruits were subjected to incidental fish grazing, their mortality was inversely size dependent. However, we also found an additive effect of pCO(2) such that recruit mortality was higher under elevated pCO(2) irrespective of size. Compared to ambient conditions, coral recruits needed to double their size at the highest pCO(2) to escape incidental grazing mortality. This general trend was observed with three groups of predators (blenny, surgeonfish, and parrotfish), although the magnitude of the fish treatment varied among species. Our study demonstrates the importance of size-escape thresholds in early recruit survival and how OA can shift these thresholds, potentially intensifying population bottlenecks in benthic invertebrate recruitment.","[Doropoulos, Christopher; Ward, Selina; Marshell, Alyssa; Mumby, Peter J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Diaz-Pulido, Guillermo] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Diaz-Pulido, Guillermo] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia","Doropoulos, C (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",c.doropoulos@uq.edu.au,"Diaz-Pulido, Guillermo/B-3648-2013; Marshell, Alyssa/K-1145-2013; Mumby, Peter/F-9914-2010; Doropoulos, Christopher/B-7249-2016","Marshell, Alyssa/0000-0003-0841-9028; Mumby, Peter/0000-0002-6297-9053; Doropoulos, Christopher/0000-0001-8038-2771; Diaz-Pulido, Guillermo/0000-0002-0901-3727",Danielle Simmons Award; Winifred Violet Scott Foundation; QLD Smart Future Scholarship; University of QueenslandUniversity of Queensland; ARC Discovery GrantAustralian Research Council; ARC Laureate FellowshipAustralian Research Council,"We are grateful to M.

It still needs to be determined whether this is a direct effect of single species or an indirect effect of shifts in soil microbial community assemblages. Evaluation of the soil microbiome as a whole is critical for understanding multi-trophic interactions, including those mediated by volatiles involving plants, herbivorous insects, predators/parasitoids and microorganisms. We implemented a regulated system comprising Nerium oleander plants grown in soil initially containing a sterile/non sterile inoculum, herbivore Aphis nerii and predator Chrysoperla carnea. After aphid attack, plants emitted a characteristic blend of volatiles derived from two biosynthetic classes: fatty acid catabolites and aromatic-derived products. Three aliphatic compounds were mainly detected in plants grown in the inoculated microbial soil, a blend which was preferentially chosen by C. carnea adult females. The contrasting effect of the initial inocula was attributed to the different microbial consortia developed in each treatment. We argue that differences in the relative abundance of the active microbial communities in the rhizosphere correlate with those in the emission of selected volatile compounds by attacked plants. The mechanisms involved in how the functional soil microbiome modulates inducible indirect defence of plants are discussed.","[Benitez, Emilio; Paredes, Daniel; Aldana, Diana; Nogales, Rogelio; Campos, Mercedes; Moreno, Beatriz] CSIC, EEZ, E-18008 Granada, Spain; [Gonzalez, Monica] Cajamar, Estn Expt Las Palmerillas, Almeria, Spain; [Rodriguez, Estefania] Ctr IFAPA La Mojonera, Inst Invest & Formac Agr & Pesquera, Almeria, Spain","Benitez, E (corresponding author), CSIC, EEZ, E-18008 Granada, Spain.",benitez@eez.csic.es,"Paredes, Daniel/A-2183-2009; Benitez, Emilio/L-3110-2014; Navarro, Estefania Rodriguez/C-3183-2016; Moreno, Beatriz/L-2993-2014; Campos, Mercedes/L-6323-2014","Paredes, Daniel/0000-0002-2681-2256; Benitez, Emilio/0000-0002-8435-066X; Navarro, Estefania Rodriguez/0000-0003-0083-2950; Moreno, Beatriz/0000-0001-5799-9802; Gonzalez-Fernandez, Monica/0000-0002-6832-4074; Campos, Mercedes/0000-0003-4313-7069","ERDF-RECUPERA from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness-CSIC; Junta de Andalucia, SpainJunta de Andalucia [AGR 1419]","This work was supported by ERDF-cofinanced grant RECUPERA 2020 from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness-CSIC and Project AGR 1419 from Junta de Andalucia, Spain.

Behavioral consistency has been shown to affect dispersal, foraging, exploration, and antipredator responses, which may have an impact on parental and offspring survival. Despite increasing research in behavioral consistency, the repeatability of nest defense behavior has rarely been assessed in wild bird populations. Furthermore, previous studies investigating nest defense behavior have utilized laboratory studies or mounted predators to elicit defensive behavior. It is important to assess personality in wild populations to fully understand the fitness consequences of behavioral consistency across natural contexts and to utilize live predators or competitors for accurate assessment of defensive behavior. We used an ecologically relevant, live, invasive, nest site competitor, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), to elicit nest defense behavior in a wild population of Eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) to determine if nest defense behavior is repeatable within and between years for males and females (males: 2009, N = 17; 2010, N = 18; both years, N = 9. Females: 2009, N = 22; 2010, N = 15; both years, N = 11). We also determined if individual behavior changes as a function of season, parental age, brood size, or the number of house sparrows around the nest site. We found that females demonstrated repeatable behavior both within and between years. Male nest defense behavior was only repeatable in 1 year and was influenced by season in the other year. Parental age, brood size, and the number of house sparrows around the nest site did not affect nest defense behavior. We conclude that Eastern bluebirds demonstrate consistent nest defense behavior, or personality, although males are more plastic than females.","[Burtka, Jennifer L.; Grindstaff, Jennifer L.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Zool, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Burtka, JL (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Zool, 501 Life Sci West, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",jay.burtka@okstate.edu,,,Bob and Julia Bollinger; Oklahoma Ornithological Society; Payne County Audubon Society; Department of Zoology at Oklahoma State University,"We would like to thank our field technicians and volunteers for help with this project, in particular Emily Clark, Erin LaVasque, and Brian Hidden.

Although the dynamics of subgrouping are not well understood, evidence of facultative fission-fusion behavior in species that generally exhibit a highly cohesive group structure may help to clarify the set of ecological and social factors that constrain or affect group size in primates. We here examined patterns of subgrouping in Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) inhabiting the Baimaxueshan National Nature Reserve in Yunnan, China. Rhinopithecus bieti lives in a large multilevel society consisting of 6-41 one-male, multifemale units (OMUs) and one all-male unit (AMU). Over a 5-yr period from 2003 through 2008, we tracked a group of > 450 Rhinopithecus bieti. We recorded the location in the group's home range where fission and fusion events occurred, the size and number of subgroups, days spent in subgroups, and food availability, and monitored predator sightings. The results indicate that the focal group underwent12 group fission events, all of which occurred between mid-June and July, and all in the same area of the group's range. During these fissioning events, the AMU also showed subgrouping behavior. In all cases, the presence of bamboo shoots, an important seasonal component of the snub-nosed monkey diet, appeared to trigger subgrouping behavior. The subgroups reunited in other parts of their range after a period of 2-11 d. We found no evidence that the presence of predators had a direct affect on subgrouping behavior in Rhinopithecus bieti, as proposed in previous studies.","[Ren, Baoping; Li, Dayong; Li, Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Dayong] China W Normal Univ, Coll life Sci, Nanchong 637002, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Garber, Paul A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Anthropol, Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Ren, BP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",renbp@ioz.ac.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30970442]; project of Public Benefit [201104073],"This study was funded by the project of Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 30970442) and the project of Public Benefit (201104073).

In order for plasticity to be adaptive, induced defences should incur a benefit to the organism in, for example, decreased risk of predation. However, the production of defence traits may include costs in fitness components such as growth, time to reproduction, or fecundity. To test the hypothesis that the expression of phenotypic plasticity incurs costs, we performed a common garden experiment with a freshwater snail, Radix balthica, a species known to change morphology in the presence of molluscivorous fish. We measured a number of predator-induced morphological and behavioural defence traits in snails that we reared in the presence or absence of chemical cues from fish. Further, we quantified the costs of plasticity in fitness characters related to fecundity and growth. Since plastic responses may be inhibited under limited resource conditions, we reared snails in different densities and thereby levels of competition. Snails exposed to predator cues grew rounder and thicker shells, traits confirmed to be adaptive in environments with fish. Defence traits were consistently expressed independent of density, suggesting strong selection from predatory molluscivorous fish. However, the expression of defence traits resulted in reduced growth rate and fecundity, particularly with limited resources.

Bioassay choice experiments used to determine food preferences in animals often consider single factors only but foraging decisions can be influenced by multiple factors such as the quantity and quality of the food and the wood as a medium for communication. A statistical analysis framework is developed here to design a single bioassay experiment to study multifactorial foraging choice (Pinus radiata) in the basal Australian termite species Coptotermes (C.) acinaciformis (Isoptera: Rhi-notermitidae). By employing a correlation analysis, 17 measured physical properties of 1417 Pinus radiata veneer discs were reduced to five key material properties: density, moisture absorption, early wood content, first resonance frequency and damping. By applying a fuzzy c-means clustering technique, these veneer discs were optimally paired for treatment and control trials to study food preference by termites based on these five key material properties. A multifactorial analysis of variance was compared to a permutation analysis of the results indicating for the first time that C. acinaciformis takes into account multiple factors when making foraging decisions. C. acinaciformis prefer denser wood with large early wood content, preferably humid and highly damped. Results presented here have practical implications for food choice experiments and for studies concerned with communication in termites as well as their ecology and coevolution with trees as their major food source.","[Oberst, Sebastian] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Audio Acoust & Vibrat, Sch Software, Fac Engn & IT, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Lai, Joseph C.

In the course of priming effects large amounts of C, N and other nutrients can be released or immobilized in soil in a very short time. These effects have been measured in many field and laboratory experiments; however, only a few of the studies were aimed at an extended investigation of the mechanisms of such phenomena. The aim of this overview is to reveal possible causes and processes leading to priming actions using the references on agricultural ecosystems and model experiments. Multiple mechanisms and sources of released C and N are presented and summarized in Tables for positive and negative real and apparent priming effects induced after the addition of different organic and mineral substances to the soil. Soil microbial biomass plays the key role in the processes leading to the real priming effects. The most important mechanisms for the real priming effects are the acceleration or retardation of soil organic matter turnover due to increased activity or amount of microbial biomass. Isotopic exchange, pool substitution, and different uncontrolled losses of mineralized N from the soil are responsible for the apparent N priming effects. Other multiple mechanisms (predation, competition for nutrients between roots and microorganisms, preferred uptake, inhibition, etc.) in response to addition of different substances are also discussed. These mechanisms can be distinguished from each other by the simultaneous monitoring df C and N release dynamics; its comparison with the course of microbial activity; and by the labelling of different pools with C-14 or C-13 and N-15. Quantitative methods for describing priming effects and their dynamics using C-14 and N-15 isotopes, as well as for non-isotopic studies are proposed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Several conservation initiatives are aiming to improve the status of the rapidly dwindling populations of tiger Panthera tigris. However, possible cascading effects of intra-guild competition on other sympatric carnivores are rarely considered while planning such recovery programmes. 2. In this study, we examine how, following the reduction of anthropogenic pressures by relocation of pastoralists, a recovering tiger population affects leopards Panthera pardus in the Chilla Range of Rajaji National Park (RNP), India. By combining data gathered over 4 years (2004-2005 to 2007-2008) on prey availability, food habits and population density of the two predators, we investigate some of the mechanisms of niche partitioning. 3. Based on existing information, we predicted that there would be high dietary overlap between the two predators. Over time, optimal habitats would be dominated by tigers forcing leopards to the periphery of the protected area where they would subsist on small prey and domestic livestock. Consequently, leopards would occur at a lower density where sympatric with tigers. 4. Our results confirmed that annual dietary overlap (0 center dot 89, 0 center dot 82, 0 center dot 78, 0 center dot 77) between the two predators was high during the study. As expected, we observed a shift in the diet of leopards towards a significantly higher intake of domestic prey (similar to 6 center dot 8% to similar to 31 center dot 8%) and small prey (similar to 9% to similar to 36%). Mean leopard density declined from 9 center dot 76 animals per 100 km2 in 2004-2005 to 2 center dot 07 per 100 km2 in 2007-2008, while the mean density of tigers increased from 3 center dot 31 per 100 km2 to 5 center dot 81 per 100 km2 over the same period. 5. Synthesis and applications. Although based on small sample sizes, our study revealed that over the 4 years following the relocation of pastoralists out of RNP, the tiger population recovered but leopard densities declined sharply. The concurrent shift in leopard diet indicated heightened livestock depredation from the surrounding area. Therefore, it is important that conservation initiatives targeting the recovery of tigers should be preceded by careful examination of interspecific interactions with sympatric carnivores. Comprehensive human-carnivore conflict management measures like monitoring the extent of livestock depredation, improving livestock management and providing adequate compensation and/or insurance schemes are critical for successfully implementing such conservation efforts.","[Harihar, Abishek; Pandav, Bivash; Goyal, Surendra P.] Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Harihar, Abishek] Univ Kent, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Dept Anthropol, Canterbury CT2 7NR, Kent, England","Harihar, A (corresponding author), Wildlife Inst India, POB 18, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",harihar.abishek@gmail.com,"Harihar, Abishek/AAY-5092-2020","Harihar, Abishek/0000-0002-2446-6345",Save the Tiger Fund; WII; WWF-International; Kaplan Graduate Award; Kathryn Fuller Doctoral Fellowship,"We wish thank the Director and Dean of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and the Uttarakhand Forest Department for providing permissions.

We currently have a poor understanding of how increased drought will change the functioning of tropical rain forest. In particular, tropical rain forest invertebrates, which are numerous and biologically important, may respond to drought in different ways across trophic levels. Ants are a diverse group that carry out important ecosystem processes, shaping ecosystem structure and function through predation and competition, which can influence multiple trophic levels. Hemiptera are a mega-diverse order, abundant in tropical rain forests and are ecologically important. To understand the roles of ants in exerting predation and competition pressure on invertebrates in tropical rain forests during drought and a post-drought period, we established a large-scale ecosystem manipulation experiment in Maliau Basin Conservation Area in Malaysian Borneo, suppressing the activity of ants on four 0.25 ha plots over a two-year period. We sampled hemipterans found in the leaf litter during a drought (July 2015) and a post-drought period (September 2016) period. We found significant shifts in the assemblage of hemipterans sampled from the leaf litter following ant suppression. Specifically, for ant-suppression plots, the species richness and abundance of herbivorous hemipterans increased only during the post-drought period. For predatory hemipterans, abundance increased with ant-suppression regardless of drought conditions, and we found marginal evidence for a species richness increase during the post-drought period with little or no change in the drought period. These results illustrate how ants in tropical forests structure invertebrate communities and how these effects may vary with climatic variation. in Malay is available with online material.","[Goldman, Anna E.; Bonebrake, Timothy C.; Tsang, Toby P.

Our goals were to identify important habitats for conservation at each spatial scale (cell size) using candidate variables shown to be important by previous research. As expected, across all scales, badger occurrence was consistently and strongly correlated with dominance of cork oak and deciduous woodlands, and badgers seemed to avoid cultivated fields. Contrary to expectation, monocultures of conifers contributed positively to badger detection. The predictive ability of the models was poor at all scales, probably owing to our inability to include factors such as food, competitors, predators, undercover vegetation, and roads. Nonetheless, the models illustrate the importance to badgers of the montado, an ancient human-modified ecosystem that is threatened by current European Union agricultural conversion policies.","[Santos, Maria J.] No Arizona Univ, Ctr Environm Sci & Educ, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Beier, Paul] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Beier, Paul] No Arizona Univ, Merriam Powell Ctr Environm Res, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA","Santos, MJ (corresponding author), Dept Land Air & Water Resources, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",mjsantos@ucdavis.edu,"Beier, Paul/K-9294-2013; Santos, Maria Joao/M-5034-2013","Beier, Paul/0000-0002-4297-4343; Santos, Maria Joao/0000-0002-6558-7477",Luso-American Foundation for Development (FLAD),"We thank the Luso-American Foundation for Development (FLAD) for funding, and the following institutions and people for providing data: CBA, CNIG, ICN, Evora University, and CEAI, Dr Margarida Santos-Reis, Dr Antonio Mira, Dr Luis Miguel Rosalino, Filipa Loureiro, Hugo Matos, Nuno Pedroso, Teresa Sales-Luis, Iris Pereira, Joaquim Pedro Ferreira, Bruno Pinto, Silvia Carvalho, Sonia Domingos, Joao Tiago Marques, Rita Alcazar, Margarida Lopes Fernandes and Fernando Ascensao for additional data.

There are a number of hypotheses about the conditions that select for mixotrophy, and field studies have documented the prevalence of mixotrophy in a range of environments. However, there is currently little evidence for how mixotrophy varies across environmental gradients, and whether empirical patterns support theoretical predictions. Here I synthesize experiments that have quantified the abundance of phototrophic, mixotrophic, and heterotrophic nanoflagellates, to ask whether there are broad patterns in the prevalence of mixotrophy (relative to pure autotrophy and heterotrophy), and to ask whether observed patterns are consistent with a trait-based model of trophic strategies. The data suggest that mixotrophs increase in abundance at lower latitudes, while autotrophs and heterotrophs do not, and that this may be driven by increased light availability. Both mixotrophs and autotrophs increase greatly in productive coastal environments, while heterotrophs increase only slightly. These patterns are consistent with a model of resource competition in which nutrients and carbon can both limit growth and mixotrophs experience a trade-off in allocating biomass to phagotrophy vs. autotrophic functions. Importantly, mixotrophy is selected for under a range of conditions even when mixotrophs experience a penalty for using a generalist trophic strategy, due to the synergy between photosynthetically derived carbon and prey-derived nutrients. For this reason mixotrophy is favored relative to specialist strategies by increased irradiance, while at the same time increased nutrient supply increases the competitive ability of mixotrophs against heterotrophs.","[Edwards, Kyle F.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Edwards, KF (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",kfe@hawaii.edu,,", Kyle/0000-0002-0661-3903",NSF OCENational Science Foundation (NSF) [1559356]; Simons Foundation Early Career Investigator Award in Marine Microbial Ecology and Evolution,This work was supported by NSF OCE Grant 1559356 and a Simons Foundation Early Career Investigator Award in Marine Microbial Ecology and Evolution (to K.F.E.).,,52,20,20,1,24,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Detailed field research traces the role of social networks in the economic organization of two dynamic informal enterprise clusters in the town of Aba in south-eastern Nigeria, an area renowned for the density of its popular economic networks and for the rapid development of small-scale manufacturing under Nigeria's structural adjustment programme. Focusing on the role of embedded social institutions and their restructuring amid the competitive pressures of rapid liberalization, I consider the extent to which social networks in Aba constitute 'social capital' capable of promoting economic development in the context of ongoing liberalization, 'social liabilities' that undermine accumulation through a social logic of redistribution and parochialism, or 'political capital' through which popular forces are incorporated into the 'shadow structures' of predatory states. This article challenges the essentialism of much of the contemporary literature on African social networks, arguing for a sharper focus on the specific institutional capacities of indigenous economic institutions.

Factors influencing oviposition site selection include a female's own predation risk and nutritional needs, as well as the performance of offspring. Trade-offs may occur when oviposition sites differ in their favorability for these fitness-related functions. Adults of the leaf-mining moth, Phyllocnistis populiella, forage at the extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) of quaking aspen, Populus tremuloides. Females are synovigenic and likely rely on adult nutrition for egg production; however, proximity to EFNs may be associated with reduced offspring survival. In a controlled experiment, when given the choice of oviposition on either a leaf with or without EFNs, P. populiella preferred leaves lacking EFNs. Seven years of field survey data revealed significantly higher oviposition and lower egg predation on leaves lacking EFNs. Aspen shoots with a higher proportion of leaves expressing EFNs experienced higher oviposition but no difference in egg predation. At the leaf level, eggs were overdispersed when at low to moderate densities, likely to decrease interference competition. Females mated multiply, and the acquisition of spermatophores through repeated matings may decrease P. populiella's reliance on EF nectar for egg production. P. populiella appears to balance the trade-off between resource rich and high offspring performance sites by ovipositing in neighborhoods with a high proportion of leaves bearing EFNs, while preferring leaves lacking EFNs which experience lower egg predation.","[Dennis, Russell; Doak, Patricia; Wagner, Diane] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Doak, Patricia; Wagner, Diane] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA","Doak, P (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",pdoak@alaska.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0543632]; Institute of Arctic Biology; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1026415] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"Funding was provided by a National Science Foundation award (DEB 0543632) to DW and PD and by the 2010 Institute of Arctic Biology Graduate Student Summer Research Fellowship to RD.

Although less well documented, nest raiding by invasive ants may also contribute to the extirpation of native ants. In coastal southern California, for example, invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) commonly raid colonies of the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex subnitidus. On a seasonal basis the frequency and intensity of raids vary, but raids occur only when abiotic conditions are suitable for both species. In the short term these organized attacks cause harvester ants to cease foraging and to plug their nest entrances. In unstaged, one-on-one interactions between P. subnitidus and L. humile workers, Argentine ants behaved aggressively in over two thirds of all pair-wise interactions, despite the much larger size of P. subnitidus. The short-term introduction of experimental Argentine ant colonies outside of P. subnitidus nest entrances stimulated behaviors similar to those observed in raids: P. subnitidus decreased its foraging activity and increased the number of nest entrance workers (many of which labored to plug their nest entrances). Raids are not likely to be the result of competition for food. As expected, P. subnitidus foraged primarily on plant material (85% of food items obtained from returning foragers), but also collected some dead insects (7% of food items). In buffet-style choice tests in which we offered Argentine ants food items obtained from P. subnitidus, L. humile only showed interest in dead insects. In other feeding trials L. humile consistently moved harvester ant brood into their nests (where they were presumably consumed) but showed little interest in freshly dead workers. The raiding behavior described here obscures the distinction between interspecific competition and predation, and may well play an important role in the displacement of native ants, especially those that are ecologically dissimilar to L. humile with respect to diet.","Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Ecol Behav & Evolut, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Univ Michigan, Sch Art & Design, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Holway, D (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Ecol Behav & Evolut, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",dholway@ucsd.edu,,,,,,29,27,28,0,19,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",0020-1812,1420-9098,,INSECT SOC,Insect.

These reservoir communities differ dramatically from northern lakes in that an open-water omnivore, gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), often occurs in abundance. Neither controlled by fish predators (owing to high fecundity and low vulnerability) nor by their zooplankton prey (following the midsummer zooplankton decline, gizzard shad consume detritus and phytoplankton), gizzard shad regulate community composition rather than being regulated by top-down or bottom-up forces. In experiments across a range of spatial scales (enclosures, 1-9 m(2); ponds, 4-5 ha; and reservoirs, 50-100 ha), we evaluated the generality of the trophic cascade hypothesis by assessing its conceptual strength in reservoir food webs. We reviewed the role of gizzard shad in controlling zooplankton populations and hence recruitment of bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus (via exploitative competition for zooplankton), and largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides (by reducing their bluegill prey). Reservoir fish communities, owing to the presence of gizzard shad, appear to be regulated more by complex weblike interactions among species than by the more chainlike interactions characteristic of the trophic cascade.","AUBURN UNIV,DEPT FISHERIES & ALLIED AQUACULTURES,AUBURN,AL 36849","Stein, RA (corresponding author), OHIO STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,AQUAT ECOL LAB,1735 NEIL AVE,COLUMBUS,OH 43212, USA.",,,,,,,122,155,160,4,77,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0706-652X,,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

The use of Type VI Secretion Systems (T6SS), a protein secretion apparatus used as a molecular weapon for interbacterial competition and eukaryotic interactions, is one of the competitive strategies that is least studied among heterotrophic bacteria living in the water column. To get an insight into the temporal and spatial distribution of bacteria with T6SS in this portion of the marine environment, we examine the presence and abundance of T6SS-bearing bacteria at both local and global scales through the use of metagenome data from water samples obtained from the coast of Monterey Bay and the TARA Oceans project. We also track the abundance of T6SS-harboring bacteria through a two-year time series of weekly water samples in the same coastal site to examine the environmental factors that may drive their presence and abundance. Among the twenty-one T6SS-bearing bacterial genera examined, we found several genera assume a particle-attached lifestyle, with only a few genera having a free-living lifestyle. The abundance of T6SS-harboring bacteria in both niches negatively correlates with the abundance of autotrophs. Globally, we found that T6SS genes are much more abundant in areas with low biological productivity. Our data suggest that T6SS-harboring bacteria tend to be abundant spatially and temporally when organic resources are limited. This ecological study agrees with the patterns observed from several in vitro studies; that T6SS could be an adaptive strategy employed by heterotrophic bacteria to obtain nutrients or reduce competition when resources are in limited quantity.","[Sison-Mangus, Marilou P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Sison-Mangus, MP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",msisonma@ucsc.edu,,"Sison-Mangus, Marilou/0000-0002-6569-9380",Myers Trust; TARA Oceans project,"The authors thank Sanjin Mehic and Terrill Yazzie for their contributions to sample collection, and Jiunn Fong for his support throughout the experiments.

This is because they are numerous and have higher growth rates compared to other unicellular eukaryotes of similar size. Predation and competition are some of the factors that negatively affect their abundance and growth. Studies documenting the impact of predation by zooplankton on ciliates have been conducted in marine and freshwaters waters but are lacking in tropical waters especially soda lakes in Kenya. In this study, growth rates of planktonic ciliates were estimated in four soda lakes, Lakes Bogoria, Elmenteita, Simbi and Sonachi, using predator exclusion experiments. In the experiments, ciliate populations increased faster in incubations of lake water with the >40 mm fraction removed than in untreated controls. The difference in these rates was taken as an estimate of predation by zooplankton >40 mm ( M z), and ranged from 0.091 to 3.171 d(-1). Our best estimates of growth rates for particular ciliates abundant enough to derive estimates for ranged from 0.18 to 4.78 d(-1). When removing the >40 mm fraction did not result in increased numbers of ciliates relative to controls, we hypothesized that this was due to predators within the <40 mm fraction (M-c) and their release from zooplankton predators. We assessed and supported this hypothesis by looking at the production of ciliates in different feeding guilds. The significance of predation on ciliates to the food webs of soda lakes is discussed.","[Yasindi, Andrew W.] Egerton Univ, Dept Biol Sci, POB 536, Nakuru 20115, Kenya; [Taylor, William D.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Yasindi, AW (corresponding author), Egerton Univ, Dept Biol Sci, POB 536, Nakuru 20115, Kenya.",ayasindi@yahoo.com,,,"Rockfeller African Dissertation Internship Award (ADIA) [785, 96022]; NSERC Canada Research Grant","This research was supported by a Rockfeller African Dissertation Internship Award (ADIA) (REF 96022 no. 785, a Commonwealth Scholarship to AWY and an NSERC Canada Research Grant to WDT.

One trade-off may be between ovipositing with predators and ovipositing with competitors. Many amphibians show risk-sensitive oviposition and select oviposition sites based on offspring performance. We examined differential oviposition and offspring success by gray treefrogs (Hyla versicolor) in response to the presence of caged or free-ranging invasive western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) using cattletank mesocosms as experimental ponds. Our experiment sought to answer these questions by comparing the number of eggs laid and tadpoles produced among the experimental treatments: (1) Do gray treefrogs exhibit risk-sensitive oviposition? and (2) What is the relative importance of pre-colonization and post-colonization consumptive and trait-mediated effects of western mosquitofish? Gray treefrogs laid more eggs in control and caged predator mesocosms than in free-ranging predator mesocosms. At the end of the experiment, there were more tadpoles in control and caged predator mesocosms than in free-ranging predator mesocosms. Proportional yield was lower in free-ranging predator mesocosms than control and caged predator mesocosms. Eggs were laid 7-8 d earlier in control mesocosms than caged and free-ranging predator mesocosms. Western mosquitofish therefore had a negative effect on the successful colonization of experimental ponds by gray treefrogs, most likely through direct physical interactions. Our results also suggest gray treefrogs shift oviposition preferences as the number of conspecifics reaches a threshold where competition risk outweighs predation risk. Western mosquitofish therefore have great potential to affect the distribution of gray treefrogs through pre- and post-colonization effects.","[Smith, Geoffrey R.; Harmon, Johanna J.] Denison Univ, Dept Biol, Granville, OH 43023 USA","Smith, GR (corresponding author), Denison Univ, Dept Biol, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",smithg@denison.edu,,,Arend-McBride Endowment of Denison University,"We thank R.

Importantly, spatial dynamics can be deeply affected by rapid evolution depending on the ecological context. Using experimental evolution in replicated microcosm landscapes and numerical analyses we show experimentally that the ecological process of range expansions leads to the evolution of increased dispersal. This evolutionary change counter-intuitively feeds back on (macro-) ecological patterns affecting the spatial distribution of population densities. While existing theory suggests that densities decrease from range cores to range margins due to K-selection, we show the reverse to be true when competition is considered explicitly including resource dynamics. We suggest that a dispersal-foraging trade-off, leading to more 'prudent' foraging at range margins, is the driving mechanism behind the macroecological pattern reported. In conclusion, rapid multi-trait evolution and eco-evolutionary feedbacks are highly relevant for understanding macroecological patterns and designing appropriate conservation strategies.","[Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Altermatt, Florian] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Altermatt, Florian] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Fronhofer, EA (corresponding author), Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",emanuel.fronhofer@eawag.ch,"Fronhofer, Emanuel A./AAY-3186-2021; Fronhofer, Emanuel A./J-9784-2013","Fronhofer, Emanuel A./0000-0002-2219-784X; Fronhofer, Emanuel A./0000-0002-2219-784X; Altermatt, Florian/0000-0002-4831-6958","Eawag; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [31003A_135622, PP00P3_150698]","We would like to thank Pravin Ganesanandamoorthy for help with performing the experiments.

Biotic interactions rather than morphological constraints are considered to underlie this pattern. We investigated whether the preference of the larvae of the damselfly Enallagma cyathigerum for a particular habitat was retained in absence of prey, predators and/or conspecifics. A series of laboratory choice experiments was conducted in which combinations of sediment and artificial plants differing in structural complexity were offered simultaneously to the larvae. Larvae preferred patches with structurally complex vegetation over patches with simply structured vegetation or lacking vegetation. Patches with simply structured vegetation were preferred over those with bare sediment, but the number of larvae showing a clear choice, which is regarded as an indication of the strength of the preference for a particular habitat, was relatively low compared to the number of individuals responding when complex vegetation was present. Based on the results presented, we conclude that the preference of E. cyathigerum larvae for structurally complex vegetation is independent of the presence of predators, prey or competitors. This suggests that this behaviour of the larvae is either learned or an innate response.","[Verdonschot, Ralf C.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the biological parameters associated with the interaction Apis mellifera x Baccharis dracunculifolia, to elucidate the supply of resin for green propolis production in Minas Gerais. We selected male and female individuals of two populations of Baccharis dracunculifolia located on Sao Judas Tadeu Farm - FSJT, in the municipality of Betim, MG and the Experimental Garden of the Ezequiel Dias Foundation - HORTO, located in an urban area in Belo Horizonte, MG. We made weekly observations, from June 2007 to June 2008, and evaluated in both populations: richness and abundance of insect visitors; resin collecting visits of Apis mellifera; presence of Baccharopelma dracunculifoliae galls; growth of individuals and phenological phases. Statistical analyses were made using R software. The rainy season showed the highest number of visitors. A. mellifera collected resin in shoot apices of Baccharis dracunculifolia from August to April, only in the FSJT population, where galls of B. dracunculifoliae were also present. Ovoposition of gall inductor on host plants occurs during the rainy season, when there is a peak of visitants and resin collecting visits of honeybees. This fact stimulates plant defense strategies against parasitoids and predators, which includes the production of several secondary metabolites, and ultimately reduces competition for food by inhibiting the attack of other phytophagous insects, not adapted to the chemical environment of plant tissues. Green propolis production in Minas Gerais is related to the abundant supply of resin by Baccharis dracunculifolia, when they are parasitised by B. dracunculifoliae galls. They induce plant production of defense exudates, which attract Apis mellifera bees to collect resin and consequently favour the production of green propolis.","[Bastos, E. M. A. F.; Santana, R.

But it's the rotten ones that now tempt commercial, governmental, and consumer interests to threaten the Internet's uniquely creative power. The expediently selected, almost accidentally generative properties of the Internet - its technical openness, ease of access and mastery, and adaptability - have combined, especially when coupled with those of the PC, to produce an unsurpassed environment for innovative experiment. Those same properties, however, also make the Internet hospitable to various forms of wickedness: hacking, porn, spam, fraud, theft, predation, and attacks on the network itself. As these undesirable phenomena proliferate, business, government, and many users find common cause for locking down Internet and PC architecture in the interests of security and order. PC and Internet security vulnerabilities are a legitimate menace. However, the most likely reactions - if they are not forestalled - will be at least as unfortunate as the security problems themselves. Consider the growing profusion of tethered appliances - devices whose functions cannot readily be altered by their owners (think TiVo). Such appliances take Internet innovations and wrap them up in a neat, easy-to-use package, which is good - but only if the Internet and PC can remain sufficiently in the center of the digital ecosystem to produce the next round of innovations and to generate competition. People buy these devices for their convenience or functionality and may appreciate the fact that they are safer to use (they limit the damage users can do through ignorance or carelessness). But the risk is that users, by migrating to such appliances, will unwittingly trade away the future benefits of generativity - a loss that will go unappreciated even as innovation tapers off.","Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England","Zittrain, J (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",z@oii.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,0,7,7,2,24,HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL PUBLISHING CORPORATION,WATERTOWN,"300 NORTH BEACON STREET, WATERTOWN, MA 02472 USA",0017-8012,,,HARVARD BUS REV,Harv.

Larvae of the California newt (Taricha torosa), for example, exhibit predator- avoidance behavior in response to a chemical from cannibalistic adults. The poison tetrodotoxin (TTX), well known as an adult chemical defense, stimulates larval escape to refuges. Although they are cannibals, adult newts feed preferentially on worms (Eisenia rosea) over conspecific young. Hence, larval avoidance reactions to TTX are suppressed in the presence of odor from these alternative prey. The free amino acid, arginine, is abundant in fluids emitted by injured worms. Here, we demonstrate that arginine is a natural suppressant of TTX-stimulated larval escape behavior. Compared to a tapwater control, larvae initiated vigorous swimming in response to 10(-7) mol l(-1) TTX. This excitatory response was eliminated when larval nasal cavities were blocked with an inert gel, but not when gel was placed on the forehead (control). In additional trials, a binary mixture of arginine and 10(-7) mol l(-1) TTX failed to induce larval swimming. The inhibitory effect of arginine was, however, dose dependent. An arginine concentration as low as 0.3-times that of TTX was significantly suppressant. Further analysis showed that suppression by arginine of TTX-stimulated behavior was eliminated by altering the positively-charged guanidinium moiety, but not by modifying the carbon chain, carboxyl group, or amine group. These results are best explained by a mechanism of competitive inhibition between arginine and TTX for common, olfactory receptor binding sites. Although arginine alone has no impact on larval behavior, it nevertheless signals active adult predation on alternative prey, and hence, reduced cannibalism risk.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Program Neurosci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Brain Res, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Zimmer, RK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",z@biology.ucla.edu,,,,,,88,26,27,0,22,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

The time budgets of focal geese were recorded, and the effects of flock size on the proportions of time spent in vigilant and agonistic behaviour were tested. The results showed that the decline in vigilance level and consequent increase in foraging time were beneficial results of flocking whereas agonistic interactions, a potential cost of flocking, did not increase with increasing flock size. However, seasonal variation in flock size suggested that exploitative competition could be a cost of flocking; the sizes of flocks in spring, when resource depletion had progressed, were significantly reduced compared with those in autumn. An experimental increase in rice density resulted in a significant increase in flock size. We conclude that the flock size of foraging white-fronted geese is a result of compromise between a constant benefit of flocking (i.e. decline in vigilance level) and a cost of flocking varying with food abundance (i.e. exploitative competition).","Univ Tokyo, Sch Agr & Life Sci, Lab Biodivers Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Amano, T (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Sch Agr & Life Sci, Lab Biodivers Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.",tatsu@es.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Amano, Tatsuya/E-7367-2010","Amano, Tatsuya/0000-0001-6576-3410",,,,27,15,17,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-8369,1469-7998,,J ZOOL,J.

At this interface, edge effects on forest habitats can include altered abiotic conditions, changes in rates of competition and predation, and altered community structure. While the edge effects resulting from clearcuts and other open habitats are well-studied, little is known about the comparative edge effects of forest roads. We studied the effects of forest roads on the abundance, surface activity, and body condition of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) and slimy salamanders (P. glutinosus and P. cylindraceus) in the Southern Appalachians of Virginia. We conducted surveys for salamanders at 21 sites where gravel roads bisected mature forest. These sites were divided into three data sets based on region and year of survey. We also carried out an enclosure experiment to determine whether road edges influenced the surface activity and detectability of red-backed salamanders. We found fewer red-backed salamanders near roads in all three data sets. These edge effects extended <20 m into the forest in two of the three data sets but increased linearly out to 80 m in the data set collected during an unusually dry period. In contrast, slimy salamanders showed no clear responses to forest-road edges and had significantly different responses than those of red-backed salamanders. Within our experimental enclosures, red-backed salamander detectability did not differ between edge and interior habitats, suggesting that the patterns we observed were not simply due to changes in salamander activity patterns. Like red-backed salamander counts, soil moisture and cover object area also tended to decrease near roads. The steepness of the gradient in soil moisture was a significant predictor of the steepness of the decline in salamander counts, while there was no significant relationship between the decreases in cover object area and decreases in salamander counts. Collectively, these results show that edge effects from forest roads may be comparable to edge effects from clear-cuts or other types of silvicultural edges. Additionally, they suggest that, for terrestrial salamanders, variation in the magnitude of edge effects may be related to variation in soil moisture. Management approaches that minimize soil desiccation associated with road building and maintenance may reduce the impacts of roads on amphibian populations in adjacent forest.","Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Biol, Lexington, VA 24450 USA","Marsh, DM (corresponding author), Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Biol, Lexington, VA 24450 USA.",marshd@wlu.edu,"Beckman, Noelle/E-5554-2011","Beckman, Noelle/0000-0001-5822-0610",,,,44,57,61,0,42,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

We conducted laboratory experiments to determine if biotic interactions account for this spatial distribution. In the first experiment, we measured the effect of Hexagenia (0, 256, 512, 768, 1,024 nymphs m(-2)) and Chironomus (5,120, 2,560, 1,280, 640, 0 larvae m(-2)) density on survivorship and increase in body length of newly-hatched and large Hexagenia nymphs. Results did not suggest competition for space. Since the outcome of competition may be influenced by order of establishment, we tested temporal overlap by adding Chironomus larvae to containers with Hexagenia nymphs at different stages in their development and vice versa (experiment 2). Newly-hatched mayflies showed the smallest increase in body length after being exposed to midges after 0 and 10 days, but exhibited no significant difference from the control after 20, 40, and 60 days of exposure to midges. In experiment 3, we tested if Hexagenia or Chironomus larvae ate mayfly eggs. Chironomus larvae significantly reduced the number of Hexagenia eggs at densities examined and we speculate that the reduction occurred because of egg consumption. In contrast, the number of eggs remaining in the presence of a Hexagenia nymph did not differ significantly from the control. We confirmed that midges were present in Lake Erie sediments when Hexagenia oviposit. These findings suggest that tube-dwelling Chironomus larvae may contribute to the inability of Hexagenia to become established in certain locations in western Lake Erie.","Univ Windsor, Dept Biol Sci, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada","Corkum, LD (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Dept Biol Sci, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",,"Ciborowski, Jan/AAC-8247-2019",,,,,39,2,2,0,1,INT ASSOC GREAT LAKES RES,ANN ARBOR,"2205 COMMONWEALTH BLVD, ANN ARBOR, MI 48105 USA",0380-1330,,,J GREAT LAKES RES,J.

Some of the decline in L. lugubris numbers could occur through the process of exploitative competition for food resources. Our experiments were designed to see if other variables were important in the decline. We found that L. lugubris were more likely to use a hiding platform in enclosures with 2 rather than I platform when conspecific or heterospecific pairs of geckos were housed in an enclosure. Additionally, when two H. frenatus were housed in the same enclosure, they maintained closer proximity to each other than when their cagemates were L. lugubris. L. lugubris developed and laid more eggs when housed with another L. lugubris than when housed with either a female or male H. frenatus. Most interestingly, L. lugubris housed in enclosures previously occupied by H. frenatus males required more time for egg development and laying than geckos housed in enclosures previously occupied by another L. lugubris. In conclusion, variables in addition to food competition may influence the declines in L. lugubris numbers when an area in which they are established is invaded by the bisexual gecko, H. frenatus. L. lugubris numbers may decline in response to their reluctance to share a hiding place with another gecko, leaving them more vulnerable to predators. Additionally, L. lugubris fecundity may be negatively affected by the exudates from H. frenatus femoral pores or the odors of their feces.","Univ Hawaii, Hilo, HI 96720 USA","Brown, SG (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Hilo, HI 96720 USA.",,,,,,,19,13,18,0,18,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,SEP,2002,139,,9,,,,1161,1173,,10.1163/15685390260437317,,,13,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,626AT,WOS:000179848800005,,,,,2021-09-27,

For phytoplankton, the controversy revolves around whether zooplankton grazers, especially large cladocerans like Daphnia, can effectively reduce phytoplankton populations regardless of nutrient conditions. For bacteria, little is known about the balance between possible direct and indirect effects of both nutrients and zooplankton grazing. However, there is evidence that bacteria may affect phytoplankton responses to nutrients or zooplankton grazing through direct or apparent competition. We performed a mesocosm experiment to evaluate the relative importance of the effects of nutrients and zooplankton grazing for phytoplankton and bacteria, and to determine whether bacteria mediate phytoplankton responses to these factors. The factorial design crossed two zooplankton treatments (unsieved and sieved) with four nutrient treatments (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mu g phosphorus (P) l(-1) day(-1), together with nitrogen (N) at a N:P ratio of 20:1 by weight). Weekly sieving with 300 pm mesh reduced the average size of crustacean zooplankton in the mesocosms, decreased the numbers and biomass of Daphnia, and increased the biomass of adult copepods. Nutrient enrichment caused significant increases in phytoplankton chlorophyll a (4-5x), bacterial abundance and production (1.3x and 1.6x, respectively), Daphnia (3x) and total zooplankton biomass (2x). Although both total phytoplankton chlorophyll a and chlorophyll a in the <35 mu m size fraction were significantly lower in unsieved mesocosms than in sieved mesocosms, sieving had no significant effect on bacterial abundance or production. There was no statistical interaction between nutrient and zooplankton treatments for total phytoplankton biomass or bacterial abundance, although there were marginally significant interactions for phytoplankton biomass <35 mu m and bacterial production. Our results do not support the hypothesis that large cladocerans become less effective grazers with enrichment; rather, the difference between phytoplankton biomass in sieved versus unsieved zooplankton treatments increased across the gradient of nutrient additions. Furthermore, there was no evidence that bacteria buffered phytoplankton responses to enrichment by either sequestering P or affecting the growth of zooplankton.","UNIV WISCONSIN, CTR LIMNOL, MADISON, WI 53706 USA; INST ECOSYST STUDIES, MILLBROOK, NY 12545 USA",,,"Cottingham, Kathryn/H-1593-2012; Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020; Cole, Jonathan J/G-4566-2011; Cottingham, Kathryn L./AAV-3934-2021","Cole, Jonathan J/0000-0003-4633-7402; Cottingham, Kathryn L./0000-0003-3169-5047; Pace, Michael/0000-0001-5945-6131",,,,55,37,38,2,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-7873,,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

Indirect evidence from previous research has suggested that ant foraging may significantly lower the abundance of arboreal spiders in young Douglas-fir plantations in western Oregon. This study tested the effect of foraging by ants, dominated by Camponotus spp., on spider assemblages in Douglas-fir canopies in a 5-month ant-exclusion experiment. The biomass of potential prey organisms on foliage, dominated by Psocoptera, increased significantly by 1.9- to 2.4-fold following ant exclusion. The removal of ants did not affect the abundance of flying arthropods in the vicinity of tree canopies as indicated by sticky trap catches. The abundance of hunting spiders, the majority being Salticidae, increased significantly by 1.5- to 1.8-fold in trees without ants in the late summer; neither the abundance of web-building spiders nor the average body size of hunting and web-building spiders were significantly affected by ant removal. Spider diversity and community structure did not differ significantly between control and ant-removal trees. The majority of prey captured by ants were aphidoidea (48.1%) and Psocoptera (12.5%); spiders represented only 1.4% of the ants' diet. About 40% of observed ants were tending Cinara spp. aphids. Our observations suggest that the lower abundance of hunting spiders in control canopies with ants may be due to interference competition with ants resulting from ant foraging and aphid-tending activities. Direct predation of spiders by ants appeared to be of minor importance in this study system. This study did not provide sufficient evidence for exploitative competition for prey between ants and spiders.","OREGON STATE UNIV,DEPT FOREST SCI,CORVALLIS,OR 97331","Halaj, J (corresponding author), OREGON STATE UNIV,DEPT ENTOMOL,CORDLEY HALL 2046,CORVALLIS,OR 97331, USA.",,,,,,,63,92,96,0,19,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,1997,109,2,,,,,313,322,,10.1007/s004420050089,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WE993,WOS:A1997WE99300018,28307185,,,,2021-09-27,

Experiments where tiles were ''pre-conditioned'' with snails grazing at several densities actually stimulated grazing in subsequently added snails, suggesting that substrate-borne cues are also not responsible for density-dependent reductions in grazing rate.

Little is known about effects of predators on either species and we compared the effects of a common native crayfish predator (Procambarus fallax) on hatchlings and juveniles. Because crayfish feed size-selectively, we predicted that the smaller P. maculata hatchlings would be more vulnerable than the hatchlings of native P. paludosa. In experimental wetland mesocosms, crayfish reduced survival of both species, but none of the P. maculata survived the 44 days exposure, such that predatory effects of crayfish were >8x stronger on the non-native P. maculata than on native P. paludosa. Crayfish in the lab selectively consumed the smaller P. maculata when offered both hatchlings simultaneously. We combined the observed survival rates with published life history data and the results (i.e., projected survivors clutch(-1)) suggested that wetlands with crayfish could have greater limiting effects on non-native P. maculata than the native P. paludosa.

However, the magnitude of impacts depends not only on the degree of warming but also on the number of species at risk, their physiological sensitivity to warming and their options for behavioural and physiological compensation. Lizards are useful for evaluating risks of warming because their thermal biology is well studied. We conducted macrophysiological analyses of diurnal lizards from diverse latitudes plus focal species analyses of Puerto Rican Anolis and Sphaerodactyus. Although tropical lowland lizards live in environments that are warm all year, macrophysiological analyses indicate that some tropical lineages (thermoconformers that live in forests) are active at low body temperature and are intolerant of warm temperatures. Focal species analyses show that some tropical forest lizards were already experiencing stressful body temperatures in summer when studied several decades ago. Simulations suggest that warming will not only further depress their physiological performance in summer, but will also enable warm-adapted, open-habitat competitors and predators to invade forests. Forest lizards are key components of tropical ecosystems, but appear vulnerable to the cascading physiological and ecological effects of climate warming, even though rates of tropical warming may be relatively low.","[Huey, Raymond B.; Tewksbury, Joshua J.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Deutsch, Curtis A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Vitt, Laurie J.] Univ Oklahoma, Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum Nat Hist, Norman, OK 73072 USA; [Vitt, Laurie J.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Zool, Norman, OK 73072 USA; [Hertz, Paul E.] Columbia Univ Barnard Coll, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Perez, Hector J.

Historical accounts detail how the arrival of foxes in many areas coincided with the local demise of native fauna. Recent analyses suggest that native fauna can be successfully reintroduced to their former ranges only if foxes have been controlled, and several replicated removal experiments have confirmed that foxes are the major agents of extirpation of native fauna. Predation is the primary cause of losses, but competition and transmission of disease may be important for some species. In agricultural landscapes, fox predation on lambs can cause losses of 1-30%; variation is due to flock size, health and management, as well as differences in the timing and duration of lambing and the density of foxes. Fox control measures include trapping, shooting, den fumigation and exclusion fencing; baiting using the toxin 1080 is the most commonly employed method. Depending on the baiting strategy, habitat and area covered, baiting can reduce fox activity by 50-97%. We review patterns of baiting in a large sheep-grazing region in central New South Wales, and propose guidelines to increase landholder awareness of baiting strategies, to concentrate and coordinate bait use, and to maximize the cost-effectiveness of baiting programs. The variable reduction in fox density within the baited area, together with the ability of the fox to recolonize rapidly, suggest that current baiting practices in eastern Australia are often ineffective, and that reforms are required. These might include increasing landholder awareness and involvement in group control programs, and the use of more efficient broadscale techniques, such as aerial baiting.","[Dickman, Christopher R.] Univ Sydney, Inst Wildlife Res, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Gentle, Matthew N.] Biosecur Queensland, Robert Wicks Pest Anim Res Ctr, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Saunders, Glen R.] Univ Canberra, Invas Anim Cooperat Res Ctr, Canberra, ACT 2617, Australia; [Saunders, Glen R.] Dept Primary Ind, Vertebrate Pest Res Unit, Orange, NSW 2800, Australia","Dickman, CR (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Inst Wildlife Res, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",glen.saunders@industry.nsw.gov.au; matthew.gentle@deedi.qld.gov.au; chris.dickman@sydney.edu.au,"Dickman, Christopher/Q-4662-2019; saunders, glen r/B-8356-2011","Dickman, Christopher/0000-0002-1067-3730; ",,,,239,135,139,4,154,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-1838,1365-2907,,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,JUL,2010,40,3,,,,,181,211,,10.1111/j.1365-2907.2010.00159.x,,,31,Ecology; Zoology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,608FF,WOS:000278567600001,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, the ingestion of fresh vegetables contaminated by snail mucus and/or water has also been proposed as a source of the infection for some zoonotic metastrongyloids (e.g., Angiostrongylus cantonensis). In the meantime, the feline lungworms Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Troglostrongylus brevior are increasingly spreading among cat populations, along with their gastropod intermediate hosts. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of alternative transmission pathways for A. abstrusus and T. brevior L3 via the mucus of infected Helix aspersa snails and the water where gastropods died. In addition, the histological examination of snail specimens provided information on the larval localization and inflammatory reactions in the intermediate host. Methodology/Principal Findings Twenty-four specimens of H. aspersa received similar to 500 L1 of A. abstrusus and T. brevior, and were assigned to six study groups. Snails were subjected to different mechanical and chemical stimuli throughout 20 days in order to elicit the production of mucus. At the end of the study, gastropods were submerged in tap water and the sediment was observed for lungworm larvae for three consecutive days. Finally, snails were artificially digested and recovered larvae were counted and morphologically and molecularly identified. The anatomical localization of A. abstrusus and T. brevior larvae within snail tissues was investigated by histology. L3 were detected in the snail mucus (i. e., 37 A. abstrusus and 19 T. brevior) and in the sediment of submerged specimens (172 A. abstrusus and 39 T. brevior). Following the artificial digestion of H. aspersa snails, a mean number of 127.8 A. abstrusus and 60.3 T. brevior larvae were recovered. The number of snail sections positive for A. abstrusus was higher than those for T. brevior. Conclusions Results of this study indicate that A. abstrusus and T. brevior infective L3 are shed in the mucus of H. aspersa or in water where infected gastropods had died submerged. Both elimination pathways may represent alternative route(s) of environmental contamination and source of the infection for these nematodes under field conditions and may significantly affect the epidemiology of feline lungworms. Considering that snails may act as intermediate hosts for other metastrongyloid species, the environmental contamination by mucus-released larvae is discussed in a broader context.","[Giannelli, Alessio; Colella, Vito; Ramos, Rafael Antonio do Nascimento; Dantas-Torres, Filipe; Otranto, Domenico] Univ Bari, Dept Vet Med, Bari, Italy; [Abramo, Francesca] Univ Pisa, Dept Vet Sci, Pisa, Italy; [Falsone, Luigi; Brianti, Emanuele] Univ Messina, Dept Vet Sci, Messina, Italy; [Varcasia, Antonio] Univ Sassari, Dept Vet Med, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Dantas-Torres, Filipe] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Aggeu Magalhaes Res Inst, Dept Immunol, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Knaus, Martin] Merial GmbH, Kathrinenhof Res Ctr, Rohrdorf, Germany; [Fox, Mark T.] Univ London, Royal Vet Coll, Dept Pathol & Pathogen Biol, London, England","Giannelli, A (corresponding author), Univ Bari, Dept Vet Med, Bari, Italy.",domenico.otranto@uniba.it,"Otranto, Domenico/Y-3249-2019; Dantas-Torres, Filipe/AAC-5982-2020; Colella, Vito/AAR-5514-2021; Dantas-Torres, Filipe/G-1617-2012; Varcasia, Antonio/B-7939-2013; Colella, Vito/A-7661-2016","Dantas-Torres, Filipe/0000-0002-1496-6274; Colella, Vito/0000-0002-4903-1479; Varcasia, Antonio/0000-0001-6306-9978; Colella, Vito/0000-0002-4903-1479; Fox, Mark/0000-0003-2545-4036; Otranto, Domenico/0000-0002-7518-476X; Knaus, Martin/0000-0003-3130-6064; Giannelli, Alessio/0000-0001-5855-2906",,,,40,38,39,0,16,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Therefore, even euryecious invasive species may exhibit clear substratum preferences, contributing to their success in novel areas. We used 24-h pairwise-choice experiments to study substratum preferences of the highly invasive freshwater Ponto-Caspian gammarid Dikerogammarus villosus (Amphipoda, Crustacea). We tested its preferences for stony substrata of various grain diameters (2-124mm), macrophytes differing in structural complexity (Myriophyllum spicatum, Ceratophyllum demersum, Potamogeton perfoliatus, Potamogeton nodosus, Stuckenia pectinata) and zebra mussels. We hypothesized that: (1) gammarids would select substrata adjusted to their body size and offering maximum protection; (2) mussels would be the most preferred substratum except in high densities, which lead to deterioration of water quality; (3) large gammarids would displace smaller conspecifics to worse substratum. Our results showed that large (>9mm) and small (<7mm) gammarids preferred stones >6cm and between 6 and 8cm, respectively, with relatively large empty spaces among particles (4-9cm). Small gammarids selected complex plants, particularly M.spicatum, whereas large individuals also preferred less complex forms with large leaves (Pot.nodosus, Pot.perfoliatus). Small gammarids exhibited higher affinity for natural macrophytes than large individuals. All gammarids preferred stones over plants. Contrary to most of the published data, gammarids selected stones more often than dense zebra mussel colonies and did not discriminate between low density mussel and stone habitats. Oxygen depletion seems to be the factor distracting gammarids from mussel habitats. Thus, they seem to select mussel colonies only when alternative hard substrata are missing. Differences in substratum preferences between size classes were not pronounced, but small individuals switched to the less preferred habitat in the presence of adults, probably avoiding cannibalism and competition.","[Kobak, J.; Jermacz, L.; Dzierzynska-Bialonczyk, A.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland","Kobak, J (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Biol & Environm Protect, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",jkob73@umk.pl,"Kobak, Jaroslaw/F-2796-2013; Jermacz, Lukasz/B-8728-2017","Kobak, Jaroslaw/0000-0001-7660-9240; Jermacz, Lukasz/0000-0001-9182-116X","National Science CentreNational Science Centre, Poland [2012/05/B/NZ8/00479]",Our study was supported by a grant from the National Science Centre 2012/05/B/NZ8/00479.

While adaptations to the use of small carcasses are well known for Nicrophorus (emitting sex pheromone, burying, rounding and removing hair from carcasses, regulating brood size, regurgitating to young, and preventing predation), there is little information regarding its sister group, Ptomascopus. Like Nicrophorus, Ptomascopus morio males emit pheromone to attract females. In the absence of carrion competitors Ptomascopus morio parents were found to stay with a carcass and their brood for up to 10 days. We tested six hypotheses to examine whether young benefit from this long period of parent-offspring contact. (1) There was no evidence that parents buried or otherwise pre-empted carcasses to reduce competitive pressure. (2) We found no evidence that parents influenced the decomposition of the carcass. This was supported by experimental manipulations in which brood production (number of larvae and total brood mass) was no greater on carcasses on which parents were present than on carcasses not 'prepared' by parents. In addition, the carcass was not rounded and little hair was removed by the adults. (3) The presence of parents benefited the brood by reducing the negative effects of competition with carrion fly larvae. This likely resulted from predatory feeding by adult beetles. (4) Females adjusted clutch size to the size of the carcass. Parents, however, did not make a second adjustment in brood size after young reached the larval stage (filial cannibalism), as occurs in Nicrophorus. (5) Although parents were observed to open feeding holes in the carcass, this was not necessary for normal larval growth and survival. Parents were not observed to feed young directly by regurgitation. (6) Lastly, parents did not reduce predation on their brood when a conspecific intruder was present. These findings suggest that after the female parent adjusts clutch size to the size of the resource, the only parental benefit is clearing the carcass of fly larvae. Other differences with Nicrophorus include an extended period of oviposition (5 days) and less pronounced changes in ovarian mass and juvenile hormone titers in response to discovery of a carcass. In a field experiment in Kyoto, Japan, 17 of 21 broods of N. concolor during August contained larvae of P. morio. Mixed Nicrophorus Ptomascopus broods were less common at other times of the year and when N. quadripunctatus occupied carcasses. In the laboratory, P. morio was able to parasitize 19 of 20 broods of N. concolor. The pattern of oviposition, the absence of explicit parental behaviours, and the interactions with N. concolor in the field suggest that Ptomascopus morio is a brood parasite of Nicrophorus.","Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, Shiga, Japan","Trumbo, ST (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 75 N Eagleville Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",trumbo@uconn.edu,,"Trumbo, Stephen/0000-0002-4455-4211",,,,72,29,32,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-8369,1469-7998,,J ZOOL,J.

Therefore, hosts must defend themselves against intestinal parasites by mounting an immune response. Many penguin species acquire parasites through their diet and transfer these parasites to their chicks when feeding them. High parasite loads in penguin chicks could have effects on their growth and body condition, and ultimately on their survival. Here, we evaluated the effect of parasites on the cell-mediated immune system in Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) chicks at Stranger Point (25 de Mayo/King George Island, South Shetland Islands). To this end, 12 chicks were experimentally deparasitized with a mixture of anthelminthic drugs (albendazole and praziquantel), whereas 10 others were kept as control. We measured cutaneous cell-mediated immunity in response to immunization with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). We also analyzed the leukocyte profile in both treated and control groups before and after the treatment. After the treatment, deparasitized birds showed larger foot-web swelling in response to PHA injection than control birds. Deparasitized penguins also showed lower eosinophil and monocyte counts than controls, whereas heterophils, lymphocytes, and total white blood cell counts did not differ between groups. Our results suggest that Gentoo penguin chicks parasitized with intestinal parasites suffer a cost in terms of reduced cell-mediated immune responses that could ultimately affect their survival.","[Bertellotti, Marcelo; D'Amico, Veronica L.; Gabriela Palacios, Maria] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Nacl Patagon, Ecophysiol Appl Management & Conservat Wildlife, Brown 2915, RA-9120 Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina; [Barbosa, Andres] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Madrid, Spain; [Coria, Nestor] Inst Antartico Argentino, Dept Biol Top Predators, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Bertellotti, M (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Nacl Patagon, Ecophysiol Appl Management & Conservat Wildlife, Brown 2915, RA-9120 Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina.",bertello@cenpat-conicet.gob.ar,"Barbosa, Andres/C-3208-2008","Barbosa, Andres/0000-0001-8434-3649",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CTM2011-24427],"We very much appreciate the hospitality and logistic support of the Argentinean Antarctic Base Carlini (ex Jubany).

Seed dispersal is a key process that determines the spatial structure and dynamics of populations of plants, establishes the potential area of recruitment and in this way, the basis for subsequent processes such as predation, germination, competition and growth. The purpose of this research was to identify the guild of frugivores of the Oenocapus bataua palm in fragments of Andean forest, determine the effective dispersers and relate the spatial distribution of palm populations with the dispersion of seeds. To this end, between August 2005-June 2006, observations of the removal of fruits from eight clusters were done, and counting of consumption of fruits beneath 78 palms with mature fruits was undertaken; focal observations of 13 individuals during 90 hours; registration of frugivory with photographic traps during 165 days/nights for a total of 195 photographs and 144 consumption events; experiments with dispersion using 751 perforated fruits/seeds attached to strings and finally, plots to determine spatial distribution all were carried out. In the study area at least five species of mammals ate, dispersed, buried (Sciurus granatensis, Microsciurus mimulus, Dasyprocta punctata y Proechimys sp.), cover (Marmosa robinsoni) and carried the fruits of O. bataua off to caves (Marmosa robinsoni y Proechimys sp.) without damaging the seed. A 21.7% of the fruits were dispersed, 13.2 gnawed or peeled, 5.6% covered, buried and carried to caves. The average distance of removal of seeds and fruits was 3.1m although in a lesser proportion, dispersion events of >50m were recorded. The abundant production of fruits, their size and weight, their intense removal by frugivores, the short dispersion distances, the absence of large size frugivores (reduced by hunting and fragmentation), that might perform long-distance dispersion, and the increase of rodents, especially squirrels, that strongly pressure the fruit resource, generate a spatially restricted seed rain of seeds responsible for the aggregate patterns of distribution of seeds, seedlings and subsequently of juveniles and sub-adults. However the short time and high percentage of seed germination and the robustness of seeds and seedlings give O. bataua the capacity to survive in dense aggregations. Therefore, despite the limitations on dispersion, this is a dominant species in the study area. Populations of O. bataua have been reduced by intense exploitation and by the transformation and reduction of their natural habitat. The over-exploitation of the fruits or the juvenile phases of this palm can affect the age structure and population dynamics. Therefore, the management and exploitation of this palm in the future will depend to large degree on the conservation of forest habitats. Rev. Biol. Trop. 60 (4): 1445-1461.

The distribution of a population of oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus L., that varied temporally in size, over beds of mussels Mytilus edulis L., that varied spatially in quality, was investigated. It was expected that, as bird numbers on the estuary increased causing competition for preferred beds to intensify and the birds to spread out over their food gradient, the characteristics of the mussel beds with which bird densities were correlated would change. 2. Bird numbers on each bed, and thus their densities, were censused approximately monthly. The mussel bed characteristics considered likely to correlate with bird density were: mussels (densities of several length-classes and shell thickness on the dorsal and ventral sides) and beds (area, flatness, exposure time, proportion covered by algae, softness of the substrate and distance from the birds' high water roost). 3. An initial multiple regression analysis relating bird density to these bed characteristics, using data collected from 21-23 beds during the first 3 years, enabled three variables to be eliminated from further consideration: exposure time, algal cover and flatness. A subsequent similar analysis of data from the 12 'priority' beds, studied over 8 years, allowed more variables to be eliminated: the densities of small and large mussels, shell thickness on the ventral side, and bed size. The four remaining variables - substrate softness, distance to roost, density of mussels 40-50 mm long and shell thickness on the dorsal side - together accounted for most of the explainable variation in bird density between the 12 priority beds. 4. Multiple regressions of the logarithms of bird density against these four variables were then calculated separately for each of the 83 censuses. The standardized partial regression coefficients were plotted against total population size. In the presence of the other three variables, the effect of the density of 40-50 mm mussels was small at low population sizes but increased as bird numbers rose; at high population sizes, bird densities were higher where mussels were dense. At low population sizes, bird densities increased with shell thickness whereas, at high population sizes, they decreased with shell thickness. Bird densities were generally higher on beds far from the roost, particularly at the higher population sizes. The effect of substrate softness remained consistently large at all population sizes, and may even have increased; bird densities were markedly higher on beds with firm substrates on all except a few low population censuses. 5. The causal basis of these changes are discussed in relation to ideal free distribution models that assume that predators feed where their energy intake rate is maximized. Although the variables that defined the food gradient in this field study were largely different to those used in such models, the conceptual framework these models provide is nonetheless a useful way of viewing how the distribution of oystercathers over their food gradient changes with population size.",,"GOSSCUSTARD, JD (corresponding author), INST TERR ECOL, FURZEBROOK RES STN, WAREHAM BH20 5AS, DORSET, ENGLAND.",,"Clarke, Ralph T/B-3859-2009",,,,,45,33,33,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Because egg mortality in abscised flowers is 100%, yucca moths should avoid ovipositing in, or decrease the number of eggs laid in, flowers more likely to abscise. The focus of our study was to demonstrate experimentally (1) the extent to which abscission is non-random with respect to the number and kinds yucca moth ovipositions, and (2) the extent to which yucca moths modify their oviposition behavior in response to the probable fate of a flower as determined by the number and kinds of previous ovipositions in a flower. To address these problems we studied the interaction between Yucca kanabensis and its two species of pollinating yucca moths, one each from the deep and shallow groups in the Tegeticula yuccasella species complex. We demonstrate that the presence of deep ovipositions increased abscission rates of flowers with shallow ovipositions, the presence of shallow ovipositions had no effect on abscission of flowers with deep ovipositions, and the probability of abscission increased with the number of deep ovipositions but was independent of the number of shallow ovipositions. These results indicate that regulation of mutualism through selective abscission of fruit works for deeps but not for shallows. We predicted that yucca moths should avoid flowers with deep ovipositions and seek out flowers with shallow ovipositions.

Similar declines were noted in Sonora, Mexico; however, the species still persists at many sites in Mexico. Chytridiomycosis was detected during some declines and implicated in others; however, airborne pollutants from copper smelters, predation, competition, and extreme weather may have also been contributing factors. We collected Tarahumara Frogs in Sonora for captive rearing and propagation beginning in 1999, and released frogs to two historical localities in Arizona, including Big Casa Blanca Canyon and vicinity, Santa Rita Mountains, and Sycamore Canyon, Atascosa Mountains. Releases in the Big Casa Blanca Canyon area began in 2004 and frogs prospered and reproduced there initially but were much reduced in numbers by late 2007 after post-fire flooding and sedimentation of breeding pools and chytridiomycosis die-offs. We released additional frogs during 2012-2015, and small numbers of Tarahumara Frogs have continued to persist at this site and an adjacent drainage through 2019. At Sycamore Canyon, we began releases of Tarahumara Frog in 2014, and small numbers have persisted into 2019 in a tributary canyon. We also established a population in 2002 at Kofa National Wildlife Refuge in western Arizona as a refugium and source of animals for reintroduction. As of 2019, it still persists as a robust breeding population. We discuss our methods for reintroducing Tarahumara Frogs, problems, adaptive management, and future options for reintroduction of this species into Arizona.","[Rorabaugh, James C.] POB 31, St David, AZ 85630 USA; [Owens, Audrey K.; Sredl, Michael J.] Arizona Game & Fish Dept, 5000 West Carefree Highway, Phoenix, AZ 85086 USA; [King, Abigail] Jack Creek Preserve Fdn, POB 3, Ennis, MT 59716 USA; [Hale, Stephen F.] EcoPlan Associates Inc, 3610 North Prince Village Pl,Suite 140, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [Poulin, Stephane] Arizona Sonora Desert Museum, 2021 North Kinney Rd, Tucson, AZ 85743 USA; [Lemos-Espinal, Julio A.] Fac Estudios Super Iztacala, Unidad Biotecnol & Prototipos, Lab Ecol, Ave Barrios 1, Tlalnepantla 54090, Estado De Mexic, Mexico","Rorabaugh, JC (corresponding author), POB 31, St David, AZ 85630 USA.",jrorabaugh@hotmail.com,,,"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Border XX1 program; Direccion General de Asuntos del Personal Academico - Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (DGAPA PAPIIT) [IN215418]","The following people assisted us in the field: Christina Akins, Dennis Caldwell, Catherine Crawford, George Ferguson, Kimberly Field, Robert Fink, Jose Salvador Gomez Melo, Susanna Henry, Holly Hicks, Craig Ivanyi, Rosa Elena Jimenez Maldonado, Jose Manuel Munguia, Jan Perry, Lin Piest, Suzanne Goforth, Philip Rosen, Cixto Saucedo, Tim Tibbitts, Ross Timmons, Andres Villareal, Christa Weise, Brian Wooldridge, and members of the Grand Canyon Chapter of the Sierra Club.

While predation may influence infaunal abundance patterns, other processes such as bioturbation may also be important by reducing infaunal abundances directly, or through an interaction with predation. In this study, the potential influence of bioturbation on an infaunal community is assessed in the sand habitat adjacent to an offshore hardbottom reef in southern Onslow Bay off the coast of North Carolina. Transect sampling at five distances away from the reef indicated that holothurian, Holothuria princeps, density is inversely correlated with infaunal densities. Laboratory experiments and field measurements of bioturbation rates suggest that H. princeps is the dominant bioturbator in the system, capable of completely turning over sediment immediately adjacent to the reef in as little as 6 d. Caging studies indicate that bioturbation does not differentially affect infaunal guilds based on mobility mode, but has an overall negative effect on gastropod and amphipod abundance, and infaunal rank abundances. This study suggests that bioturbation is of sufficient magnitude to influence infaunal abundances close to the reef, and may work concurrently with predation to produce observed infaunal abundance patterns.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA; Univ N Carolina, Natl Undersea Res Ctr, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA","Dahlgren, CP (corresponding author), Ctr Marine Conservat, 1725 DeSales St,NW 600, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",cdahlgren@dccmc.org,,,,,,40,21,22,2,14,ROSENSTIEL SCH MAR ATMOS SCI,MIAMI,"4600 RICKENBACKER CAUSEWAY, MIAMI, FL 33149 USA",0007-4977,1553-6955,,B MAR SCI,Bull.

However, the question whether the competition takes the form of interference or exploitative in driving diet specialization has never been investigated. We investigated individual diet specialization in the isopod Saduria entomon, in relation to forager and resource biomasses in a system that exhibits predator-prey fluctuations in density. We found that individual diet specialization was only affected by the biomass of their preferred prey (Monoporeia affinis) and not by Saduria biomass; diet specialization was higher when Monoporeia biomass was low compared to when there were high Monoporeia biomass. Population diet breadth increased at low Monoporeia biomass whereas individual diet breadths were marginally affected by Monoporeia biomass. Overall, this led to the increase in diet specialization at low Monoporeia biomass. This study shows that predator-prey dynamics might influence diet specialization in the predator and that resource biomass, not forager biomass might be important for individual diet specialization.","[Svanback, Richard] Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Evolut Limnol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Rydberg, Cecilia; Englund, Goran] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden; [Leonardsson, Kjell] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Svanback, R (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Evolut Limnol, Uppsala, Sweden.",richard.svanback@ebc.uu.se,,"Englund, Goran/0000-0001-5634-8602",Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Swedish Council for Forestry and Agricultural ResearchSwedish Research Council Formas; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission,"We thank Dan Bolnick, Peter Eklov, Philipp Hirsch and Burt P.

Regulation thus requires density-dependent negative feedback whereby the population has a propensity to increase when small and decrease when large. Ultimately, extinction occurs due to regulating mechanisms becoming weaker than various disruptive events and stochastic variation. Population regulation is one of the foundational concepts of ecology, yet this paradigm has often been challenged, during the first half of the 20th century when the concept was not clearly defined, and more recently by some who study demographically open populations. The history of ecology reveals that earlier manifestations of the concept focused mostly on competition as the mechanism of population regulation. Because competition is often not evident in nature, it was sometimes concluded that population regulation was therefore also absent. However, predation in the broadest sense can also cause density dependence. By the 1950s, the idea that demographic density dependence was essential (but not sufficient) for population regulation was well established, and since then, challenges to the general concept have been short lived. However, some now believe that metapopulations composed of demographically open local populations can persist without density dependence. In particular, some recent manifestations of the Recruitment Limitation Hypothesis all but preclude-the possibility of regulation. The theory of locally open populations indicates that persistence always relies on direct demographic density dependence at some spatial and temporal scale, even in models reportedly demonstrating the contrary. There is also increasing empirical evidence, especially in marine systems where competition for space is not self evident, that local density dependence is more pervasive than,previously assumed and is often caused by predation. However, there are currently insufficient data to test unequivocally whether or not any persistent metapopulation is regulated. The challenge for more complete understanding of regulation of metapopulations lies in combined empirical and theoretical studies that bridge the gap between smaller scale field experiments and larger scale phenomena that can presently be explored solely by theory.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Hixon, MA (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,,,,,209,281,285,5,168,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUN,2002,83,6,,,,,1490,1508,,10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[1490:PRHCAC]2.0.CO;2,,,19,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,565ZQ,WOS:000176400800003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Haematococcus, although showing a wide biogeographical distribution, has been rarely found in phytoplankton communities. Simultaneously, the colonization potential of air-dispersed Haematococcus in ephemeral waters and its interactions with coexisting phytoplankton taxa were examined by microscopy and molecular methods. Haematococcus was a successful colonist, appearing among the first taxa in the experimental containers. According to principal component analysis, Haematococcus growth rate was negatively correlated with the abundance and species richness of the other autotrophs. Furthermore, a negative correlation between Haematococcus and Chlamydomonas and a positive one between Haematococcus and Chlorella were found. Overall, Haematococcus appears to be an effective air-dispersed alga that can successfully colonize and establish populations in small ephemeral water bodies. However, its absence from phytoplankton in larger permanent water bodies could be related to its high light requirements, its competitive disadvantages against other algae, and the grazing pressures from predators. The results of our study suggest a life strategy based on adaptation to higher light intensities in very shallow waters compared with optical dense lakes. Therefore, ephemeral waters are the regular habitat for Haematococcus instead of being stepping stones for the colonization of lake phytoplankton.","[Genitsaris, Savvas] Univ Littoral Cote dOpale, LOG, Wimereux, France; [Stefanidou, Natassa; Katsiapi, Matina; Moustaka-Gouni, Maria] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Bot, Sch Biol, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece; [Vardaka, Elisabeth] Alexander Technol Educ Inst Thessaloniki, Dept Nutr & Dietet, Sindos, Greece; [Kormas, Konstantinos Ar.] Univ Thessaly, Sch Agr Sci, Dept Ichthyol & Aquat Environm, Nea Ionia, Greece; [Sommer, Ulrich] Geomar Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany","Genitsaris, S (corresponding author), Univ Littoral Cote dOpale, LOG, Wimereux, France.",savvas.genitsaris@yahoo.gr,"VARDAKA, Elisabeth/ABD-1341-2020; Kormas, Konstantinos/V-9336-2017; Genitsaris, Savvas/L-5302-2019","Kormas, Konstantinos/0000-0002-8214-0175; Genitsaris, Savvas/0000-0003-0585-2571; Moustaka-Gouni, Maria/0000-0002-0845-1928; Vardaka, Elisabeth/0000-0002-3698-9135",European Union (European Social Fund-ESF)European Social Fund (ESF); Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Program: Thales [MIS 377304],"This study was cofinanced by European Union (European Social Fund-ESF) and Greek national funds through the Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Program: Thales, with project code/title: MIS 377304/ Bioactivity of airborne particulates in relation with their size, morphology and chemical composition.",,40,3,3,1,13,TUBITAK SCIENTIFIC & TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL TURKEY,ANKARA,"ATATURK BULVARI NO 221, KAVAKLIDERE, ANKARA, 00000, TURKEY",1300-008X,1303-6106,,TURK J BOT,Turk.

In citrus agroecosystems, ants are considered a secondary pest. The damage they cause is indirect through the disruption of the biological control of pests, especially honeydew producers. In integrated pest management programs, adequate and precise sampling methods are required to accurately determine the need for chemical ant control to minimize the economic and environmental costs of unnecessary chemical treatments and to reduce the risk of crop loss by pests. In Mediterranean citrus groves, eight ant species that differed in abundance and frequency have been found foraging on citrus trees: Lasius grandis Forel, Pheidole pallidula (Nylander), Plagiolepis pygmaea (Latreille), Formica gerardi Bondroit, Formica rufibarbis Fabricius, Camponotus sylvaticus (Olivier), Linepithema humile (Mayr), and Tapinoma erraticum (Latreille) (all Hymenoptera: Formicidae). The trunk was selected as the most efficient sampling unit to establish the monitoring method. Aggregation indices on the trunk of these species were calculated, and enumerative and binomial sampling methods were developed for the most frequent species, L.grandis and Ph.pallidula. Ant species differed in spatial distributions within citrus orchards, and required different sample sizes to estimate population abundance. The minimum sample size required, taking into account the maximum average abundance found - 44.1 L.humile, 17.3 L.grandis, and 3.5 Ph.pallidula per trunk per min -, would be 28, 25, and 54 trees, respectively.","[Teresa Martinez-Ferrer, Maria; Miguel Campos-Rivela, Jose] IRTA Amposta, Carretera Balada,Km1, Amposta 43870, Tarragona, Spain","Martinez-Ferrer, MT (corresponding author), IRTA Amposta, Carretera Balada,Km1, Amposta 43870, Tarragona, Spain.",teresa.martinez@irta.cat,"Campos-Rivela, Jose Miguel/K-1128-2017; Martinez Ferrer, Maria Teresa/S-3219-2017","Campos-Rivela, Jose Miguel/0000-0001-7112-7699; Martinez Ferrer, Maria Teresa/0000-0002-0372-6486",National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA) from Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [RTA 2010-00012-C02-00 2011-2014],The authors thank Marcal Pla for his valuable assistance with surveys.

These chromosomes can in theory spread rapidly in populations and cause extinction, but many are found as balanced polymorphisms or as cryptic X(D)s shut down by drive suppressors. The relative likelihood of these outcomes and the evolutionary pathways through which they come about are not well understood. An X-D was recently discovered in the mycophagous fly, Drosophila testacea, presenting the opportunity to compare this X-D with the well-studied X-D of its sister species, Drosophila neotestacea. Comparing features of independently evolved X(D)s in young sister species is a promising avenue towards understanding how X(D)s and their counteracting forces change over time. In contrast to the X-D of D. neotestacea, we find that the X-D of D. testacea is old, with its origin predating the radiation of three species: D. testacea, D. neotestacea and their shared sister species, Drosophila orientacea. Motivated by the suggestion that older X(D)s should be more deleterious to carriers, we assessed the effect of the X-D on both male and female fertility. Unlike what is known from D. neotestacea, we found a strong fitness cost in females homozygous for the X-D in D. testacea: a large proportion of homozygous females failed to produce offspring after being housed with males for several days. Our male fertility experiments show that although X-D male fertility is lower under sperm-depleting conditions, X-D males have comparable fertility to males carrying a standard X chromosome under a free-mating regime, which may better approximate conditions in wild populations of D. testacea. Lastly, we demonstrate the presence of autosomal suppression of X chromosome drive. Our results provide support for a model of X-D evolution where the dynamics of young X(D)s are governed by fitness consequences in males, whereas in older X-D systems, both suppression and fitness consequences in females likely supersede male fitness costs.","[Keais, Graeme L.; Lu, Sijia; Perlman, Steve J.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, 3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada; [Keais, Graeme L.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Keais, GL; Perlman, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, 3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada.",graeme.keais@gmail.com; stevep@uvic.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,,45,3,3,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1010-061X,1420-9101,,J EVOLUTION BIOL,J.

Adult lizards (n = 14 males and 16 females) were marked by toe clipping in November 2001. They were observed at intervals (n = 10 times) over the next 18 months encompassing post-breeding (December-early March), recrudescence (late March-April) and breeding (May-August) phases. In the post-breeding phase, males perched at lower heights. They began perching higher during the recrudescence phase with the highest perches in the breeding phase. In comparison to females, the males perched higher than females all year round and showed greater among-individual variations in perch height. The bigger males perched at greater heights compared to smaller ones during recrudescence and breeding phases. No such trend was evident during the post-breeding phase and perch height was not related to body size. Females moved within a narrow range of heights from the substrata and showed no size-specific relationship in perch selection throughout the reproductive cycle. Selection of higher perches by the males, despite high predation risk, possibly helps in territory defence, courtship displays and in advertising their presence to conspecifics. Further, size-specific perch selection prior to and during the breeding period, suggests that size vis-A-vis age and reproductive cycle also influences selection of perch height in males. In females perching close to the substrata, refuge sites and food sources, seems to be associated with escape from predators, foraging benefits and, in turn, reproductive fitness. Thus, in the seasonally breeding P. dorsalis, sex and reproductive status determine the complex pattern of perching behaviour and, possibly, circulating levels of androgens drive the bigger boys on top in accordance with their size or age.","Karnatak Univ, Dept Zool, Dharwad 580003, Karnataka, India","Radder, RS (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Bldg A 08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",raju@mail.usyd.edu.au,,,,,,32,9,10,1,12,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1570-7555,1570-7563,,ANIM BIOL,Anim.

Freshwater pond snails (Planorbis planorbis), marine intertidal crabs (Hemigrapsus nudus) and microscopic soil nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) were placed in experimental arenas free of competitors and containing food patches of varying shapes and density distributions, and allowed to move and forage freely. Their movements were recorded at 1-minute Intervals, and any visible tracks and trails were photographed Pathways were digitally reconstructed using the recorded movement data, and along with the photographs were digitally analyzed The total path length, path tortuosity, polygon area, step number, average step length and average turning radius within the resource patches were compared to the values for movement outside the resource patches All three invertebrates engaged in area-restricted searching when within patches, consisting of a larger step number, higher path tortuosity, larger polygon area, greater turning radius, and a shorter step length.

Both ecological prediction and natural resource management rely on understanding the mechanisms that trigger such shifts and maintain each state. Differentiating between potential mechanisms is difficult, however, because shifts are often recognized only in hindsight and many occur on such large spatial scales that manipulative experiments to test their causes are difficult or impossible. Here we use an approach that focuses first on identifying changes in environmental factors that could have triggered a given state change, and second on examining whether these changes were sustained (and thus potentially maintained the new state) or transitory (explaining the shift but not its persistence). We use this approach to evaluate a community shift in which a benthic marine species of filter feeding sea cucumber (Pachythyone rubra) suddenly came to dominate subtidal rocky reefs that had previously supported high abundances of macroalgae, persisted for more than a decade, then abruptly declined. We found that a sustained period without large wave events coincided with the shift to sea cucumber dominance, but that the sea cucumbers persisted even after the end of this low wave period, indicating that different mechanisms maintained the new community. Additionally, the period of sea cucumber dominance occurred when their predators were rare, and increases in the abundance of these predators coincided with the end of sea cucumber dominance. These results underscore the complex nature of regime shifts and illustrate that focusing separately on the causes and maintenance of state change can be a productive first step for analyzing these shifts in a range of systems.","[Rassweiler, Andrew; Schmitt, Russell J.; Holbrook, Sally J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Rassweiler, Andrew; Schmitt, Russell J.; Holbrook, Sally J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Rassweiler, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",rassweil@lifesci.ucsb.edu,,"Rassweiler, Andrew/0000-0002-8760-3888","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 9982105, OCE 0620276]","We thank K.

By altering the interactions within a community, eco-evolutionary feedbacks may play a role in community stability. Indeed, recent empirical and theoretical studies demonstrate that these feedbacks can stabilize or destabilize communities and, moreover, that this sometimes depends on the relative rate of ecological to evolutionary processes. So far, theory on how eco-evolutionary feedbacks impact stability exists only for a few special cases. In our work, we develop a general theory for determining the effects of eco-evolutionary feedbacks on stability in communities with an arbitrary number of interacting species and evolving traits for when evolution is slow and fast. We characterize how eco-evolutionary feedbacks lead to stable communities that would otherwise be unstable, and vice versa. Additionally, we showhow one can identify the roles of direct and indirect feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes on stability and how the effects of those feedbacks depend on the rate of evolution relative to the ecological timescales. Applying our methods to models of competing species and food chains, we demonstrate how the functional form of trade-offs, genetic correlations between traits, and the rate of evolution determine whether eco-evolutionary feedbacks stabilize or destabilize communities.","[Patel, Swati] Univ Calif Davis, Grad Grp Appl Math, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Patel, Swati] Univ Vienna, Fac Math, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Patel, Swati] Tulane Univ, Dept Math, New Orleans, LA 70115 USA; [Cortez, Michael H.] Utah State Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Schreiber, Sebastian J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Schreiber, Sebastian J.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Patel, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Grad Grp Appl Math, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Patel, S (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Fac Math, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.; Patel, S (corresponding author), Tulane Univ, Dept Math, New Orleans, LA 70115 USA.",swpatel@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,68,14,14,0,21,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

However, detailed information is still scarce for Niviventer confucianus and Apodemus draco in the Hengduan Mountains on their habitat requirements. Data on habitats utilized by sympatric N. confucianus and A. draco were collected using transect line sampling from April to December 2008 in Fengtongzhai Nature Reserve, China. The results indicated that both mammals exhibited an obvious habitat preference across seasons. In spring, N. confucianus preferred habitats at lower elevations, with thicker leaf litter, lower bamboo cover, shorter total length of fallen logs and higher tree diversity, and A. draco preferred habitats at lower elevations and with higher percentage of nut trees. In summer-autumn, N. confucianus frequently occurred at sites with lower elevations and thicker leaf litter, while A. dram preferred habitats with thicker leaf litter and higher percentage of nut trees. In winter, N. confucianus preferred sites with lower elevations and dead tree density, and higher canopy and percentage of nut trees. In contrast, A. draco preferred habitats with thicker leaf litter and higher shrub density. Variables closely relating to food availability and predation risks contributed more to discriminating habitat plots from control ones, implying that the two factors played an important role in shaping their process of habitat selection. In addition, both mammals exhibited a distinct habitat use pattern from each other, and some variables, such as elevation, contributed more to their habitat separation across seasons, which can potentially reduce interspecific competition and further facilitate their coexistence in sympatry.","[Yuan, Shibin; Mu, Huaqiang; Cao, Shanshan; Zhang, Mingchun; Yang, Xuyu; Hui, Jinchu; Zhang, Zejun] China West Normal Univ, Inst Rare Anim & Plants, Nanchong 637009, Peoples R China; [Gu, Xiaodong] Sichuan Forestry Bur, Wildlife Conservat Div, Chengdu 610081, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZJ (corresponding author), China West Normal Univ, Inst Rare Anim & Plants, Nanchong 637009, Peoples R China.",zhangzj@ioz.ac.cn,"Yuan, Shibin/W-5289-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30970382, 31270570]; Giant Pandas International Cooperation Foundation of State Forestry Administration; Foundations of the National Ministry of Education for New-Century Distinguished Talents","This project was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (30970382, 31270570), Giant Pandas International Cooperation Foundation of State Forestry Administration, and Foundations of the National Ministry of Education for New-Century Distinguished Talents.

We assessed the effects of light, herbivory, water availability and the habitat an offspring came from on the survival and growth of sexual or clonal offspring (i.e, seedlings and cladodes), through 3- and 4-year common garden and short-term greenhouse experiments. 2 Shading by nurse plants increased seedling survival in the held by an order of magnitude, and a small additional advantage due to predator protection by grasses was observed. Strong herbivory transforms a facultative nurse-protege relationship for seedlings into an obligatory one. 3 In the greenhouse seedlings grew batter under shade, but in the held the production of the first cladode was delayed in seedlings in the more shaded GH, Competition for soil resources may be more intense under a dense grass tussock than under a open shrub, thus affecting the nurse-protege relationship, Seedling survival under nurse plants was similar in GH and NH, but higher plant cover suggests that a larger number of seedlings will establish in GH in the long term, 4 Cladode survival was higher in NH. Cladodes were more successful than seedlings at establishing in intercanopy areas, possibly due to physiological differences as well as their ability to survive partial predation. Cladode survival in intercanopy areas may explain the enhanced clonal propagation in the more open NH scrubland. together with their susceptibility to the flooding which affects GH. 5 The high seedling and cladode survival in the greenhouse experiments contrasted with that observed in the field, indicating that survival is determined by the interaction between herbivores, plants and abiotic conditions rather than the physiological aptitude of the plants.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; Inst Ecol EC, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico; Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Matemat Aplicadas & Sistemas, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Mandujano, MD (corresponding author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Bio MSC 3AF, POB 30001, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",,,"Mandujano, Maria C./0000-0001-9855-6645; Mendez Ramirez, Ignacio/0000-0002-1820-6846; Golubov, Jordan/0000-0002-5812-2524",,,,54,82,96,1,30,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

One such pollutant is the antidepressant fluoxetine, which has been detected in surface waters globally at levels that recent studies suggest can alter physiology and behaviour in aquatic organisms. However, wildlife exposed to pharmaceutical contaminants are typically confronted with multiple stressors simultaneously, including predation risk, which is a particularly important natural stressor that can have direct (e.g. mortality) and indirect (e.g. changed prey behaviour) fitness effects. Accordingly, we investigated potential impacts of environmentally realistic fluoxetine exposure on reproductive behaviour in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) under predation risk. Specifically, we tested whether fluoxetine exposure altered mating behaviour in male and female guppies in the presence of either a predatory spangled perch (Leiopotherapon unicolor) or a non-predatory rain bowfish (Melanotaenia splendida) control. We found that fluoxetine and the presence of a predatory spangled perch did not interact to affect reproductive behaviour. We also found that, independent of a predatory threat, fluoxetine exposure altered male mating strategy, with males in the high treatment conducting significantly more coercive 'sneak' copulations, whereas the number of courtship displays performed was not significantly affected. Moreover, while fluoxetine exposure did not significantly affect the amount of time that males and females spent following one another, we found that females, but not males, followed a potential partner less when in the presence of the predatory fish. Finally, both sexes reacted to the risk of predation by spending less time in close proximity to a predator than a non-predator. In combination, our findings highlight the capacity of fluoxetine to influence processes of sexual selection at field-realistic concentrations and emphasise the importance of considering multiple stressors when assessing impacts of pharmaceutical pollutants on the behaviour of wildlife.

Despite many examples of invasive plants changing animal behavior, the potential for invasive plants to alter the timing of animal activity remains unexplored. In eastern North America, invasive shrubs might have particularly strong effects on animal activity timing during spring and fall, when many invasive shrubs retain their leaves long after native species' leaves senesce. We experimentally removed an invasive shrub (buckthorn, Rhamnus cathartica) and monitored the activity timing of a ubiquitous small-mammal species (white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus) in spring, summer, and fall. We captured nearly 3 times as many P. leucopus in plots invaded by R. cathartica compared with plots with R. cathartica removed, and P. leucopus were captured 2 h earlier in invaded plots. Regardless of invasion treatment, P. leucopus appear to follow a common rule to set activity timing: P. leucopus were only active below a threshold of ground-level moonlight illuminance (0.038 lux). Diel and monthly lunar cycles play an important role in regulating small-mammal activity, but our data suggest that decreased light penetration dampens the influence of moonlight illuminance in habitats invaded by R. cathartica, allowing P. leucopus to remain active throughout the night. By changing the temporal niche of ubiquitous native animals, invasive shrubs may have unappreciated effects on many ecological interactions, including processes that alter community diversity and affect human health.","[Guiden, Peter W.; Orrock, John L.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Integrat Biol, 250 N Mills St, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Guiden, PW (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Integrat Biol, 250 N Mills St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",guiden@wisc.edu,,,"American Society of Mammologists; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1144752, DEB-1439550]","This work was supported by a Grant-In-Aid from the American Society of Mammologists, and by the National Science Foundation (grant numbers DGE-1144752 and DEB-1439550).",,60,3,3,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Methods: In total, 220 samples were taken at 180 sampling locations during the years 2010 and 2012. Sampling sites were characterized based on physical, chemical and biological attributes. The predictive performance of decision tree models was evaluated based on correctly classified instances (CCI), Cohen's kappa statistic (kappa) and the determination coefficient (R-2). A conditional analysis was performed on the regression tree models to test the relation between key environmental and biological parameters and the abundance of mosquito larvae. Results: The decision tree model developed for anopheline larvae showed a good model performance (CCI = 84 +/- 2%, and kappa = 0.66 +/- 0.04), indicating that the genus has clear habitat requirements. Anopheline mosquito larvae showed a widespread distribution and especially occurred in small human-made aquatic habitats. Water temperature, canopy cover, emergent vegetation cover, and presence of predators and competitors were found to be the main variables determining the abundance and distribution of anopheline larvae. In contrast, anopheline mosquito larvae were found to be less prominently present in permanent larval habitats. This could be attributed to the high abundance and diversity of natural predators and competitors suppressing the mosquito population densities. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that targeting smaller human-made aquatic habitats could result in effective larval control of anopheline mosquitoes in the study area. Controlling the occurrence of mosquito larvae via drainage of permanent wetlands may not be a good management strategy as it negatively affects the occurrence and abundance of mosquito predators and competitors and promotes an increase in anopheline population densities.","[Mereta, Seid Tiku] Jimma Univ, Dept Environm Hlth Sci & Technol, Jimma, Ethiopia; [Yewhalaw, Delenasaw] Jimma Univ, Dept Biol, Jimma, Ethiopia; [Mereta, Seid Tiku; Boets, Pieter; Goethals, Peter L.

However, little is known about the drivers promoting changes in soil fauna abundance on a local scale. We explored this gap of knowledge in a mixed oak forest of Southern Spain, which is under decline due to the invasion of the exotic soil-borne pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. Meso-invertebrate abundance found in soil litter was estimated at the suborder level. We then explored their statistical correlations with respect to light availability, tree and litter characteristics, and P. cinnamomi abundance. Oribatida and Entomobryomporpha were the most abundant groups of Acari and Collembola, respectively. According to their trophic level, predator and detritivore abundances were positively correlated while detritivores were, in turn, positively correlated with pathogen abundance and negatively influenced by light availability and tree defoliation. These overall trends differed between groups. Among detritivores, Diplopoda preferred highly decomposed litter while Oribatida and Psocoptera preferred darker environments and Poduromorpha were selected for environments with lower tree defoliation. Our results show the predominant role of light availability in influencing litter fauna abundances at local scales and suggest that the invasive soil-borne pathogen P. cinnamomi is integrated in these complex relationships.","[Jimenez-Chacon, Alejandro] Univ Seville, Adv Biol Res & Applicat, Edificio Verde,Calle Prof Garcia Gonzalez S-N, E-41012 Seville, Spain; [Homet, Pablo; Matias, Luis; Gomez-Aparicio, Lorena; Godoy, Oscar] CSIC, IRNAS, Inst Recursos Nat & Agrobiol Sevilla, Ave Reina Mercedes 10, Seville 41012, Spain; [Matias, Luis] Univ Jaen, Fac Ciencias Expt, Dept Biol Anim Biol Vegetal & Ecol, Campus Lagunillas SN, Jaen 23009, Spain","Godoy, O (corresponding author), CSIC, IRNAS, Inst Recursos Nat & Agrobiol Sevilla, Ave Reina Mercedes 10, Seville 41012, Spain.",jch.alejandro@gmail.com; pablo.homet@gmail.com; lmatias@irnas.csic.es; lorenag@irnase.csic.es; ogodoy@irnas.csic.es,"Matias, Luis/K-6761-2014; Gomez-Aparicio, Lorena/K-6905-2014; Godoy, Oscar/D-3976-2011; Homet, Pablo/AAX-2244-2021; Matias, Luis/H-6184-2015","Godoy, Oscar/0000-0003-4988-6626; Matias, Luis/0000-0001-5603-5390",European Union Horizon research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant [661118-BioFUNC]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the IMPLANTIN project [CGL2015-65346-R]; MICINN project INTERCAPA [CGL-2014-56739-R],"We are deeply grateful to the Jaime Gonzalez Gordon Foundation for providing permission to build the rainfall exclusion infrastructure on their property as well as constant for the support throughout the experiment.

Unbaited and caged bolts were included in the experiments as controls. Attraction of beetles to the bolts and subsequent emergence were estimated using traps. Six phloem-feeding species (potential competitors of T. piniperda) and four predatory species were caught in significantly higher numbers at the baited bolts than at the unbaited ones. The number of offspring and the productivity of T piniperda were four to seven times higher in unbaited bolts than in baited bolts. Exclusion of other insects, by using cages, resulted in a nine-fold increase in the number of T. piniperda offspring per square meter and productivity (offspring per egg gallery) compared with unbaited, exposed bolts. Hylurgops palliatus (Gyll.) (Scolytidae) and Rhagium inquisitor (L.) (Cerambycidae) attacked both the baited and unbaited bolts, whereas Acanthocinus aedilis (L.)

Knowledge about the ecology of A. rubens in these highly seasonal systems is largely limited to studies of interspecific competition for prey. Two experiments in an oscillatory wave tank were used to test the hypothesis that wave action and starvation modulate displacement, microhabitat selection, and ability to contact mussel (Mytilus edulis) prey in A. rubens from southeastern Newfoundland. Both experiments were carried out in two seasons (winter and summer) to quantify intra-annual variation in the effects of wave action (three wave velocities: null [0.0 m s(-1)], low [0.1 m s(-1)], and high [0.2 m s(-1)]) and starvation (two levels: fed and starved three weeks). Experiment 1, in which two sea stars were allowed to displace and make contact with six microhabitats typifying natural seabed heterogeneity, showed that A. rubens displaced up to 50% less with increasing wave velocity. Displacement was 120% higher in summer than winter and lower in starved than fed individuals in summer only. The sea star predominantly stayed on flat horizontal surfaces, did so more frequently in the presence than absence of waves, and spent more time in the two most uneven microhabitats in winter than summer regardless of wave velocity. Experiment 2, in which one sea star in the centre of a depression was allowed to move to the top of surrounding mounds, showed that more sea stars that left the centre of the depression reached the top of the mounds in summer than winter, in the absence than presence of waves, and when starved than fed. Sea stars that reached the top of mounds spent more time there in the presence than absence of mussels in summer only, when starved than fed in summer only, and in the presence than absence of mussels at null and low wave velocities. Measurements of wave height, sea temperature, and A. rubens abundance over six months at one subtidal site indicated that the sea star was >4 times more abundant at 8 m than at 2 m and 4 m. This difference was unrelated to temperature and likely mainly caused by the wave environment. Collectively, results demonstrate that wave action, and to a lesser extent starvation, are key modulators of the inclination and ability of A. rubens to explore its environment and localize prey. In southeastern Newfoundland, the response of A. rubens to wave action and starvation is adaptable, being generally stronger in summer than winter, when sea temperature is markedly lower.

Beginning in the 1940s-1950s, state and federal resource management agencies initiated water development programs intended to benefit game species and other wildlife. At least 5,859 such developments have been built in 11 western states. Most state wildlife management agencies in the western United States have ongoing wildlife water development programs that vary greatly in extent. Ranchers and range managers also have developed water sources for livestock, many of which also are used by wildlife. Recently, critics have suggested that wildlife water developments have not yielded expected benefits, and may negatively impact wildlife by increasing predation, competition, and disease transmission. Based upon a comprehensive review of scientific literature, we conclude that wildlife water developments have likely benefitted many game and non-game species, blur not all water development projects have yielded expected increases in animal distribution and abundance. Hypothesized negative impacts of water developments on wildlife are not supported by data and remain largely speculative. However, our understanding of both positive and negative effects of wildlife water developments is incomplete, because of design limitations of previous research. Longterm, experimental studies are needed to address unanswered questions concerning the efficacy and ecological effects of water developments. We also recommend that resource managers apply more rigorous planning criteria to new developments, and expand monitoring efforts associated with water development programs.","Arizona Game & Fish Dept, Phoenix, AZ 85023 USA; Texas Tech Univ, Dept Range Wildlife & Fisheries Management, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA","Rosenstock, SS (corresponding author), Arizona Game & Fish Dept, 2221 W Greenway Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85023 USA.",,,,,,,123,94,100,1,36,SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT,LAKEWOOD,"445 UNION BLVD, STE 230, LAKEWOOD, CO 80228-1259 USA",0022-409X,,,J RANGE MANAGE,J.

In the Nalon River basin (North Spain), a catchment subject to historical mining activities, ten macroinvertebrate taxa (4 mayflies, 1 perlid stonefly, 2 caddisflies, 2 oligochaete worms, and 1 blackfly) were collected from unpolluted reference sites in the study area, and the sites were assessed as having High or Good ecological status based on their macroinvertebrate communities to establish a metal bioaccumulation reference condition. For each taxon, tissue concentrations of seven metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Hg, and Zn) and two metalloids (As and Se) were measured and interpreted as natural baseline tissue concentrations that reflected the natural variability of the region. The taxa selected as biomonitors represented 5 different feeding styles in the benthic community: deposit-feeders, scrapers, filterers, generalists and predators, and bioaccumulation was analyzed both by taxon and feeding style as well as general habits (endo- vs epi-benthic) and river type. For each taxon, ecological threshold tissue concentrations (ETTC) were calculated as the 90th percentile (P90) of the baseline data distribution. In most instances, the deposit-feeders (aquatic lumbricid and microdrile oligochaetes) showed the highest ETTCs, except for Cu and Zn, which were mainly bioaccumulated by generalist Ephemerellidae, followed by scraper Heptageniidae in the case of Cu. The P90 values were derived from organisms in unaltered reference conditions as estimates of the no-observed-effect concentrations (NOEC), and should provide an approach to ETTCs for the field macroinvertebrate taxa of the region below which the alteration of the benthic community is unlikely. For each metal and metalloid, the P9Os for the 10 taxa were entered in a species-sensitivity-distribution model, and the median hazard concentration (HC50) for the macroinvertebrate community was calculated. The ecological threshold concentrations in the biota calculated in this study are proposed for use as a screening tool in the environmental risk assessment of the Nalon River basin and the Cantabrian region, allowing metal exceedance in the selected biomonitors to further research using other lines of evidence under the European Water Framework directive.","[Rodriguez, Pilar; Mendez-Fernandez, Leire] Univ Basque Country, Dept Zool & Anim Cellular Biol, UPV EHU, Box 644, Bilbao 48080, Spain; [Pardo, Isabel; Costas, Noemi] Univ Vigo, Dept Aquat Ecol & Anim Biol, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Martinez-Madrid, Maite] Univ Basque Country, Dept Genet Phys Anthropol & Anim Physiol, UPV EHU, Box 644, Bilbao 48080, Spain","Rodriguez, P (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, Dept Zool & Anim Cellular Biol, UPV EHU, Box 644, Bilbao 48080, Spain.",pilar.rodriguez@ehu.eus,"FERNANDEZ, LEIRE MENDEZ/Y-4851-2019; Martinez, Maite/Z-5568-2019; Pardo, Isabel/AAN-4795-2020","FERNANDEZ, LEIRE MENDEZ/0000-0002-0724-3801; Martinez, Maite/0000-0003-1527-9705; Pardo, Isabel/0000-0002-4553-1310; Rodriguez, Pilar/0000-0001-8387-1669","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MINECO, Spain) [CGL 2013-44655-R]; University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU, Spain), in 2016-2018","This investigation has been part of the CGL 2013-44655-R research project sponsored by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MINECO, Spain).

Both males and females of the lizard Eulamprus heatwolei display two behavioral types of a behavioral syndrome, defined by correlations between territorial, exploratory, and predator avoidance behaviors. We tested how this variation in behavioral syndrome influences reproductive success, pairing patterns, and offspring weight. We used spatial behavior and residency in the field to identify territorial and floater individuals. Females were relocated to the laboratory to give birth, and all offspring, dams, and potential sires were genotyped to determine offspring paternity. During field surveys, 164 lizards were caught of which 27.5% were territorial and the rest were floaters. Paternity was assigned to 66% of the 104 offspring produced by 33 dams. Territorial sires fathered a greater proportion of the offspring of territorial dams than floater sires. Larger territorial males were more likely to sire the entire clutch or share paternity with fewer additional sires than smaller territorial males. Floater sire size, however, did not influence the number of fathers per litter. Floater females produced heavier offspring than their territorial counterparts, and offspring fathered by floaters were heavier than maternal half-sibs fathered by territorial males. We speculate that differences in offspring weight may be the result of differences in yolk provisioning by females and parent genetic compatibility.","Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Stapley, J (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Dept Anim Plants & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",stapley@biology.biol.wits.ac.za,"Stapley, Jessica/B-3858-2010; Keogh, Scott/C-8441-2009","Stapley, Jessica/0000-0002-9138-5684; Keogh, Scott/0000-0002-1373-6186",,,,43,44,47,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

A repatriation effort via stocking of juvenile P. lucius in the San Juan River, NM, CO and UT has resulted in limited recruitment of individuals into an adult population. Understanding biotic and abiotic factors that limit their persistence in the Colorado River basin will be a critical step in providing for their recovery. To elucidate potential recruitment barriers in the San Juan River, we assessed relationships between the numbers of two age classes of P. lucius and prey, competitors and predators collected at a 1.6 km reach scale between 2003 and 2012. We used an information theoretical approach to rank candidate models testing the relative importance of these biotic conditions in predicting the spatial distribution of P. lucius. We found positive relationships between the numbers of P. lucius <= 200 mm total length (TL) collected and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of native prey among reaches. For P. lucius >200 mm TL (individuals that are likely completely piscivorous), we found positive associations between the numbers of P. lucius collected and CPUE of total prey and CPUE of potential non-native competitors in each reach. Our data suggest size-specific affinities of P. lucius for native and non-native prey as well as the potential for negative interactions between P. lucius and non-native competitors may contribute to limited recruitment of juvenile P. lucius into an adult population in the San Juan River.","[Franssen, Nathan R.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Franssen, Nathan R.] Univ New Mexico, Museum Southwestern Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Durst, Scott L.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, New Mexico Ecol Serv Field Off, San Juan River Basin Recovery Implementat Program, Albuquerque, NM 87113 USA","Franssen, NR (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, 167 Castetter Hall, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",nrfranssen@gmail.com,,,,,,33,6,6,0,33,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

However, individuals rarely maximize their growth rates, suggesting that this carries costs. One such cost could be faster attrition of the telomeres that cap the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and play an important role in chromosome protection. A relatively short telomere length is indicative of poor biological state, including poorer tissue and organ performance, reduced potential longevity and increased disease susceptibility. Telomere loss during growth may also be accelerated by environmental factors, but these have rarely been subjected to experimental manipulation in the natural environment. Using a wild system involving experimental manipulations of juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in Scottish streams, we found that telomere length in juvenile fish was influenced by parental traits and by direct environmental effects. We found that faster-growing fish had shorter telomeres and there was a greater cost (in terms of reduced telomere length) if the growth occurred in a harsher environment. We also found a positive association between offspring telomere length and the growth history of their fathers (but not mothers), represented by the number of years fathers had spent at sea. This suggests that there may be long-term consequences of growth conditions and parental life history for individual longevity.","[Mclennan, D.; Boner, W.; Monaghan, P.; Metcalfe, N.

To address sex-based aspects of population structure, I evaluated sex ratios, co-occurrence of the sexes, correlations of abundance of the sexes, and dispersion of individuals of each sex for each of 34 hostectoparasite associations from Paraguayan bats. Of the 34 hostectoparasite associations, 23 exhibited positive co-occurrence, 27 exhibited positive correlation of abundances, three exhibited male sex bias, one exhibited female sex bias, 27 had clumped distributions of males, and 26 had clumped distributions of females. No associations exhibited negative co-occurrence, negative correlation of abundance, or hyperdispersed males or females. There was no evidence for sexual segregation, sex-based niche partitioning, or intrasexual selection in any hostectoparasite association. Previously proposed mechanisms (e.g. pre-partum sex bias, local mate competition, or mortality from host grooming) fail to explain observed patterns of sex bias. For ectoparasites of hosts that occupy permanent roost sites, sex-specific behaviour related to reproduction may make females more susceptible to off-host predation, and less likely to be present in samples from bats captured away from the roost.

A 2x5 factorial design field experiment performed with large mesocosms for >2 months was used to quantify the dynamics of the entire HMFW (bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates, and viruses) after an experimental P-enrichment gradient which approximated or surpassed current atmospheric P pulses in the presence vs. absence of ultraviolet radiation. HMFW underwent a mid-term (<20 days) acute development following a noticeable unimodal response to P enrichment, which peaked at intermediate P-enrichment levels and, unexpectedly, was more accentuated under ultraviolet radiation. However, after depletion of dissolved inorganic P, the HMFW collapsed and was outcompeted by a low-diversity autotrophic compartment, which constrained the development of HMFW and caused a significant loss of functional biodiversity. The dynamics and relationships among variables, and the response patterns found, suggest the importance of biotic interactions (predation/parasitism and competition) in restricting HMFW development, in contrast to the role of abiotic factors as main drivers of autotrophic compartment. The response of HMFW may contribute to ecosystem resilience by favoring the maintenance of the peculiar paths of energy and nutrient-mobilization in these pristine ecosystems, which are vulnerable to threats by the joint action of abiotic stressors related to global change.","[Manuel Medina-Sanchez, Juan; Antonio Delgado-Molina, Jose; Jose Bullejos, Francisco; Villar-Argaiz, Manuel] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, Granada, Spain; [Bratbak, Gunnar] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, Bergen, Norway; [Carrillo, Presentacion] Univ Granada, Inst Agua, Granada, Spain","Medina-Sanchez, JM (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, Granada, Spain.",jmmedina@ugr.es,"Bratbak, Gunnar/N-8786-2015; Villar-Argaiz, Manuel/L-9085-2014; Carrillo, Presentacion/I-1601-2015; Carrillo, Francisco Jose Bullejos/K-4971-2015; Medina-Sanchez, Juan Manuel/A-4703-2013","Bratbak, Gunnar/0000-0001-8388-4945; Villar-Argaiz, Manuel/0000-0002-3288-8900; Carrillo, Presentacion/0000-0003-3794-4294; Carrillo, Francisco Jose Bullejos/0000-0002-0335-3923; Medina-Sanchez, Juan Manuel/0000-0003-0991-9331","Junta de Andalucia (Excelencia)Junta de Andalucia [P07-CVI-02598, P09-RNM-5376]; Spanish Ministries of Medio Ambiente; Rural y Marino [PN2009/067]; Ciencia e Innovacion [GLC2008-01127/BOS, CGL2011-23681]; ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [250254]; Spanish governmentSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission","This research was supported by Junta de Andalucia (Excelencia P07-CVI-02598 to PC, and P09-RNM-5376 to JMMS), the Spanish Ministries of Medio Ambiente, Rural y Marino (PN2009/067 to PC) and Ciencia e Innovacion (GLC2008-01127/BOS and CGL2011-23681 to PC), the ERC Advanced Grant project number 250254 MINOS'' (to GB), and two Spanish government grants (to JADM and FJB).

This paper proposes a new methodology incorporated a recent meta-heuristic algorithm named parasitism-predation algorithm (PPA) to estimate the optimal parameters of SOFC equivalent circuit. Two experiments are conducted in this work; the first one comprises four measured datasets for a commercial enhanced cylindrical SOFC manufactured by Siemen Energy. While the second series consists of five measured datasets for a theoretical 5oKWTHORN dynamic SOFC stack with 96 connected cells. The collected datasets are measured at different operating conditions. An excessive comparative study is presented with other optimizers of comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO), improved PSO with difference mean with perturbation (DMP_PSO), heterogeneous CLPSO (HCLPSO), locally informed PSO (LIPS), modified CSO with tri-competitive mechanism (MCSO), opposition-based learning competitive PSO (OBLCPSO), ranking-based biased learning swarm optimizer (RBLSO), competitive swarm optimizer (CSO), hybrid Jaya with DE (JayaDE), and social learning PSO (SLPSO). Furthermore, statistical analyses of the ranking tests, multiple sign tests, Friedman tests, and ANOVA are performed. The obtained results confirmed the proposed PPA's competence in constructing a reliable model of SOFC as it provides the least mean square error (MSE) between the measured and estimated characteristics of 2.164e(-6) in the first series of experiments at 1073 K, in contrast, the most peer (CLPSO) provides 5.57e-6.

Changes in sympatric carnivore and dominant scavenger populations provide opportunities to assess how carnivores affect one another. Cougars (Puma concolor) were the apex predator in the Great Basin of Nevada, USA, for over 80 years. Black bears (Ursus americanus) have recently recolonized the area and are known to heavily scavenge on cougar kills. To evaluate the impacts of sympatric, recolonizing bears on cougar foraging behavior in the Great Basin, we investigated kill sites of 31 cougars between 2009 and 2017 across a range of bear densities. We modeled the variation in feeding bout duration (number of nights spent feeding on a prey item) and the proportion of primary prey, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), in cougar diets using mixed-effects models. We found that feeding bout duration was driven primarily by the size of the prey item being consumed, local bear density, and the presence of dependent kittens. The proportion of mule deer in cougar diet across all study areas declined over time, was lower for male cougars, increased with the presence of dependent kittens, and increased with higher bear densities. In sites with feral horses (Equus ferus), a novel large prey, cougar consumption of feral horses increased over time. Our results suggest that higher bear densities over time may reduce cougar feeding bout durations and influence the prey selection trade-off for cougars when alternative, but more dangerous, large prey are available. Shifts in foraging behavior in multicarnivore systems can have cascading effects on prey selection. This study highlights the importance of measuring the impacts of sympatric apex predators and dominant scavengers on a shared resource base, providing a foundation for monitoring dynamic multipredator/scavenger systems.","[Engebretsen, Kristin N.; Young, Julie K.] Utah State Univ, Deparment Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Beckmann, Jon P.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bozeman, MT USA; [Lackey, Carl W.; Schroeder, Cody; Jackson, Pat] Nevada Dept Wildlife, Game Div, Reno, NV USA; [Andreasen, Alyson] Univ Nevada, Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Young, Julie K.] USDA, NWRC, Predator Res Facil, 4200 South 600 East Cache Cty Rd, Millville, UT 84326 USA; Kansas Dept Wildlife Parks & Tourism, Pratt, KS USA","Young, JK (corresponding author), USDA, NWRC, Predator Res Facil, 4200 South 600 East Cache Cty Rd, Millville, UT 84326 USA.",julie.k.young@usda.gov,,"Engebretsen, Kristin/0000-0002-8953-6228","Nevada Division of Wildlife; Pittman-Robertson Funds; Wildlife Conservation Society; University of Nevada, Reno, Agricultural Experiment Station; Nevada Bighorns Unlimited-Reno chapter; Nevada Wildlife Record Book; Carson Valley Chukar Club; Northern Nevada Chapter of the Safari Club International; Nevada Division of State Lands-Lake Tahoe License Plate Grant; Nevada Wildlife Heritage Fund; U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Wildlife Research Center","Nevada Division of Wildlife; Pittman-Robertson Funds; Wildlife Conservation Society; University of Nevada, Reno, Agricultural Experiment Station, Nevada Bighorns Unlimited-Reno chapter; Nevada Wildlife Record Book; Carson Valley Chukar Club; Northern Nevada Chapter of the Safari Club International; Nevada Division of State Lands-Lake Tahoe License Plate Grant; Nevada Wildlife Heritage Fund; U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Wildlife Research Center",,51,1,1,6,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Although NTRs can influence trophic ones, network models, including both types of interactions (multi-interaction network, IN) and changes in the role of nodes when NTRs are added to TN, are scarce. To evaluate the role of NTRs in freshwater shallow ecosystems, where these interactions are relevant mainly in the benthic habitat, we constructed, from the same communities, the two mentioned networks and compared them focusing on the nodes' topological roles. Our approach is based on empirical data from a mesocosm experiment where aquatic communities inhabited coupled habitats (pelagic, within-meadow and benthic) under three environmental scenarios: warming, increased ultraviolet radiation, plus control conditions. The experiment allowed us to assess: the topological roles of the nodes from different habitats when NTRs were added to the TN, and the relative impact of adding NTRs according to environmental scenarios. We calculated a set of node indices by considering both direct and indirect connections up to an ecologically meaningful number of steps. Our results highlight significant differences in the nodes' roles between both network versions. When NTRs were added: i) pelagic nodes lost relevance in the network; ii) the number of within-meadow relevant nodes increased and iii) the large benthic consumers in TN were substituted by charophytes, plus a chain of small within-meadow predators/preys, as the most relevant to the IN. Furthermore, the scenarios modulated changes in the nodes' roles when including NTRs. The warming scenario promotes the central position of some nodes (e.g. charophytes) and harms others (e.g. benthic cladocerans), and UVR modulates changes in benthic filamentous primary producers' roles. Therefore, the inclusion of NTRs in ecological models seems crucial to better understand the functioning of complex communities and their response to environmental disturbances.","[Puche, Eric; Rodrigo, Maria A.; Rojo, Carmen] Univ Valencia, Cavanilles Inst Biodivers & Evolutionary Biol, Valencia, Spain; [Jordan, Ferenc] Ctr Ecol Res, Balaton Limnol Inst, Tihany, Hungary; [Jordan, Ferenc] Ctr Ecol Res, Evolutionary Syst Res Grp, Tihany, Hungary","Puche, E (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Cavanilles Inst Biodivers & Evolutionary Biol, Valencia, Spain.",eric.puche@uv.es,"Puche, Eric/ABF-2177-2020; Rodrigo, Maria/K-9079-2014","Puche, Eric/0000-0003-1725-419X; Rodrigo, Maria/0000-0003-4106-0643","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2014-54502-C2-1-P]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (EC FERED funding); Univ. of Valencia [UV-INV-PREDOC16F1-383810]; National Research, Development and Innovation Office -NKFIH [GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00057]","The Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness supported this study for research project CGL2014-54502-C2-1-P (including EC FERED funding).

Despite this, experimental tests of the healthy herds hypothesis, wherein predators influence pathogen transmission, are rare. Moreover, no studies have separated effects mediated by density vs. traits. Using a semi-natural mesocosm experiment, we investigated the interactive effects of predatory dragonfly larvae (caged or lethal [free-ranging]) and a viral pathogen, ranavirus, on larval amphibians (grey treefrogs and northern leopard frogs). We determined the influence of predators on ranavirus transmission and the relative importance of density- and trait-mediated effects on observed patterns. Lethal predators reduced ranavirus infection prevalence by 57%-83% compared to no-predator and caged-predator treatments. The healthy herds effect was more strongly associated with reductions in tadpole density than behavioural responses to predators. We also assessed whether ranavirus altered the responses of tadpoles to predators. In the absence of virus, tadpoles reduced activity levels and developed deeper tails in the presence of predators. However, there was no evidence that virus presence or infection altered responses to predators. Finally, we compared the magnitude of trophic cascades initiated by individual and combined natural enemies. Lethal predators initiated a trophic cascade by reducing tadpole density, but caged predators and ranavirus did not. The absence of a virus-induced trophic cascade is ostensibly the consequence of limited virus-induced mortality and the ability of infected individuals to continue interacting within the community. Our results provide support for the healthy herds hypothesis in amphibian communities. We uniquely demonstrate that density-mediated effects of predators outweigh trait-mediated effects in driving this pattern. Moreover, this study was one of the first to directly compare trophic cascades caused by predators and pathogens.

Although the main factors potentially influencing cannibalism are apparently well investigated, relatively little is known on how these factors interact to influence the frequency of cannibalism. We performed 2 complementary experiments to test if cannibalism in larvae of the pit-building antlion Myrmeleon hyalinus is influenced by size differences within and between developmental stages, as well as by sand depth (potential refuge), conspecific density, and hunger level. Our working hypothesis was that cannibalism should act as a threshold event governed by the interactive (rather than additive) effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. As expected, the frequency of cannibalism was higher between than within developmental stages, with more advanced instar larvae feeding on smaller instars. Notably, decreased density significantly lowered the frequency of cannibalism; however, this pattern was evident only in deep sand, which provides a potential refuge from predators. Deep sand also lessened the positive effect of body size difference on the frequency of cannibalism. Hunger level increased the frequency of cannibalism; however, the identity of the cannibal was almost exclusively determined by its initial size advantage rather than by its hunger level. Our results demonstrate that, despite their sedentary nature, the frequency of cannibalism in pit-building antlion larvae can be relatively high. Furthermore, this trophic interaction is governed by the interactive rather than additive effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing cannibalism.Despite their sedentary nature, the frequency of cannibalism in pit-building antlion larvae can be higher than that of other cannibalistic predators. In contrast to traditional thinking, we show that the frequency of cannibalism in pit-building antlion larvae is strongly influenced by the interactive, rather than the additive, effects of intrinsic (body mass difference, hunger level) and extrinsic factors (density, sand depth).","[Barkae, Erez David; Golan, Ohad; Ovadia, Ofer] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Barkae, ED (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",barkaeer@post.bgu.ac.il,,"Ovadia, Ofer/0000-0002-4941-4947",,,,54,10,12,1,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

In this review, we focus on the role of secondary metabolism in driving antagonistic arthropod-fungus interactions, i.e., where fungi serve as a food source to fungal grazers, compete with saprophagous insects, and attack insects as hosts for growth and reproduction. Although a wealth of studies on animal-fungus interactions point to a crucial role of secondary metabolites in deterring animal feeding and resisting immune defense strategies, causal evidence often remains to be provided. Moreover, it still remains an unresolved puzzle as to what extent the tight regulatory control of secondary metabolite formation in some model fungi represents an evolved chemical defense system favored by selective pressure through animal antagonists. Given these gaps in knowledge, we highlight some co-evolutionary aspects of secondary metabolism, such as induced response, volatile signaling, and experimental evolution, which may help in deciphering the ecological importance and evolutionary history of secondary metabolite production in fungi.

However, the neighboring patch might already be used by con- or heterospecific herbivores. We used laboratory bioassays to examine whether perception of odor from con- or heterospecific competitors on a neighbored lima bean leaf patch influences dispersal behavior of the herbivorous mite Tetranychus urticae when attacked by predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis. The dispersal rates of T. urticae that perceived odors from leaf patches infested by conspecifics or cowpea aphids (Aphis craccivora) did not differ from the control (the dispersal rate of T. urticae that perceived odor from uninfested leaf patches). By contrast, the dispersal rate of T. urticae was reduced when they perceived odors from leaf patches that were currently or had previously been infested by larvae of the common cutworm (Spodoptera litura). Previous herbivory by S. litura larvae induced resistance in leaf patches to T. urticae as indicated by the reduced number of eggs laid by T. urticae. Our results are discussed with respect to the feeding behavior of the tested competitors of T. urticae and the impact of the plant and arthropod community on the dispersal behavior of these mites.","[Choh, Yasuyuki; Takabayashi, Junji] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan","Takabayashi, J (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsuka 509-3, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",junji@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Takabayashi, Junji/G-2212-2010","Takabayashi, Junji/0000-0002-3575-9952",Kyoto University [A06],We thank Hiroyuki Takemoto for help with the experiments.

We studied how predatory fish affect subsurface sediment use by spiny- and smooth-shelled morphs of the mudsnail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, on New Zealand's South Island. Spines reduce consumption risk by small benthic fishes (e.g., bullies [Gobiomorphus spp.]). Thus, we predicted that spiny morphs would be more likely to use sediment surfaces with relatively high algal food supplies than the more vulnerable smooth morphs when exposed to fish predators. Epi- and endobenthic samples from 5 streams with fish showed that similar to 80% of snails typically were retrieved from subsurface sediments, whereas only 33% of snails from fishless Jackson's Creek occurred in subsurface sediments. A laboratory experiment revealed that significantly more snails used subsurface sediments when with common bullies (G. cotidianus) than when without. Subsurface sediment use in the presence of bullies was similar between shell morphs, a result suggesting that use of spatial refugia might be a more important predator defense than shell armature for Potamopyrgus. Regardless of fish presence, more spiny than smooth morphs burrowed into sand, but subsurface use did not differ between shell morphs in cobbles and gravel. Fewer snails were active on rock surfaces at night than during the day in a stream run, apparently to reduce encounters with nocturnally hunting bullies and shortfinned eels (Anguilla australis). Our results suggest that if fish predation pressure were reduced, then surface densities of Potamopyrgus would increase significantly. Given the snail's superior competitive abilities, this increase could alter top-down and bottom-up effects in food chains and threaten local biodiversity.","[Holomuzki, Joseph R.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Mansfield, OH 44906 USA; [Lowe, Rex L.] Bowling Green State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Biggs, Barry J.

Here we use a mechanistic simulation model of a three-level food web to explore the effect of initial body size variation among herbivores on final plant abundance resulting from a non-linear relationship between population demography and body size. We show that initial herbivore body size variation has a negative effect on their survival and consequently a positive effect on the final plant biomass. We then use trait distribution, in combination with body size-survival and body size-fitness curves estimated through simulations, to generate predictions for comparison with observed food web effects. We show that, owing to frequency-dependence, our ability to predict herbivore population dynamics is limited. However, at the community-level, this frequency-dependence, as well as changes in herbivore population size, can be abstracted safely and the strength of plant-herbivore interactions can be simply predicted from initial body size distribution in combination with the survival curve. our findings suggest a need to revisit classical theory in community ecology. Doing so will require the mechanistic study of population demography and experimental testing of the effect of trait variation on community dynamics. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Effective management of predator-prey systems requires a solid understanding of kill rates, prey use, and selection. We implemented a 3-year study in northeast Oregon to investigate cougar diet, kill rates, and prey selection in a multiple-prey system to assess the degree to which patterns in cougar predation may be generalizable across systems and to identify selective predation patterns of cougars that may affect ungulate populations. We marked 25 adult cougars with global positioning system (GPS) collars and monitored predation sequences for 7,642 days to identify kill sites. In field investigation of kill sites, we identified remains of 1,213 prey items killed by cougars, of which 1,158 (95.4%) were native ungulates. On average, cougars killed 1.03 ungulates/week (95% CI=0.92-1.14), but kill rates varied by season, sex, and reproductive status of cougars. Cougars killed ungulate prey 1.55 (95% CI=1.47-1.66) times more frequently during summer (May-Oct) than winter (Nov-Apr). Kill rates were higher in summer because juvenile ungulates were the most frequently killed prey item and were smaller than prey killed in winter. Female cougars with kittens >6 months old killed prey more frequently than males, solitary females, and females with kittens <6 months old likely in response to the increased energetic burden of raising kittens. Male cougars killed larger prey than females, which likely explains why males killed at similar rates as solitary females, despite the larger body size of males. We documented patterns in prey selection influenced by season and demographic classification of cougars. Diets of male cougars included roughly equal amounts of elk (52.2%) and deer (47.8%), whereas diets of females were dominated by deer (74.6%). Male and female cougars displayed strong patterns of selection for elk calves during summer. During winter, female cougars selected deer fawns and males selected elk calves. Female cougars with kittens >6 months old demonstrated little selection for any age class or species of prey, highlighting an opportunistic foraging strategy to maximize energy gains while feeding young. Across all cougars, we observed a pattern of selection for adult male deer during winter but not summer and did not observe patterns of selection for adult elk according to sex. Our results strongly supported the hypothesis proposed by [Knopff et al. (2010) Journal of Wildlife Management, 74: 1435-1447] that cougar predation is influenced by season and demographic classifications of cougars and our results provide strong evidence that this hypothesis should be generalizable to other areas. The patterns of selection for juvenile elk and deer suggested wildlife managers should consider the potential negative effects of cougars on ungulate populations in areas where juvenile recruitment has been chronically low.

Increasing the rate of glyphosate from 450 to 900 g/ha (registered rate) had no further effect on any measured parameter. Seed viability was not affected by glyphosate rate nor application timing. Corn yield declined only at a glyphosate rate of 225 g/ha and below.

Summer declines in deposit feeding populations have been ascribed to food limitation and to the seasonal influx of predators. We used a bioassay approach to test the following hypotheses: (1) Sediment supports more population growth in the spring and early summer, relative to the late summer and fall. (2) The nutritive value of sediment declines from spring to early fall, and absorption therefore should decrease. Laboratory tests using the common deposit feeding oligochaete Paranais litoralis partially support both hypotheses. Population growth studies of spring and summer sediment show a relatively nutritionally enriched surface sediment layer, suggesting that the sediment is recharged in the late fall and winter, either by particulate organic matter deposition or microbial transformation of previously unabsorbable material. High summer temperature contributes to the negative effect of poor sediment quality. In Flax Pond, Long Island, New York, field studies show summer declines of several species of deposit feeding invertebrates, but caging studies demonstrate that predation is not a likely cause of the crashes, which proceed at similar rates inside and outside of cages.","SUNY, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT, STONY BROOK, NY 11794 USA",,,,,,,,63,52,53,0,5,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

I propose that a profitable approach to resolve this problem would be to compare life-history traits in different geographic populations of the same species. Variation in fecundity and adult survival rates across fourteen populations of Blue Tits Parus caeruleus are as large as those among eleven tits Parus spp., so that comparisons among these populations can help identify selective factors that influence reproduction and survival. In a set of populations of Great Tit Parus major and Blue Tit there exists a significant inverse relation between productivity (number of young fledged per female per season) and adult annual survival rates, but not between fecundity and survival rates. I discuss experiments that help to address the question of cause and effect, and conclude that variations in productivity cause variations in survival rates. I finally present different scenarios that propose evolutionary pathways illustrating how populations could evolve from one set of life-history traits to another.","Cornell Univ, Ornithol Lab, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Dhondt, AA (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Ornithol Lab, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",aad4@cornell.edu,"Dhondt, Andre/A-8292-2008","Dhondt, Andre/0000-0002-4946-1401",,,,43,29,29,0,27,NEDERLANDSE ORNITHOLOGISCHE UNIE,ZEIST,"C/O PAUL STARMANS, OUDE ARNHEMSEWEG 261, 3705 BD ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0373-2266,2213-1175,,ARDEA,Ardea,,2001,89,1,,,SI,,155,166,,,,,12,Ornithology,Zoology,444ZF,WOS:000169431700016,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, no information exists on nest-site availability for large-bodied secondary cavity-nesters in tropical forests. We located 12 tree-cavity nests of the threatened Military Macaw (Ara militaris) in tropical dry semi-deciduous forest in Jalisco, Mexico. For each nest, we determined cavity characteristics, and compared the structure of nest-trees with nearest-neighbor trees. We also established four 100 x 50 m transects in each of deciduous, semi-deciduous, and oak forest to determine tree-cavity availability over 6 ha. Military Macaw nest-sites occurred most frequently in cavities of live Enterolobium cyclocarpum trees. Nest-trees had significantly larger diameter and ramification height than the four nearest-neighbor trees, indicating that macaws selected tall emergent trees as nest-sites. Cavities used as nest-sites by Military Macaws were also in significantly larger trees, at a greater height, and had larger entrance diameter and depth than all accessible cavities. Height above the ground was the main criteria predicting nest-cavity selection, possibly to reduce predation risk. There was also a negative correlation of nest-cavity height with depth, suggesting a tradeoff in which Military Macaws may select a nest-cavity high above the ground regardless of depth, but when using lower cavities these tend to be deeper. We found a low density of cavities with characteristics suitable for nesting, and these were concentrated in semi-deciduous forest. Our results demonstrate that the Military Macaw exhibits species-specific selection of nest-cavities, with a low density of cavities suitable for large-bodied secondary cavity-nesters in tropical forests.","[Margarita de la Parra-Martinez, Sylvia; Salinas-Melgoza, Alejandro; Guillermo Munoz-Lacy, Luis] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Posgrad Ciencias Biol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Renton, Katherine] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Estn Biol Chamela, San Patricio Melaque 48980, Jalisco, Mexico; [Salinas-Melgoza, Alejandro] Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, CONICET, Ctr Tlaxcala Biol Conducta, Tlaxcala De Xicohtencatl, Tlaxcala, Mexico","Renton, K (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Estn Biol Chamela, Apartado Postal 21, San Patricio Melaque 48980, Jalisco, Mexico.",krenton@ib.unam.mx,"Salinas-Melgoza, Alejandro/D-1789-2011","Salinas-Melgoza, Alejandro/0000-0003-2024-3061","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologiaConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [CONACyT 220278]; CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [98294, 179877]; Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (UNAM-DGAPA-PAPIIT) of UNAM [IN203012]; Loro Parque Fundacion A.C.","The study was conducted in partial fulfillment of a doctoral thesis by S.M.P.M. at the Posgrado en Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), who was supported by a student grant from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT 220278).

Such changes may influence movement of organisms, particularly belowground where soil permeability can restrict dispersal. We investigated whether earthworms, iconic ecosystem engineers, influence microarthropod movement. Our experiment tested whether movement is affected by tunnels (i.e., burrows), earthworm excreta (mucus, castings), or earthworms themselves. Earthworm burrows form tunnel networks that may facilitate movement. This effect may be enhanced by excreta, which could provide resources for microarthropods moving along the network. Earthworms may also promote movement via phoresy. Conversely, negative effects could occur if earthworms alter predator-prey relationships or change competitive interactions between microarthropods. We used microcosms consisting of a box connecting a source'' container in which microarthropods were present and a destination'' container filled with autoclaved soil. Treatments were set up within the boxes, which also contained autoclaved soil, as follows: 1) control with no burrows; 2) artificial burrows with no excreta; 3) abandoned burrows with excreta but no earthworms; and 4) earthworms (Lumbricus rubellus) present in burrows. Half of the replicates were sampled once after eight days, while the other half were sampled repeatedly to examine movement over time. Rather than performing classical pairwise comparisons to test our hypotheses, we used AIC(c) to assess support for three competing models (presence of tunnels, excreta, and earthworms). More individuals of Collembola, Mesostigmata, and all microarthropods together dispersed when tunnels were present. Models that included excreta and earthworms were less well supported. Total numbers of dispersing Oribatida and Prostigmata+Astigmata were not well explained by any models tested. Further research is needed to examine the impact of soil structure and ecosystem engineering on movement belowground, as the substantial increase in movement of some microarthropods when corridors were present suggests these factors can strongly affect colonization and community assembly.","[Cameron, Erin K.; Proctor, Heather C.; Bayne, Erin M.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Cameron, EK (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",ecameron@ualberta.ca,"Proctor, Heather C./A-2677-2014","Proctor, Heather C./0000-0002-4920-9556; Bayne, Erin/0000-0002-0679-4521",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); EMB; NSERC Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship,"This research was supported by NSERC Discovery Grants to HCP and EMB and a NSERC Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship to EKC.

Using distance sampling theory, I analyzed density estimates dating from before an application of the insecticide methamidophos (1988) and three beetle generations afterward (1994) to address the following questions. Have population densities of P. elongatus recovered to prespray levels? Are current population densities of P. elongatus in areas exposed to methamidophos in 1988 equal to those not exposed in 1988? How do population densities of P. elongatus vary with habitat type in methamidophos exposed and nonexposed areas? This work updates earlier findings that P. elongatus population densities decreased after methamidophos applications. Lingering differences in P. elongatus densities were found among areas differing in methamidophos exposure; these differences were also related to habitat type. Higher population densities were found in methamidophos exposed than in control areas; higher densities were also found in shrub dominated than in grass dominated sites, regardless of past methamidophos exposure. Because potential prey species were found to be equally abundant in methamidophos exposed and nonexposed areas despite the greater abundance of the carnivorous Pasimachus in treatment areas, the P. elongatus density patterns seen are discussed in relation to possible long-term disruption of the arthropod prey community by methamidophos. Other explanations for the observed patterns (including competitive release and physiological resistance) are also discussed.","COLORADO STATE UNIV,GRAD DEGREE PROGRAM ECOL,FT COLLINS,CO 80523","MCINTYRE, NE (corresponding author), COLORADO STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,FT COLLINS,CO 80523, USA.",,,,,,,19,4,4,0,4,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706",0046-225X,,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

R.Br.) is a C-3 perennial grass that is native to areas of south-eastern Australia. In this region, perennial grasses are important for the grazing industries because of their extended growing season and persistence over several years. This series of experiments focused on the population biology of Microlaena by studying the phenology (when seed was set), seed rain (how much seed was produced and where it fell), seed germination, germinable seedbank, seed predation and seedling recruitment in a pasture. Experiments were conducted at Chiltern, in north-eastern Victoria, on an existing native grass pasture dominated by Microlaena. Seed yields were substantial (mean 800 seeds m(-2)), with seed rain occurring over December-May. Microlaena has two distinct periods of high seed rain, in early summer and in early autumn. Seed predation is high. Within a 24-h period during peak seed production, up to 30% of Microlaena seed was removed from a pasture, primarily by ants. Microlaena seedlings recruited throughout an open paddock; however, seedling density was low (5 seedlings m(-2)). Microlaena represented only low numbers in the seedbank (0.01-0.05% of total); hence, any seedlings of Microlaena that germinate from the seedbank would face immense competition from other species. Management strategies for Microlaena-dominant pastures need to focus on the maintenance of existing plants.","[Mitchell, M.

While declining coral cover can reduce the abundance of reef fishes through direct effects on recruitment and/or mortality, recent evidence suggests that individuals may survive in disturbed habitats, but may experience sublethal reductions in their condition. This study examined the response of 2 coral associated damselfishes (Pomacentridae), Chrysiptera parasema and Dascyllus melanurus, to varying levels of live coral cover. Growth, persistence, and the condition of individuals were quantified on replicate coral colonies in 3 coral treatments: 100% live coral (control), 50% live coral (partial) and 0% live coral (dead). The growth rates of both species were directly related to the percentage live coral cover, with individuals associated with dead corals exhibiting the slowest growth, and highest growth on control corals. Such differences in individual growth between treatments were apparent after 29 d. There was no significant difference in the numbers of fishes persisting or the physiological condition of individuals between different treatments on this time-scale. Slower growth in disturbed habitats will delay the onset of maturity, reduce lifetime fecundity and increase individual's vulnerability to gape-limited predation. Hence, immediate effects on recruitment and survival may underestimate the longer-term impacts of declining coral on the structure and diversity of coral-associated reef fish communities.

A critical influence of exogenous selection on hybrid zone regulation was demonstrated by a significant relationship between environmental (salinity and temperature) and genetic (three diagnostic nuDNA loci) variation over space and time (seasons) in the Rio Churince system, Cuatro Cienegas, Mexico. At sites environmentally more similar to parental habitats, the genetic composition of hybrids was stable and similar to the resident parental species, whereas complex admixtures of parental and hybrid genotypic classes characterized intermediate environments, as did the greatest change in allelic and genotypic frequencies across seasons. Within hybrids across the entire Rio Churince system, seasonal changes in allelic and genotypic frequencies were consistent with results from previous reciprocal transplant experiments, which showed C.bifasciatus to suffer high mortality (75%) when exposed to the habitat of C.atrorus in winter (extreme temperature lows and variability) and summer (abrupt salinity change and extreme temperature highs and variability). Although unconfirmed, the distributional limits of C.atrorus and C.atrorus-like hybrids appear to be governed by similar constraints (predation or competition). The argument favouring evolutionary significance of hybridization in animals is bolstered by the results of this study, which links the importance of exogenous selection in a contemporary hybrid zone between C.atrorus and C.bifasciatus to previous demonstration of the long-term evolutionary significance of environmental variation and introgression on the phenotypic diversification Cuatro Cienegas Cyprinodon.","[Carson, Evan W.; Minckley, W.

Food chains consisting of plants, grasshoppers and wolf spiders were established in field cages placed over natural prairie. Grasshopper resource intake was manipulated by altering the abiotic environment (i.e., shading during peak grasshopper feeding times to reduce temperature and radiation), and thus the time they had available for feeding. Grasshoppers in control (unshaded) food chains compensated for spider predation by increased per capita survival and food consumption by those remaining. In this scenario, plant biomass was unaffected by the presence of spiders (i.e., no trophic cascade). However, when the grasshoppers were shaded for the morning hours, reducing their time available for feeding, spiders reduced grasshopper density, and the abundance of plants increased relative to when spiders were absent (i.e., a trophic cascade).

Understanding how such deficits impact on stakeholders' perceptions is a matter of concern in pursuing truly effective tools. Here, using as case study the heterogeneous implementation of EU sanitary regulations which allow livestock carcasses to be left in situ in the Iberian Peninsula, we evaluated how uneven implementation affects farmers' perceptions towards scavengers. We interviewed 109 farmers at the border between Spain, with designated Scavenger Feeding Zones (SFZs), and Portugal, where SFZs are still under way. We detected a deficit in the implementation of European sanitary regulation and a low knowledge of this legislation by farmers (10%), which led to marked differences between countries in the perception of farmers on scavengers. Despite being expected to benefit from SFZs, Spanish farmers valued scavengers worse than Portuguese farmers. This unexpected outcome would be mediated by ca. 95% of the Spanish farmers interviewed (n = 48) still using the carcass collection system set after the outbreak of the mad cow disease, instead of adopting the new rules allowing carcasses abandonment at SFZs. Contrastingly, ca. 28% of the Portuguese farmers (n = 61) left livestock carcasses in the field without official approval. Our results support the initial hypothesis of more positive perceptions of scavengers by farmers leaving livestock carcasses in situ, while warning against assuming effective implementation of sanitary regulations in reality.

Investment in silken tubes may give tubicolous chironomid larvae more to lose than non-tube building taxa when physical disturbances or the actions of other organisms induce dispersal. In this study, two chironomid species from flood-prone Australian tropical streams were subjected to repeated experimental destruction of their larval and pupal tubes in laboratory experiments, with life-history parameter responses recorded. 2. When subjected to the tube destruction treatments, Echinocladius martini (Orthocladiinae), whose larvae construct branched loose silken tubes in fast flow, showed no reduction in survivorship to adult, whereas Polypedilum australotropicus (Chironominae), which builds compact tightly woven tubes incorporating detrital material within pool leaf packs, showed reduced survivorship of about 25%. 3. For both species, tube destruction reduced pupal duration, regardless of whether destruction occurred in the larval stage only, or in both the larval and pupal stages. This may be a response to the risks of exposure outside tubes in nature, particularly for pupae, which are incapable of spinning silk. 4. Tube destruction caused little or no reduction in adult size, longevity, or female fecundity (oocyte number) for either species, but oocyte development and size was retarded in E. martini females, reflecting the energetic and nutritive costs of the tube destruction treatments. 5. Contrasts in the responses of the two species reflect differences in tube-building behaviour and in situ habitat use. These results demonstrate that tube loss can affect the fitness of individual chironomids, though both species proved generally resilient, which may reflect their long-term exposure to variable tropical lotic conditions.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Trop Biol, Rainforest Cooperat Res Ctr, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","McKie, BG (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",brendan.mckie@eg.umu.se,"McKie, Brendan G/C-9376-2013","McKie, Brendan/0000-0002-1796-9497",,,,52,16,16,0,4,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

We present the first systematic data on male dispersal in a provisioned multilevel group of Rhinopithecus roxellana, based on 4.5 years of field observations in Shennongjia National Nature Reserve, China. We evaluated both ultimate (inbreeding avoidance and male mating competition) and proximate (food availability and predation risk) factors influencing male dispersal. The focal group contained 34-53 individuals, in 3-4 one-male units (OMUs) and 1 all-male unit (AMU). We observed 37 dispersal events involving 10 of 11 adults, 7 of 8 subadults, and 7 of 15 juveniles. Most interunit transfers within the focal group occurred around the months of mating season. Adult males competed for the leader positions of OMUs mainly through aggressive takeovers, and young males transferred from the OMUs to the AMU at the median age of 41 months, forced out by leader males. No young males older than 4 years remained in natal or non-natal OMUs. The male mating competition hypothesis was supported. The young males emigrated voluntarily from the focal group at the average age of 58.6 months, and no young emigrating male was observed to return, suggesting inbreeding avoidance also played a role in the dispersal of young males. Most emigration/immigration events were parallel dispersal and occurred during intergroup encounters, suggesting increased predation risk during the dispersal period. Males were more likely to emigrate/immigrate during the months when preferred foods were most available. We compared the dispersal patterns in R. roxellana with those in gelada baboons and hamadryas baboons, both living in multilevel societies. Similar to R. roxellana, young male geladas disperse at puberty, but they may return and breed in their natal groups. Males in hamadryas also disperse, but much less commonly than in R. roxellana. Provisioning may have influenced results, and confirming studies on unprovisioned groups would be valuable. Am. J. Primatol. 73: 1280-1288, 2011.

The selection process is typically influenced by a variety of environmental conditions including the spatial and temporal variation in the quantity and quality of food resources, predation or disturbance risks, and inter-and intraspecific competition. Indeed, some of the most commonly employed ecological theories used to describe how animals choose foraging sites are: nutrient intake maximisation, density-dependent habitat selection, central-place foraging, and predation risk effects. Even though these theories are not mutually exclusive, rarely are multiple theoretical models considered concomitantly to assess which theory, or combination thereof, best predicts observed changes in habitat selection over space and time. Here, we tested which of the above theories best-predicted habitat selection of Svalbard-breeding pink-footed geese at their main spring migration stopover site in mid-Norway by computing a series of resource selection functions (RSFs) and their predictive ability (k-fold cross validation scores). At this stopover site geese fuel intensively as a preparation for breeding and further migration. We found that the predation risk model and a combination of the density-dependent and central-place foraging models best-predicted habitat selection during stopover as geese selected for larger fields where predation risk is typically lower and selection for foraging sites changed as a function of both distance to the roost site (i.e. central-place) and changes in local density. In contrast to many other studies, the nutritional value of the available food resources did not appear to be a major limiting factor as geese used different food resources proportional to their availability. Our study shows that in an agricultural landscape where nutritional value of food resources is homogeneously high and resource availability changes rapidly; foraging behaviour of geese is largely a tradeoff between fast refuelling and disturbance/predator avoidance.","[Chudzinska, Magda E.; van Beest, Floris M.; Nabe-Nielsen, Jacob] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Madsen, Jesper] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-8410 Ronde, Denmark","Chudzinska, ME (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",chudzinskam@gmail.com,"Nabe-Nielsen, Jacob/A-5891-2010; van Beest, Floris M./C-6745-2019; Madsen, Jesper/J-7853-2013","Nabe-Nielsen, Jacob/0000-0002-0716-9525; van Beest, Floris M./0000-0002-5701-4927; Madsen, Jesper/0000-0003-3246-0215; Chudzinska, Magda/0000-0001-9568-1504",Aarhus University,This study was part of MC's PhD project funded by Aarhus University.

Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are invasive and populations are rapidly increasing in part due to high reproductive capacity. Survival of adults is generally high, however, survival of piglets, and particularly neonates, is largely unknown. We located neonates at the natal nest and quantified survival in relation to individual and maternal biological attributes, and environmental variables. During 2017-2020, we captured 50 neonates from 13 litters and documented 28 mortalities (56%) over six weeks. Survival was positively influenced by pelage coloration, likely as a form of camouflage from predators. Male neonates had higher survival. They were born larger than females, which could be beneficial for thermoregulation and competition for milk. Neonates born to larger sows had lower survival. Sow size was positively correlated with litter size, and this finding may reflect the increased nutritional demands of sustaining large litters, or difficulties in defending more neonates against predators. Neonates born in warmer months had higher survival than those born in cooler months. Neonates are inefficient thermoregulators, thus being born in warmer months could be beneficial for maintaining homeostasis as well as access to more food resources. These are the largest and most complete data for neonate wild pig survival and will inform population models for the development of management strategies to reduce negative impacts of this destructive invasive species on native ecosystems.","[Chinn, Sarah M.; Beasley, James C.] Univ Georgia, Savannah River Ecol Lab, Aiken, SC 29803 USA; [Chinn, Sarah M.; Beasley, James C.] Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Kilgo, John C.; Vukovich, Mark A.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Southern Res Stn, New Ellenton, SC 29809 USA; [Vukovich, Mark A.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Shawnee Natl Forest, Vienna, IL 62995 USA","Chinn, SM (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Savannah River Ecol Lab, Aiken, SC 29803 USA.; Chinn, SM (corresponding author), Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",sarahchinn@uga.edu,,,U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-EM0004391]; Sigma Xi Grant in Aid of Research; agency of the United States Government;  [DE-EM0003622],"We thank P.

The effects of defoliation of the malvaceous tropical weed Sida acuta by an introduced biological control agent, the chrysomelid Calligrapha pantherina, were investigated in northern Australia with an insecticidal exclusion experiment. 2. Calligrapha pantherina was found to reduce annual seed production by an order of magnitude, from 8001 seeds m(-2) to 731 m(-2). However, there was no measurable effect on individual survival, mass per seed, or total biomass of the weed in the year of defoliation. 3. A model for annual plants was adapted and used to predict the density at flowering of the weed in the following year that would result from the measured reduction in seed output. The model predicted a fall in density from 76.0 plants m(-2) to 42.0 m(-2) in the year following defoliation. The actual density was 50.2 m(-2), not significantly different from the predicted value. 4. If this level of reduction in seed output were maintained, the density of the weed would continue to fall to a level that would depend on the searching efficiency of the beetle. However, there are still considerable uncertainties in the estimation of some of the model's plant parameters, particularly for seed losses. Moreover, the grazing and population dynamics of the beetle remain to be determined. 5. The model is used to show that the presence of seed carry-over (or generational dormancy) usually lowers plant density but, where herbivory is patchy, it reduces the rate of extinction of populations.","DEPT PRIMARY IND & FISHERIES,BERRIMAH,NT 0828,AUSTRALIA","LONSDALE, WM (corresponding author), CSIRO,DIV ENTOMOL,PMB 44,WINNELLIE,NT 0821,AUSTRALIA.",,"Lonsdale, Mark/C-1403-2008","Lonsdale, Mark/0000-0002-6163-3691",,,,29,35,36,0,14,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The goal of the present study was to evaluate patterns of spatial distribution of megalopae along a gradient in the Ubatumirim River estuary, Ubatuba region, state of Sao Paulo,Brazil. Samples were taken periodically during neap and spring tides in April and November 2005. The megalopae were collected on passive collectors made from an organic substrate, at 10 sampling sites equally spaced along the two river channels of the Ubatumirim estuary. At the laboratory, larvae were identified according to available literature. Sesarmid and ocypodid crabs predominated in the samples. Megalopae settled differently in neap- and spring-tide periods, with a tendency toward increased settlement during high-amplitude tides. The highest density of megalopae was recorded at the sites near the river mouth. The observed horizontal distribution pattern probably results from the influence of seawater or from mechanisms to avoid predation and/or competition for resources. Despite problems in identifying taxa to species level, the results of the present study contribute to increase knowledge about overall trends in the horizontal distribution of megalopae in estuarine systems.","[Nunes Pralon, Bruno Gabriel; Hirose, Gustavo Luis; Negreiros-Fransozo, Maria Lucia] Univ Estadual Paulista UNESP, NEBECC Study Grp Crustacean Biol Ecol & Culture, Dept Zool, Inst Biociencias, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Nunes Pralon, Bruno Gabriel] Univ Fed Piaui, Curso Ciencias Biol, UFPI, Piaui, Brazil; [Hirose, Gustavo Luis] Univ Fed Sergipe, Dept Biol, Ctr Ciencias Biol & Saude, Sao Cristovao, Sergipe, Brazil","Pralon, BGN (corresponding author), Univ Fed Piaui, Rua Cicero Duarte,S-N Bairro Junco, BR-6460000 Picos Pi, Picos, Brazil.",pralonbra@gmail.com,"Negreiros-Fransozo, Maria Lucia/AAU-9412-2020; Negreiros-Fransozo, Maria/H-2403-2012; Hirose, Gustavo/D-9603-2012","Negreiros-Fransozo, Maria/0000-0002-8070-8089; Hirose, Gustavo/0000-0001-7484-0393",CAPES (ouCNPq)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); FapespFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP); NEBECC,To CAPES (ouCNPq) for the master science fellowship to the first author; to Fapesp for financing infrastructure to the NEBECC's lab and field transportation; and to NEBECC members for their help during field work.

K. Koch (Juglandaceae)] foliage: the black pecan aphid, Melanocallis caryaefoliae (Davis), the yellow pecan aphid, Monelliopsis pecanis Bissell, and the blackmargined aphid, Monellia caryella (Fitch) (all Hemiptera: Aphididae). Adults of M. caryaefoliae and both the nymphs and adults of M. pecanis and M. caryella mainly feed on the lower surface of leaves. Nymphs of M. caryaefoliae appear unique by frequently feeding on the upper surface of pecan leaves. This is risky behavior given the environmental hazards (e.g., rain, solar radiation, and dislodgement) associated with the upper surface. Thus, we determined the leaf surface distribution of M. caryaefoliae on trees in an orchard and on pecan seedlings in the laboratory. A pecan orchard survey found all three aphid species and stages predominantly on the lower leaf surface, except for the nymphs of M. caryaefoliae, which were evenly distributed between upper and lower leaf surfaces. This survey also found aphidophagous lacewing (Neuroptera) larvae predominantly on the lower leaf surface, whereas ladybird beetle (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) larvae were more evenly distributed between upper and lower surfaces. Laboratory experiments using single or multiple pecan aphid species revealed M. caryaefoliae distribution on pecan seedlings similar to orchard data. Nymphal M. caryaefoliae require nearly 2 days to elicit chlorotic feeding lesions on leaves; without these lesions, nymphal development is hindered. The similar distribution of nymphs of M. caryaefoliae on both leaf surfaces likely reflects a strategy of predator avoidance allowing a proportion of the population to survive.","[Cottrell, T.

Movement of energy between systems has been shown to be important for trophic cascades in food webs, where coupling between habitats can be important for food web stability and species evenness. To investigate the effects of habitat coupling on the stability and dynamics of chlorophyll a (used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass), mediated by the abundance and composition of zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, we manipulated habitat use by the predator perch. We show a greater indirect effect of predation on phytoplankton abundance when no habitat coupling occurs, indicating a stronger predation effect and a decrease in zooplankton grazing pressure leading to an increase in phytoplankton biomass. Although we found a significant effect on chlorophyll a between the treatments, this effect was not evident in the abundance of prey resources of perch (zooplankton and macroinvertebrates). Other indirect effects, not measured in this study, such as compositional changes in prey groups, could potentially explain the lack of effect in prey resources. While there is a strong theoretical argument for the stabilizing effects of habitat coupling, empirical evidence is scarce.

COL.; SCOLYTIDAE; MORTALITY; DENSITIES; DYNAMICS,"The spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, is one of the most extensively studied European forest pests. Gaps exist in the knowledge about second generation breeding performance in bivoltine populations. In this study, the breeding performance of the second generation was evaluated in three bivoltine populations of I. typographus in the SE Alps. Length of the maternal galleries (from 40.5 to 44.8 mm), population growth rate (PGR; from 0.7 to 3.6), and emerged adults per m(2) (from 669 to 1,570 insects/m(2)) varied among populations and were negatively correlated with bark colonisation density. Pheromone traps set up in the three investigated forests differed in the number of trapped beetles, with mean captures ranging between 5,310 and 19,850 insects per trap. The populations giving the highest captures in the traps showed the lowest bark colonisation density (248 vs. 489 maternal galleries per m(2)) and the best breeding performance. The populations of parasitoids and predators corresponded to just 1-9 and 2-10% of the emerging I. typographus adults, respectively, and phloem temperature never reached thresholds lethal to I. typographus. Interspecific competition was negligible, whereas intraspecific competition was found to be the main factor affecting the breeding performance of the second generation, although with different intensity according to the colonisation density. It is hypothesised that competition with the first generation and spring precipitation influence the number of suitable hosts available to the second generation.","[Faccoli, Massimo] Univ Padua, Dept Environm Agron & Crop Prod, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy; [Bernardinelli, Iris] Univ Udine, Dept Biol, I-33100 Udine, Italy","Faccoli, M (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Environm Agron & Crop Prod, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy.",massimo.faccoli@unipd.it,"Faccoli, Massimo/AAC-8141-2020",,"Direzione Centrale delle Risorse Agricole, Naturali, Forestali e della Montagna-Regione Autonoma Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Italy); PRIN projectMinistry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN) [200774ENMR]","The authors would like to thank Fabio Stergulc, Olle Anderbrant, Andrea Battisti, Marc Kenis and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments on earlier versions of the manuscript, and to Alison Garside for linguistic proofreading.

Previous study has revealed that 74.7 % of genetic variability occurs among populations in Yunnan, indicating a mixed mating system for the species. The large floral display also indicates high potential geitonogamy. Therefore, plant density and display size may be important factors influencing the realized mating system of P. rex. In the study reported here we explored the effects of plant density and floral display size on pollinator movements and thus outcrossing rate in two patches of in P. rex at low and high plant densities. We examined foraging behavior of bumblebees, measured reproductive outputs under hand and natural pollination, and estimated the outcrossing rates using RAPD markers. Floral display size was significantly larger and bumblebees visited significantly more flowers in sequence on individual plants in the sparse patch than in the dense patch. We found a significant positive correlation between floral display size and successive visits in the sparse patch, but not in the dense patch. Regression analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation between fruit production and flower production per plant with a theoretical maximum of 63 fruits per plant, but no relationship between seed production and flower production per plant. Contrary to previous studies on genetic structure, however, we found an unexpectedly high outcrossing rate in both the sparse and the dense patch (t (m) = 1.151 and 0.924, respectively). Resource limitation may intensify seed competition and result in selected seed abortion, which may largely explain the unexpectedly high outcrossing rate.","[Jing, Xia; Hong, Liu; Rui, Qin] S Cent Univ Nationalities, Engn Res Ctr, Coll Life Sci, Protect & Utilizat Bioresource Ethn Area So China, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China","Jing, X (corresponding author), S Cent Univ Nationalities, Engn Res Ctr, Coll Life Sci, Protect & Utilizat Bioresource Ethn Area So China, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",meir_xj@whu.edu.cn,"Xia, Jing/B-2794-2012","Xia, Jing/0000-0003-4762-2053",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30900127],"We thank K.

To elucidate how small populations evolve in high-competition, low-predation environments, we examined differences in morphological characteristics, tail autotomy rates, and home range sizes in several populations of Aegean Wall Lizards (Podarcis erhardii; Lacertidae) living on one large-island site and three small-islet sites. While there was relatively little consistent morphological divergence between the study populations, we did observe significantly higher rates of shed and regenerated tails on predator-free, small-island sites, a counter-intuitive pattern for a known antipredator defense. Rather than a sign of failed predation events, this pattern is best explained by the fact that tail-shedding can be precipitated by intraspecilic aggression and tail cannibalism, which are known to be particularly frequent on small islands. We also found that small-island female lizards, but not males, maintained significantly smaller home ranges than large-island females. Our results indicate that differences in prevailing ecological conditions (most likely reduced food availability and relaxed predation pressure) drive distinct changes in tail shedding rates and home range size in these island lizards.","[BeVier, Graham T.; Foufopoulos, Johannes] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Brock, Kinsey M.] Univ Calif, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Life & Environm Sci, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Brock, Kinsey M.] Univ Calif, Quantitat & Syst Biol Grad Program, Merced, CA 95343 USA","BeVier, GT (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",grahambevier@gmail.com,,,University of Michigan Program in the Environment; University of Michigan College of LiteratureUniversity of Michigan System; Arts Honors Program,"This study would not have been possible without financial support from the University of Michigan Program in the Environment, Program in Biology, and Program in Modern Greek, and the University of Michigan College of Literature, Sciences, and the Arts Honors Program.

We addressed questions about the historical patterns of development of these two fields. Have ecology and evolution always formed a coherent body of literature? What dominant ideas have motivated research activity in these two fields? How long have these ideas attracted the attention of researchers? Contrary to what was expected, we did not observe any trend towards a stronger integration of ecology and evolution into one big cluster that would suggest the existence of a single community. Three main bodies of literature have stayed relatively stable over time: population/community ecology, evolutionary ecology, and population/quantitative genetics. Other fields have disappeared, emerged or mutated over time. Besides, research organization has shifted from a taxon-oriented structure to a concept-oriented one over the years, with researchers working on the same topics but on different taxa showing more interactions.","[Reale, Denis; Montiglio, Pierre-Olivier; Gingras, Yves] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, CP8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Khelfaoui, Mahdi] Univ Quebec Montreal, Ctr Interuniv Rech Sci & Technol, CP8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Gingras, Y (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, CP8888,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",gingras.yves@uqam.ca,"Montiglio, Pierre-Olivier/AAE-8219-2020; GIngras, Yves/AAQ-7556-2020; REALE, Denis/AAG-1571-2020","REALE, Denis/0000-0002-0419-7125",Fonds de Recherche Quebec Nature Technologies,"We thank Beatrix Beisner and Pedro Peres-Neto for their constructive comments on a previous draft and Yimen Araya-Ajoye, Anne Charmantier, Niels Dingemanse, and Dave Westneat for discussions on the results.

Spiders of the genera Argiope and Nephila exemplify both cases and are able to adjust their webs to increase foraging success. In this study, I compared the foraging strategies of A. submanorica and N. clavipes as they foraged on the same natural prey (stingless bees). Argiope submanorica adds UV-reflective decorations while N. clavipes builds non-UV-reflective golden webs. Based on studies that suggest a lack of niche separation between these two species, the objective of this study was to test whether this hypothesis holds when the spiders are competing for a limited resource. In addition, I investigated whether the colorations of the spiders influence their foraging success. The golden webs of N. clavipes intercepted more bees than the decorated webs of A. submanorica, suggesting that some type of niche separation must occur in nature, as otherwise competition would lead to the local extinction of A. submanorica. These differences in foraging success, leading to its ability to outcompete other spider species exploiting the same resource, could explain in part the abundance and distribution of the N. clavipes on the American continent.","[Galvez, Dumas] INDICASAT AIP, City Knowledge, Bldg 219,POB 0843-01103, Panama City 5, Panama; [Galvez, Dumas] Univ Panama, Programa Ctr Amer Maestria Entomol Vicerrectoria, Ave Simon Bolivar, Panama City 0824, Panama","Galvez, D (corresponding author), INDICASAT AIP, City Knowledge, Bldg 219,POB 0843-01103, Panama City 5, Panama.; Galvez, D (corresponding author), Univ Panama, Programa Ctr Amer Maestria Entomol Vicerrectoria, Ave Simon Bolivar, Panama City 0824, Panama.",dumas.galvez@mail.com,,,Organization for Tropical Studies,"I thank Carlos Garcia-Robledo, Orlando Vargas, Johel, Chaves, Arietta Fleming-Davies, Claudia Lizana, and Mirjam Knornschild for help during the experiments; Talia Girton for improving the English of the manuscript; David W.

Responses of the nine species from 15 populations spanning North and South America included both UV attraction and UV avoidance, and varied among habitats, species and populations. Copepods from more transparent lakes were more attracted to UV than those from less transparent lakes. When individuals were pre-exposed in the laboratory to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the presence and absence of UV, those pre-exposed to UV spent more time in the high UV environment than those exposed to PAR alone. However, these differences disappeared after 150 min, suggesting that the responses were short term and mediated in part by ambient UV conditions. Copepods represent a large proportion of the biomass of zooplankton in many aquatic ecosystems, and their ability to detect and respond behaviorally to UV may enable them to use this ubiquitous environmental cue to regulate their water column position. The use of UV as a habitat selection cue may permit copepods to exploit optimal food environments or limit overlap with less UV-tolerant competitors, predators or parasites, while minimizing damage resulting from longer term UV exposure.","[Overholt, Erin P.; Rose, Kevin C.; Williamson, Craig E.] Miami Univ, Dept Biol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA; [Fischer, Janet M.] Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Biol, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA; [Cabrol, Nathalie A.] NASA Ames, Seti Inst Carl Sagan Ctr, Ames, CA USA; [Rose, Kevin C.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Biol Sci, Troy, NY USA","Overholt, EP (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Dept Biol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",overhoep@miamioh.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Environmental Biology (DEB)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0734277]; Miami University; Smithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Institution; Franklin and Marshall College; Andrew W.
