Consequent changes in species composition have been proposed but as yet not demonstrated. We conducted competition experiments in which mixed cultures of Antarctic marine diatoms and colonial and flagellate stages in the life cycle of the haptophyte Phaeocystis antarctica were exposed to natural Antarctic solar irradiance. Results demonstrated UVE-induced changes in species composition favouring the colonial stage of P. antarctica following 2 d exposure or less. These data indicate the potential for altered trophodynamics and carbon flux in Antarctic waters as a result of ozone depletion. Our results also show the limited predictive value of results obtained using UVB exposures above those likely to be experienced in the natural environment.,"UNIV TASMANIA,INST ANTARCTIC & SO OCEAN STUDIES,HOBART,TAS 7001,AUSTRALIA","Davidson, AT (corresponding author), AUSTRALIAN ANTARCTIC DIV,CHANNEL HIGHWAY,KINGSTON,TAS 7050,AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,32,58,58,1,2,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0948-3055,,,AQUAT MICROB ECOL,Aquat.

Young-of-the-year and small-sized, sexually mature individuals, ranging 27-45 and 82-110 mm in total length, were recorded in nocturnal trawl catches from pelagic midwater in August. The sculpin had fed extensively on both benthic and semi-pelagic crustaceans, including large cyclopoid copepods, Mysis relicta, Pallasea quadrispinosa, Monoporeia affinis, Gammaracanthus lacustris, and Saduria entomon. Based on an extensive literature review a series of ecological and evolutionary reasons for a pelagic behavior of this profundal coldwater fish is suggested. Nocturnal, semi-pelagic feeding, and consecutive, thermotactic, vertical migrations up in midwater as shown by Wurtsbaugh & Neverman (1988) in order to maximize energy intake after feeding, are possible adaptations of these juvenile sculpin for minimizing size-dependent mortality due to intra- and interspecific predation and competition from other deepwater fishes.","UNIV UPPSALA,SECT ANIM ECOL,DEPT ZOOL,UPPSALA,SWEDEN; UNIV STOCKHOLM,DEPT ZOOL,S-10691 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN","Hammar, J (corresponding author), INST FRESHWATER RES,S-17893 DROTTNINGHOLM,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,69,4,4,0,7,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Whiting in nearshore waters (< 1.5 m) were sampled using a fine-meshed seine net, while those in 'shallow' (5-15 m) and 'deep' (20-35 m) waters of the inner continental shelf were sampled with a trawl net. Shallow nearshore waters are shown to provide nursery habitats for five of the six whiting species. In these waters, Sillaginodes punctata, Sillago burrus, Sillago schomburgkii and Sillago vittata mainly occur in protected areas,while Sillago bassensis predominantly occupies areas that are more exposed to wave and swell activity. The first three of these species also use estuaries as nursery areas. In nearshore waters, whiting were captured almost exclusively over bare sand, rather than in interpersed beds of the seagrass Posidonia spp., presumably reflecting the fact that the dense canopies produced by the wide blades of Posidonia spp. must inhibit penetration by the benthic whiting species. As O + S punctata increase in size, they tend to move offshore during the day and inshore at night. Many mature representatives of S. schomburgkii are present in nearshore areas, whereas the other four species move offshore into inner-shelf waters as they increase in length. Sillago burrus and S. vittata remain in shallow inner-shelf waters, whereas the larger S. bassensis subsequently migrate into deeper inner-shelf waters. Large Sillago bassensis thus co-occurs with Sillago robusta, which is mainly found in those deeper waters, but does not reach as large a size. The larger S punctata occupy areas near reefs which could not be sampled by trawl netting. There are thus interspecific differences in (i) the times of recruitment of the O + age class into nearshore areas, (ii) the types of habitat occupied during juvenile and adult life, and (iii) the degree to which fish move into more offshore waters as they increase in length, and one species is restricted to deeper waters. The resultant partial segregation among habitats of the coastal waters of south-western Australia by different size groups of these relatively abundant whiting species presumably reduces the potential for intra- and interspecific competition amongst these species.","WESTERN AUSTRALIA MARINE RES LABS,N BEACH,WA 6020,AUSTRALIA","Hyndes, GA (corresponding author), MURDOCH UNIV,SCH BIOL & ENVIRONM SCI,MURDOCH,WA 6150,AUSTRALIA.",,"Hyndes, G.a./AAB-6619-2019","Hyndes, G.a./0000-0002-3525-1665",,,,49,52,53,2,18,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Effects of temperature on aspects of behavior, individual growth, development and reproduction, and population dynamics are compared across zooplankton taxa. Thermal responses vary markedly among co-occurring species and among clones within parthenogenetic species. There is strong evidence that elevated temperature can produce a reduction in body size within zooplankton populations. Also, some zooplankton assemblages become increasingly dominated by smaller bodied forms under warm conditions. We hypothesize that certain cold-water zooplankton species show the greatest risk of local extinction during late summer heating events because of their dependence on thermal refugia, and their lack of diapausing or dispersal stages. Indirect effects of elevated temperature mediated by changes in the algal food supply or by altered interspecific interactions are also explored. Elevated temperature can change algal community structure and algal food quality, all of which can affect the outcome of zooplankton interspecific competition. Size-selective predation rates of planktivorous fish are also likely to increase with increasing temperature or when zooplankton are driven from the hypolimnion. The onset of fish feeding is also likely to begin earlier in the season thus reducing the time that large zooplankton are present during the ice-free season. Reductions in the size structure of zooplankton assemblages are likely to alter water clarity, nutrient regeneration and fish abundances.","DARTMOUTH COLL,DEPT BIOL SCI,GILMAN LAB 6044,HANOVER,NH 03755","Moore, MV (corresponding author), WELLESLEY COLL,DEPT BIOL SCI,WELLESLEY,MA 02181, USA.",,,,,,,125,155,164,4,101,E SCHWEIZERBART'SCHE VERLAGS,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0003-9136,,,ARCH HYDROBIOL,Arch.

Adaptive specialization theory relies on the comparative method for testing its hypotheses and assumes a naturally selected basis for the predicted differences. This review examines social learning as a specialization to group-living and scramble feeding competition. It points out one important problem with current studies in the area, the lack of quantitative controls for confounding variables that may cause type 1 or 2 error in comparative tests. A linear regression technique is proposed to measure and remove interspecific differences on control tests for which there is no predicted adaptive specialization; as in other areas of comparative biology, the adaptive prediction is then made on the residual deviation from the regression of these confounding variables.

Although many of these pools become dry during summer and early autumn, they are recolonized by fish from nearby pools that overflow during winter floods. N. balsioni spawns at the end of its first year of life, when, on average, the males and females have reached 60 and 63 mm T.L., respectively, and then usually die within the next few months. The largest fish, which was one of only three in its third year of life, measured 90 mm and weighed 7.3 g. The von Bertalanfly growth curve parameters for L(x) K and t(0) were 71.2 mm, 1.69 and - 0.078 for males and 52.6 mm, 1.31 and - 0.095 for females. Fecundity ranged From 550 to 1600. N. balstoni spawns during the middle of winier, after heavy flooding and when water temperatures are at, or close to, their annual minima. This enables the larvae and young juveniles to capitalize on those aquatic organisms, especially Cladocera, which are very abundant amongst the Aooded riparian vegetation that surrounds the pools in winter and spring. Hence, the fish grow rapidly and attain an appreciable size before summer, when the increases that occur in the densities of the larger carnivorous fish species, as a result of marked declines in water levels, increases the chances of predation. By spring, when most N. balstoni exceed 25 mm T.L., the diet changes markedly to one that consists almost exclusively of terrestrial fauna. In contrast, three of the sis cu-occurring native species of teleost feed on aquatic and terrestrial fauna throughout the year, while a Further two feed only within the water column and the sixth reeds on benthic invertebrates. The pronounced shift in dirt exhibited by N. balstoni as it increases in size, allied to dietary differences amongst the other six co-occurring species, reduces any potential for interspecific competition for food resources during the summer and autumn, when such resources are declining.

We estimated the relative density of several potential prey (all the small mammals and three of the lizard species), and found highly positive relationships between prey availability and prey use by snakes.

The latter predicts that community structure will change during the course of succession, with chance establishment predominating early in succession, and competitive sorting into microhabitats increasing with time. The average strength of positive and negative interspecific associations should therefore increase. There is little evidence available to test these models in real communities. 2 We test the two models using postfire succession in tall tussock grasslands of New Zealand. Twenty-one sites dominated by the tussock grass Chionochloa rigida, and last burnt within the past 30 years, were sampled using contiguous quadrats. Three association coefficients were calculated for each site and related to time since the last fire, presence or absence of grazing, maximum height of vegetation and soil nutrient status. The results were examined at a range of spatial scales. 3 Community structure, as evidenced by the strength of interspecific association at small quadrat sizes, was significantly related to site factors. Mean association was negative in recently burnt sites, and again in sites burnt more than 20 years previously. The trends support the competitive-sorting model over the gradient-in-time model. The results are also compatible with the 'three-phase' model of secondary succession suggested by Greig-Smith; we refer to the three phases as 'pioneer', 'building' and 'mature'. 4 There was a significant tendency over all sites for there to be a constant proportion of species from the graminoid vs. forb + bryophyte + lichen guilds in a quadrat, compared to null-model expectation. This tendency towards guild proportionality was more marked in lower elevation sites, and in sites where there was no grazing. This supports the existence of determinate community structure, a factor explicitly included in the competitive-sorting model. 5 We conclude that there is significant community structure in the tussock grasslands. The changes in species association are affected by grazing and site quality. The strength of species association can be an index of changes in community structure during succession, in spite of the confounding effect of microsite variation; however, this relationship is affected by grazing and site quality. The competitive-sorting model fits the results more closely than the gradient-in-time model, but the 'three-phase' model gives the best fit.","UNIV OTAGO, DEPT BOT, DUNEDIN, NEW ZEALAND",,,,,,,,42,19,19,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

Population dynamics models show that coagulation has an important impact on species succession during diatom blooms. When different species collide and form mixed aggregates this process causes interspecific interference competition within the diatom community. The outcome can be predicted by a set of simple differential equations. For a two-species system the equations reduce to the Lotka-Volterra two-species competition model. The outcome of this interference competition depends on species-specific growth rates, cell sizes, stickiness and on the species composition of the seeding populations of a bloom. Due to mutual flocculation some species may disappear from the environment. Small and fast growing diatoms are favoured by high stickiness coefficients. The impact of stickiness on species succession was found to be-most pronounced in eutrophic and hydro-graphically isolated environments. The sticking properties of the diatom Skeletonema costatum are discussed in an evolutionary context; we suggest that mutual coagulation increases the abundance of S. costatum relative to other diatom species in coastal areas. The model was tested on field data, and the predicted dynamics of a spring bloom was very similar to that observed.","DANISH INST FISHERIES & MARINE RES,DK-2920 CHARLOTTENLUND,DENMARK","HANSEN, JLS (corresponding author), BIOL MARINE LAB,STRANDPROMENADEN 5,DK-3000 HELSINGOR,DENMARK.",,"Kiorboe, Thomas/G-3190-2011; Kiorboe, Thomas/ABI-4733-2020; Hansen, Jorgen/B-3391-2019","Kiorboe, Thomas/0000-0002-3265-336X; Hansen, Jorgen/0000-0003-3313-7380",,,,38,24,26,0,17,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Five types of sleeping sites were distinguished: 1) Jessenia bataua palms; 2) tree hollows; 3) dense tangles of vegetation; 4) crotches; 5) open horizontal branches. Both tamarin species used Jessenia-palms most frequently. Tree hollows ranked second in the saddle-back tamarins, but were never used by moustached tamarins. Sleeping sites of moustached tamarins were located significantly higher than those of saddle-back tamarins. Jessenia-palms used by moustached tamarins were significantly higher than palms from a random transect sample, but this was not the case for Jessenia-palms used by saddle-back tamarins. For both species, concealment seems to be more important than height above ground. The maximum number of subsequent nights spent in the same sleeping site was two in moustached tamarins and six in saddle-back tamarins. The two tamarin species did not compete for sleeping sites. While the general pattern of sleeping site selection conforms to hypotheses predicting safety from predators as a major factor, differences between the two tamarin species reflect general niche differences between them.

It is suggested that the rate of successional change is partly responsible for the diversity peak early in successional of both the plant and carabid community. For the carabid community microclimatic variability and the lack of community regulating processes, such as interspecific competition and predation, might also contribute to early diversity peaks in succession. A slight increase of diversity after eight years presumably resulted from increased spatial heterogeneity.","NETHERLANDS INST ECOL, CTR ESTUARINE & COASTAL ECOL, 4401 EA YERSEKE, NETHERLANDS",,,,,,,,53,12,14,1,8,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",0031-4056,,,PEDOBIOLOGIA,Pedobiologia,OCT,1995,39,5,,,,,405,416,,,,,12,Ecology; Soil Science,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture,TB135,WOS:A1995TB13500002,,,,,2021-09-21,

Samples were taken in three different types of habitat, an artificial reef (AR) site, a natural reef (NR) site, and sandy-mud bottom (SE) site, from May 1987 to September 1998, mostly every two months. A total of 67 prey items were recognized in the stomachs of 45 predator fish species. The most important preys were the pelagic fishes Sardinops melanostictus and Engraulis japonicus, which comprised 37% wet wt of the overall stomach contents. The percentage of pelagic fishes was highest at AR site, where fish density was highest. The dominant ten species could be divided into five feeding types. The pelagic fish feeders Physiculus maximowiczi and Gadus macrocephalus fed mainly on S. melanostictus. The dietary breadth of P. maximowiczi was wide, while that of Gadus macrocephalus was narrow. The pelagic crustacean feeder Theragra chalcogramma mostly consumed Themisto japonica and euphausiids and showed the least dietary overlap with other fishes. Benthic fish feeders were Hemitripterus villosus and Liparis tanakai. The benthic crustacean feeders Alcichthys alcicornis and Hexagrammos otakii consumed benthic crustaceans as well as pelagic and benthic fishes and showed the largest dietary breadth. The benthic invertebrate feeders Gymnocanthus intermedius. Dexistes rikuzenius and Tanakius kitaharai fed mainly on polychaetes and benthic crustaceans. But Gymnocanthus intermedius consumed a significant proportion of pelagic fishes. Ontogenetic dietary shift was recognized for these fishes. Pelagic fishes were consumed more intensively by larger individuals, especially true of A. alcicornis, Theragra chalcogramma and Gadus macrocephalus. Predominancy of the two most abundant species, P. maximowiczi and A. alcicornis, may be supported by their wide dietary breadth and the significant proportion of pelagic fish in their diets. Interspecific dietary overlap was low in most cases suggesting that food resources were well partitioned, although some high overlap was observed among the pelagic fish feeders, A. alcicornis, and Gymnocanthus intermedius, and among the benthic invertebrate feeders. Interspecific competition seemed more likely in the benthic invertebrate feeders than in the pelagic fish feeders partly because of superabundance of the pelagic prey S. melanostictus.","TOHOKU NATL FISHERIES RES INST,SHIOGAMA,MIYAGI 985,JAPAN; MIYAKO REG DEV BUR IWATE PREFECTURAL GOVT,MIYAKO,IWATE 027,JAPAN; TOHOKU NATL FISHERIES RES INST,HACHINOHE,MIYAGI 031,JAPAN; IWATE FISHERIES TECHNOL CTR,KAMAISHI,IWATE 026,JAPAN","FUJITA, T (corresponding author), MUSEUM NAT SCI,SHINJUKU KU,HYAKUNIN CHO 3-23-1,TOKYO 169,JAPAN.",,,,,,,54,35,42,0,10,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

To help explain disparity in species-specific responses to growing-season length, we examined the developmental phenology and distribution of each species in relation to natural snow depth variation. Season length varies from approximate to 50 d on early-melting edges of the snowbed to 35 d in the late-melting center, 100 m away. By experimentally altering snowpack, we uncoupled the relationship between spatial location and snowmelt schedule in three consecutive years, imposing the same early dates of snow release in a ''long growing-season'' treatment and the same late dates of snow release in a ''short growing-season'' treatment near the edge and center of the snowbed. Over the course of the experiment, growing-season length had significant effects on absolute and relative cover of the species studied (P < 0.025 and P < 0.005, respectively), and these effects were similar near both the edge and center of the snowbed. Yet, only for the snowbed specialist, Sibbaldia procumbens, were changes in absolute and relative cover under early and late snowmelt schedules predictable from the species' distribution along the historical snow depth gradient. S. procumbens increased in cover under a long growing-season and was more common in historically early-melting portions of the snowbed. Other species (e.g., Ranunculus adoneus, Artemisia scopulorum) were equally common in historically early- and late-melting locations within the snowbed, but showed discordant responses to experimentally imposed changes in snowmelt schedule. That the cover of many species under long- vs, short growing seasons was not predictable from their current distributional affinities in relation to snowmelt pattern likely reflects the disparity between the rates of processes exerting long-term control on species' abundances (colonization, soil development) and more immediate effects of growing-season length on plant growth. Consistent with this view, differences in developmental phenology better predicted species-specific responses to snowmelt schedule than distributional affinities. Species having leaf expansion schedules that are poorly synchronized with snowmelt typically had similar cover under early vs. late schedules of snow release (Geum rossii, Trifolium parryi, and Poa alpina). In contrast, species in which leaf expansion schedules are synchronized with snowmelt responded positively to early snow release (Ranunculus adoneus and Sibbaldia procumbens). We hypothesize that maintaining metabolic ''readiness'' under snowcover provides a mechanism for monopolizing nutrient flushes and competitor-free intervals at snowmelt, and exploiting occasional long intervals for growth in years of little snow accumulation, but incurs a respiratory cost that is manifest as reduced growth and vegetative cover when snowmelt is delayed. Our results suggest that interspecific differences in growth phenology of coexisting species will promote shifts in snowbed plant communities with climate change within generations.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS, DEPT BOT, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA; UNIV CALIF DAVIS, CTR POPULAT BIOL, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA","GALEN, C (corresponding author), UNIV MISSOURI, DIV BIOL SCI, COLUMBIA, MO 65211 USA.",,"Stanton, Maureen L/E-1204-2012",,,,,40,121,126,2,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1995,76,5,,,,,1546,1557,,10.2307/1938156,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RE892,WOS:A1995RE89200016,,,,,2021-09-21,

During the growing season of 1990, plots with average densities of 10-11 grasshoppers per m(2) were treated with carbaryl bran bait (carbaryl plots) or bran bait without carbaryl (control plots). The grasshoppers fed particularly heavily on alfalfa, driving the percent cover of this species to essentially zero by mid-August. Application of carbaryl significantly reduced the densities of three of the four major grasshopper species present (Oedaleonotus enigma, Melanoplus sanguinipes, and M. packardii),and slowed the rate with which these insects consumed the standing crop of alfalfa. In contrast, densities of the fourth major grasshopper species present, M. bivittatus, were not reduced by application of carbaryl but instead were greatly elevated. This population response may have arisen in large part as adults of M. bivittatus aggregated in carbaryl plots in response to the reduced rate of defoliation of alfalfa by other species. Greater numbers of M. bivittatus nymphs also occurred in 1991 in plots treated with versus without carbaryl in 1990 (no carbaryl was applied in 1991), as did greater numbers of O. enigma nymphs (despite there having been fewer adult females present in these plots the previous year). But the densities of grasshoppers of all species were low in all plots in 1991 (approximately 1 per m(2) by mid-summer), and no differences in percent cover of alfalfa or other Vegetation were detected in plots treated the previous year with versus without carbaryl. The striking positive response of M. bivittatus to application of carbaryl bran (and associated reductions in population sizes of competing grasshopper species) strongly suggests that intense interspecific interactions occurred at the study site in 1990.",,"EVANS, EW (corresponding author), UTAH STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA.",,,,,,,33,3,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,1995,73,1,,,,,73,78,,10.2307/3545727,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RH161,WOS:A1995RH16100010,,,,,2021-09-21,

Comparison of Paleogene mammalian faunas from the Bighorn, Clarks Fork, and Crazy Mountains basins of Wyoming and Montana with Neogene mammalian faunas from the Siwalik Group of northern Pakistan reveals similarities and differences in patterns of size change through intervals of 10 m.y. Two approaches to size change are presented. The first is to evaluate changes in the size distribution of faunas over three time intervals in each sequence. Rank-ordered size distributions, or cenograms, are used to depict faunal size structure for non-carnivorous species. The slopes and gaps in different regions of the size spectrum reflect conditions of vegetation and climate, by analogy with modern mammalian faunas (Legendre, 1986, 1989). For the Paleogene and Neogene faunas, subtle changes over time in size structure reflect changes in local vegetation and climate. The Paleogene cenograms suggest a habitat shift from mesic to humid forest, and the Neogene cenograms suggest a shift from open woodland to savannah scrub. These interpretations are supported by concurrent changes in trophic structure, faunal turnover, and in floral and geologic indicators. The second approach focuses on size change within species and lineages in several families of predominantly herbivorous species. For 60 Paleogene species and 39 Neogene species, change in average species size over successive biostratigraphic intervals is assessed by a criterion of doubling or halving of body mass relative to the preceding interval. New occurrences are compared to established species of the same genus and of the same family. In both records, size increases occur slightly more often than size decreases. The size distribution of groups changes more often through appearances of species of more than double or less than half the size of established species of the same group or by disappearances, rather than through rapid change of size within species. The pattern of change in median size and size range of contemporaneous species varies among families in both records. Three causes of evolutionary size change-climatic change, competition, and predation-are evaluated. In both records, climatic change and interspecific competition are considered the principle mechanisms for the observed changes.","UNIV MICHIGAN, MUSEUM PALEONTOL, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA; UNIV TEXAS, DEPT ANTHROPOL, AUSTIN, TX 78712 USA; DUKE UNIV, MED CTR, DEPT BIOL ANTHROPOL & ANAT, DURHAM, NC 27710 USA","MORGAN, ME (corresponding author), HARVARD UNIV, DEPT ANTHROPOL, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA.",,"Gingerich, Philip D/A-6903-2008","Gingerich, Philip D/0000-0002-1550-2674",,,,94,36,36,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0031-0182,1872-616X,,PALAEOGEOGR PALAEOCL,Paleogeogr.

Hence the object of the hypothesis is not individual living organisms but the whole ecosystem. In this paper we use two types of ecosystem models to show how the MRH works in ecosystems. The first is a simple theoretical model that consists of two compartments: a producer and a decomposer. The main results of this first model are as follows. (1) The model presents the community structure which is consistent with the MRH. (2) The dual solution (respiration values) presents the scarcities of different types of matter and energy in an ecosystem with maximal respiration. They operate as similar indicators to the inverse of buffer capacity. (3) The model, when extended to include two types of decomposers, can show the conditions of the coexistence and the competitive exclusion of components. Even if two biological components are strongly overlapping in their ecological niches, a slight differentiation of the ratio of matter exchanges can permit the coexistence. The competition and the coexistence are regulated by the imperative shown by the MRH. The second model is a simulation model for a hypothetical grassland ecosystem which consists of 19 biological components, and 15 kinds of matter and energy. The model includes a grazer system and a decomposer system. The main results are as follows. (1) The ecosystem configuration for biomass production, consumption, egestion, nutrient production, and respiration is presented under the MRH. It especially shows the dominance of the decomposer system. (2) Interspecific substitution guided by respiration values cause an increase in community respiration. If an inferior component undergoes a mutation to increase its production of net respiration value, the component may dominate its competitor and contribute to the increase in the community respiration. This means that the MRH can predict the working of natural selection from the macroscopic point of view.",,"WASHIDA, T (corresponding author), WAKAYAMA UNIV,FAC ECON,930 SAKAEDANI,WAKAYAMA 640,JAPAN.",,,,,,,33,5,7,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

In this article, the evolutionary dynamics of both intra- and interspecific parasitism are analyzed by using a quantitative genetic model. The birds were assumed to be capable of laying their eggs in the nests of either the same or a different species and to evolve to the optimal rates of intra- and interspecific parasitization. Four traits are considered in the model: recognition ability for conspecific eggs, clutch size, total parasitization rate, and interspecific parasitization rate, The model includes five predictions. First, the original form of nest parasitism is likely to be intraspecific. Second, nest parasitism of either type can evolve only when the cost of intraspecific parasitism is smaller than that of competition among offspring in a nest. Third, interspecific nest parasitism should evolve when the costs of both inter- and intraspecific parasitism are small. Fourth, if the marginal decline in survival rate of parasitic eggs in the nests of a different species per unit increase in egg number is greater than the cost of interspecific parasitism, two-species parasitism, in which birds lay eggs in nests of both the same and a different species, should evolve. Finally, if the marginal decline in survival rate is smaller than the cost of interspecific parasitism, complete interspecific nest parasitism should evolve, in which all eggs are laid in the nests of a different species.","KYUSHU UNIV, FAC SCI, DEPT BIOL, FUKUOKA 812, JAPAN",,,"Yamauchi, Atsushi/P-9905-2018","Yamauchi, Atsushi/0000-0002-8463-3491",,,,36,39,41,0,14,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Tundra vole and singing vole populations were negatively associated, probably because of their very different habitat preferences. At low densities, experimental manipulation of food, cover and competing species on the same 18 grids revealed different effects on the arvicoline species. Abundance of tundra voles increased with supplemental food, but singing voles and collared lemmings showed no significant responses. Singing vole populations had a clear negative response, but tundra voles and collared lemmings had no significant response to removal of shrub cover. Similarly, collared lemmings showed no response to removal of tundra voles or singing voles, and tundra voles showed no response to removal of singing voles, but singing voles showed a negative response to removal of tundra voles. The apparent mutualistic relationship between tundra voles and singing voles probably resulted from an indirect effect via predation, i.e., more predation on singing voles when tundra voles were removed.

Huia) have been evaluated in a 30-year experiment (1964-93) based on sown, well-fertilised pasture. Plant species presence was measured each year as basal cover using a vertical 10-pin frame. Hits at ground level from 800 points/plot were recorded in late September on duplicate plots, which were set-stocked at 3 rates (10, 20 reduced to 15, 30 reduced to 20 d.s.e./ha). A soil-water model based on rainfall and tank evaporation was calibrated against on-site soil water measurements (0-260 mm) and used to predict soil water (mm) for weekly time steps over 30 years. Smoothing of long-term rainfall data (SYSTAT, Lowess) showed an overall decline in warm-season rainfall (October-March), which was punctuated by above-average (1969-74) and average runs of years (1983-90). Flexible smoothing splines (SAS) were used to indicate patterns of yearly white clover presence. For all stocking treatments, there were significant declines in the presence of white clover over 3 decades. At the highest stocking rate, the recovery of white clover following the 1965 drought was poor. Late summer (January-March) moisture stress, defined as the number of weeks when soil water (0-260 mm) was <15 mm, was critical in determining white clover presence in the following spring (September). Rainfall received from October to December generally had a positive effect. These climate-based relationships reinforce the importance of stolen growth and survival as a regenerative strategy for white clover. However, over the 30 years, the species showed decreasing resilience post drought, which suggests a long-term failure of seed-based regeneration. Annual rates of soil nitrogen build-up ranged from 29 to 54 kg N/ha.year and were poorly related to white clover presence in the stocking treatments.

There was a seasonal change in their hunting strategy, which involved a switch between hunting mammals in summer and birds in winter. When hunting mammals owls acted as sit-and-wait predators, remaining perched for long periods and quite close to the ground. Hunting for avian prey was characterised by shorter perching times on higher perches in the trees. Pygmy owls attack from above, and predation risk for avian prey appears to be greater in the exterior and lower parts of a tree. This relative predation risk within the tree is of importance in interspecific competition for foraging sites in tits. Interspecific niche separation is likely to affect not only the access to food but the exposure to predation as well. The exposure gradient may be of importance for adaptations balancing the risk of predation and starvation.",,"KULLBERG, C (corresponding author), UNIV STOCKHOLM,DEPT ZOOL,S-10691 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,0,52,53,0,22,FINNISH ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC,HELSINKI,"P.RAUTATIEKATU 13, SF-00100 HELSINKI, FINLAND",0030-5685,,,ORNIS FENNICA,Ornis Fenn.,,1995,72,2,,,,,72,78,,,,,7,Ornithology,Zoology,RP532,WOS:A1995RP53200003,,,,,2021-09-21,

The main birth season was from May to August. The mean duration of lactation was 29 weeks. The duration of lactation for multiparous females that bred twice in a year was significantly shorter than that of multiparous single breeders. In general the young left the pouch during early spring and were fully weaned by the early summer months. In contrast to populations of P. peregrinus inhabiting similar woodland in Victoria only a few multiparous females (6-9%) gave birth to a second litter in the spring/summer months on Flinders Island. The mean litter size (1.84) and annual fecundity, of the population (1.91 offspring per female) were lower than those reported for three populations of Pseudocheirus peregrinus in Victoria. It is suggested that the low occurrence of spring/summer births and low fecundity of P. p. viverrinus on Flinders Island may be related to the age and nutrient status of their coastal teatree forest habitat. The body mass of P. p. viverrinus was higher than previously recorded for P. peregrinus. The adult body mass of females ranged from 948 to 1082 g. Adults showed seasonal variation in body mass with most females losing weight during the late spring and summer months coincident with late lactation. It is proposed that the larger body size of P. p. viverrinus on Flinders Island is a result of release from predation pressure and/or interspecific competition.","UNIV TASMANIA,DEPT ZOOL,SANDY BAY,TAS 7005,AUSTRALIA",,,,,,,,45,10,12,0,3,C S I R O PUBLICATIONS,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",1035-3712,,,WILDLIFE RES,Wildl.

As a whole, the community was characterized by a low density of individuals, with coprophagous beetles largely dominant over carnivorous beetles, both with regard to species richness and abundance. Dung beetles showed the lowest values of species richness and diversity during August a time when predatory beetles peaked. It is possible that during the dry season droppings become a refuge habitat for predatory beetles, as a consequence of moisture and prey availability. With regard to core species (abundance equal to or higher than 20), some intergeneric differences were found. Onthophagus species mainly occurred during May and June, whereas Aphodius species were more diversified, with some mainly occurring during May and June, some during September, and others during July. Most species arrived at the pads during the first two-four days. Aphodius species, however, were still arriving after five-six days, whereas Onthophagus species virtually stopped arriving after the third day. These differences between Aphodiidae and Scarabaeidae were not enough to produce any effective temporal resource partitioning. In fact, both Principal Component Analysis and a Cluster Analysis showed that only dominant species and some core species were temporally segregated from the others. Most species largely overlapped both in time of arrival at the dropping and in their seasonal distribution. The low population density suggests that intra- and interspecific competitive interactions were unlikely to occur in the area during the study period. Also, we doubt that past competition should be invoked to explain the few differences observed. That competition may not be a major organizing factor is also indicated by the similar phenologies of the core dweller species all over Europe.",,"PALESTRINI, C (corresponding author), UNIV TURIN,DIPARTIMENTO BIOL ANIM,VIA ACCADEMIA ALBERTINA 17,I-10123 TURIN,ITALY.",,,"ROLANDO, Antonio/0000-0002-3432-1780",,,,0,9,11,0,4,UNIONE ZOOL ITAL,PADUA,"IST BIOL ANIMALE VIA LOREDAN 10, 35131 PADUA, ITALY",0373-4137,,,B ZOOL,Boll.

This common, sedentary species is found in several discrete areas of the humid Andes separated by distances of hundreds of kilometers, yet the gaps contain seemingly suitable habitat. Mapping of 906 specimen localities by both latitude and elevation shows that these gaps are filled by populations of other Atlapetes species, especially A. tricolor and A. schistaceus (a gray-plumaged species currently thought to be only distantly related to rufinucha, a species with yellow-and-green plumage), which in turn also show complementary, patchy distributions. Where rufinucha is the only species found, it occupies the entire elevational gradient. Where two or more species occur, their elevational distributions are restricted and often complementary. We attribute these patterns to interspecific competition. Hypothetical reconstructions of the sequence of historical events that would generate such a checkerboard distribution pattern in these sedentary taxa are complex. A novel hypothesis that would greatly simplify historical reconstructions is that rufinucha, schistaceus, and perhaps tricolor refer only to recurring color patterns characterized by differing amounts of pigment in the feathers and, therefore, adjacent populations (regardless of current taxonomic designation) are more closely related than either is to more distant populations of the same ''species.'' Therefore, rufinucha and schistaceus populations would be merely allopatric forms of the same lineage that alternate in color pattern (yellow or gray) between adjacent populations, as known for three other lineages of Andean birds. We found limited support for such a hypothesis. Even if rufinucha and schistaceus are distinct species, we predict that they are much more closely related than currently believed and that they differ primarily in pigment concentration. The dramatic differences in phenotype created by differences in pigment concentration in the plumage may frequently cause problems for phenotype-based taxonomic hypotheses.",,"Remsen, JV (corresponding author), LOUISIANA STATE UNIV, MUSEUM NAT SCI, BATON ROUGE, LA 70803 USA.",,,,,,,43,28,32,0,9,AMER ORNITHOLOGISTS UNION,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0004-8038,1938-4254,,AUK,AUK,JAN,1995,112,1,,,,,210,224,,10.2307/4088780,,,15,Ornithology,Zoology,TW753,WOS:A1995TW75300019,,,,,2021-09-21,

We examined populations of two species of Anolis lizards that evolved in the species-rich communities of Cuba and are now widespread in the Bahamas. Because the species occupy islands in the Bahamas that vary in the number of lizard species present and other characteristics, we predicted that directional selection should have led to morphological differentiation. In particular, we expected that populations on one-species islands should have evolved toward a generalist morphology because of the lack of competitors. Divergence in both species has been adaptive; populations that use wider perches have longer legs. Nonetheless, these differences are relatively minor, and none of the populations appears to have differentiated from its ancestral ''ecomorph'' type toward a more generalized morphology. This stasis mirrors a trend observed in the radiation of Caribbean anoles, which exhibits repeated instances of evolutionary specialization, but few or no cases of reversion to a more generalized condition. The explanation for this directionality of evolution is not obvious but probably involves the tendency of specialized species to continue using and further adapting the niches for which they are specialized even as conditions change.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS, EVOLUT & ECOL SECT, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA; UNIV CALIF DAVIS, CTR POPULAT BIOL, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA","LOSOS, JB (corresponding author), WASHINGTON UNIV, DEPT BIOL, CAMPUS BOX 1137, ST LOUIS, MO 63130 USA.",,,,,,,101,89,91,0,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0014-3820,,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,DEC,1994,48,6,,,,,1786,1798,,10.2307/2410508,,,13,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,RA377,WOS:A1994RA37700004,28565160,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

Maximum capture frequency for buried specimens occurred in January, whilst most of the specimens active on the surface were caught during the summer. A total of 14 species was collected, and their annual distribution and mean zonation were analysed using capture frequencies. For the most abundant species, the hourly mean zonation, the daily activity rhythm and the hourly mean activity for each month, were also analysed. Because of the small size of the sandy beach, and the large number of individuals and species present, a spatial and temporal subdivision is necessary to limit interspecific competition.

For sore, abundance was positively correlated with the temperature in the spawning period (April and May), For flounder, abundance was negatively correlated with average temperature during the previous year. For dab, average winter temperature over the spawning period was negatively correlated with juvenile abundance and with mean length observed during the following autumn. These climatic changes were also found to influence the abundance of a large number of other fish and crustacean species which were potential predators or competitors and which in some cases were significantly correlated with flatfish abundance. The data set was analysed using multiple correlation analysis, Multi-factorial models of population change which included interspecific and climatic factors were examined. Using first-order partial correlations it was possible to distinguish between different causal models.

A survey of twenty years of the published literature reveals that in general, niche overlap in co-occurring small insectivorous mammals is lowest at high latitudes.

Only five potential instances of character displacement in teleosts are cited in the conceptually oriented literature, whereas data exist for 97 species comprising 52 genera and 17 families. We review these studies, focusing on lacustrine species, and draw the following conclusions. First, competition is frequently a diversifying force that creates differences between species (character displacement) and differences within species (character release) when other closely related species are absent. Second, differentiation in lakes occurs along predictable pathways and almost always includes pelagic and benthic forms. The lake environment can therefore be viewed as a set of non-Hutchinsonian or ''environmental'' niches that exist apart from the species that occupy them. Third, a traditional criterion for demonstrating character displacement has been that phenotypic differences between populations in sympatry and allopatry should have a genetic basis. Although this criterion is frequently met in freshwater fish, it is not necessary because phenotypic plasticity can itself be an evolutionary consequence of competition. Finally, in the conceptually oriented literature, the evolutionary consequences of predation are well accepted, but the evolutionary consequences of competition are regarded more skeptically. This skepticism is unwarranted for freshwater fish, whose evolution is clearly influenced by both predators and competitors.",,"ROBINSON, BW (corresponding author), SUNY BINGHAMTON, DEPT BIOL SCI, BINGHAMTON, NY 13902 USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

The limited migration pattern, together with a staggered distribution of the different species and stages above the pycnocline, has been interpreted as a space partitioning mechanism to prevent intra- and interspecific competition.",,"DURO, A (corresponding author), CSIC, INST CIENCIAS MAR, PASSEIG JOAN BORBO S-N, E-08039 BARCELONA, SPAIN.",,"Andreu, Pilar/B-5615-2015","Andreu, Pilar/0000-0002-0912-0231",,,,50,13,13,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-7873,1464-3774,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

Species may not occupy otherwise suitable habitat because of internal (predation, interspecific competition, disease) or external (adverse climate, exploitation, disturbance, impact of exotic species, pollution and toxicants) factors. Historical impacts may persist for many years, and may require active restoration. Forest management plans must consider population data on a metapopulation scale. Data for common species can be at the reconnaissance level whereas for threatened or sensitive species they need to be more detailed.

Since the toxicity of benzene probably results from oxidative metabolites, an understanding of the profile of biotransformation of low levels of benzene is critical in making a valid risk assessment. To that end, we have investigated metabolism of a low concentration of [C-14]benzene (3.4 mu M) by microsomes from human, mouse and rat liver, The extent of phase I benzene metabolism by microsomal preparations from 10 human liver samples and single microsomal preparations from both mice and rats was then related to measured activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1. Measured CYP 2E1 activities, as determined by hydroxylation of p-nitrophenol, varied 13-fold (0.253-3.266 nmol/min/mg) for human samples. The fraction of benzene metabolized in 16 min ranged from 10% to 59%. Also at 16 min, significant amounts of oxidative metabolites were formed. Phenol was the main metabolite formed by all but two human microsomal preparations. In those samples, both of which had high CYP 2E1 activity, hydroquinone was the major metabolite formed. Both hydroquinone and catechol formation showed a direct correlation with CYP 2E1 activity over the range of activities present. A simulation model was developed based on a mechanism of competitive inhibition between benzene and its oxidized metabolites, and was fit to time-course data for three human liver preparations. Model. calculations for initial rates of benzene metabolism ranging from 0.344 to 4.442 nmol/mg/min are directly proportional to measured CYP 2E1 activities. The model predicted the dependence of benzene metabolism on the measured CYP 2E1 activity in human liver samples, as well as in mouse and rat liver samples. These results suggest that differences in measured hepatic CYP 2E1 activity may be a major factor contributing to both interindividual and interspecies variations in hepatic metabolism of benzene. Validation of this system in vivo should lead to more accurate assessment of the risk of benzene's toxicity following low-level exposure.",,"SEATON, MJ (corresponding author), CHEM IND INST TOXICOL,POB 12137,RES TRIANGLE PK,NC 27709, USA.",,,"Schlosser, Paul/0000-0002-9699-9108",,,,43,90,93,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM,OXFORD,"WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP",0143-3334,,,CARCINOGENESIS,Carcinogenesis,SEP,1994,15,9,,,,,1799,1806,,10.1093/carcin/15.9.1799,,,8,Oncology,Oncology,PJ846,WOS:A1994PJ84600006,7923572,,,,2021-09-21,

The high frequency of bioactive components in these primitive filter-feeders is interpreted as chemical defence of sponges against environmental stress factors such as predation, overgrowth by fouling organisms or competition for space. The highest incidence of toxic or deterrent sponge metabolites is consequently found in habitats such as coral reefs that are characterized by intense competition and feeding pressure due, for example, to carnivorous fish. Further support for the adaptive significance of sponge constituents is derived from the observation that sponges which are growing exposed are usually more toxic than those growing unexposed. Whereas the chemical defence of sponges seems to be highly effective against most species of fish, a group of shell-less gastropods, the nudibranchs, has specialized on sponges. While feeding on sponges the nudibranchs sequester the effective chemical armoury of their prey, which is subsequently employed for their own protection. Some nudibranchs, however, have become independent of this interspecific flow of natural products and are able to accumulate defensive compounds through de novo synthesis.",,"PROKSCH, P (corresponding author), UNIV WURZBURG, JULIUS VON SACHS INST BIOWISSENSCH, MITTLERER DALLENBERWEG 64, D-97082 WURZBURG, GERMANY.",,"Proksch, Peter/AAR-4593-2020",,,,,60,141,146,0,42,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0041-0101,,,TOXICON,Toxicon,JUN,1994,32,6,,,,,639,655,,10.1016/0041-0101(94)90334-4,,,17,Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Toxicology,Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Toxicology,NT953,WOS:A1994NT95300001,7940572,,,,2021-09-21,

The modeling approach illustrates how typically complex interspecific interactions which vary with species and shellfish life stage can influence shellfish populations. Model results show the importance of managing shellfish predators, as well as selected groups of fouling species that may function as larval predators or competitors or both with juvenile shellfish life stages. While the modeling approach is limited by the lack of estimating intensities of interspecific interaction, it allows first-order insight into the relative importance of different types of interactions on shellfish populations and which variables are likely to be the most important in affecting shellfish abundance. Coupled with rigorous experimental hypothesis testing, the qualitative modeling approach provides assistance regarding which life stages of a shellfish species or interacting species needs to be managed in order to maximize shellfish productivity.

In human PA, ET-1-induced contraction was competitively antagonized by BQ-123 (an ET(A) receptor antagonist) with a pA(2) value of 7.68. In rabbit PA, however, even a high concentration of BQ-123 (1 mu M) did not affect the contraction. BQ-3020 (an ET(B) receptor agonist) produced potent contraction in rabbit PA but not in human PA. Binding assays of the membrane preparations showed that human and rabbit PAs contained ET(A) and ET(B) receptors in ratios of 93:7 and 23:77, respectively. These results suggest interspecies differences in the ET receptor subtypes that mediate ET-1-induced vasocontraction; ET(A) receptors are dominant in the human PA, whereas ET(B) receptors are dominant in the rabbit PA. Furthermore, the predominance of ET(A) receptors in human PA was supported by autoradiographical studies.

After arrival in October most birds defend territories throughout the winter either as heterosexual pairs or as single birds. In this population we examined: (1) aggressive behaviour of pairs; (2) the functional significance of pair territoriality; and (3) hormonal correlates of territorial behaviour. Pairs were aggressive towards both conspecific intruders and stonechat dummies, particularly in autumn when territories were established. Males were more aggressive than females and aggression was primarily intrasexual. More frequent than intraspecific interactions were interspecific encounters, with 94% involving the local mourning wheatear (Oenanthe lugens). With one exception these encounters consisted of attacks of mourning wheatears against stonechats, mainly males. Two functions of winter territoriality of migrant pairs are proposed: (a) a reduction of individual defense costs associated with the maintenance of a territory; (b) an increase of the net vigilance to reduce the risk of attacks by competitors or predators. The levels of testosterone (males and females) and estradiol (females only) were close to or below the lower detection limit of the assay throughout the winter. Therefore, high levels of gonadal steroids are not required for pair formation and aggression in the non-reproductive context.

I have reviewed the recent primary literature in order to assess quantitatively the frequency of studies of mutualism, the types of questions they address, and their general scientific approach. All articles appearing from 1986 to 1990 in nine major journals that publish ecological and evolutionary research were examined. It is clear that mutualism research is not in fact rare. Studies of interspecific interactions made up about 22% of the over 4500 articles published during this period; of these, about one-quarter investigated some form of mutualism. Over 90% of them investigated plant-animal interactions, primarily pollination (52 %) and seed dispersal (31 %), a bias probably related in part to the particular journals examined. The diversity of questions addressed in these articles was surprisingly low. The majority (63 %) focused simply on identifying the mutualists of some species of interest. Furthermore, almost all studies were unilateral, that is, they focused on only one of the interacting species, plants being studied much more frequently than their animal partners. Mutualism studies do not appear to have focused on mutualism as a form of interaction in the same way as studies of competition and predation. Rather, researchers have treated mutualism primarily as a life history attribute of one of the two partners. Consequently, although an impressive amount of information has accumulated about these interactions, we are still far from achieving an overall picture that transcends the boundaries of particular taxa or combinations of taxa. Three other obstacles have prevented data on mutualisms from being brought together: the historical isolation of studies of different kinds of mutualism, a nearly total disconnection between mutualism theories and empirical studies, and the unilateral approach almost always used to study these bilateral interactions. I identify eight research questions whose answers have the potential to reveal broad-based generalizations about the evolution and ecology of mutualism.",,"BRONSTEIN, JL (corresponding author), UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT BIOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.",,,,,,,171,358,371,6,208,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0033-5770,1539-7718,,Q REV BIOL,Q.

Seven populations of S. longipes were located along an elevational gradient, and fine-scale differentiation between the alpine and prairie forms was quantified genetically and morphologically. Analysis of eight enzyme systems revealed two distinct clusters separating high-elevation populations from low-elevation populations. Morphologically, means and plasticities of traits previously used to describe the tundra ecotype showed parallel population grouping to that of the isozyme analysis. Analysis of environmental parameters showed that growth change and amount of phenotypic plasticity had significant associations with increased wind and temperature stress at high elevations and high interspecific competition at low elevations. This is consistent with the idea that the parallel patterns of separation observed for isozymes, morphology, and plasticity are a result of selection pressures consistent with the C-S-R model. In reciprocal transplants, tundra plants with low plasticity were selected against in a prairie environment. However, no clear advantage was observed for either ecotype in the alpine environment. The high plasticity of the prairie ecotype is likely adaptive for competitive habitats and does not bear a cost of low performance in the unfavorable alpine habitat, as predicted by the specialization hypothesis. The relatively poor performance of the alpine ecotype may reflect a restriction rather than specialization to stressful alpine environments. However, selection for the tundra ecotype in its native habitat may have been detected in experiments carried out over a longer period than those of this study.","UNIV CALGARY, DEPT BIOL SCI, CALGARY T2N 1N4, AB, CANADA; SLIPPERY ROCK UNIV, COLL ARTS & SCI, DEPT BIOL, SLIPPERY ROCK, PA 16057 USA",,,,"Emery, Neil/0000-0003-1304-6430",,,,45,49,49,1,20,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1058-5893,1537-5315,,INT J PLANT SCI,Int.

These questions were pertinent to three hypotheses on the function of habitat selection in antelopes: (i) habitats are chosen to minimize the cost of obtaining resources, (ii) habitat selection results from niche partitioning due to interspecific competition, or (iii) habitat selection functions to avoid predation by using escape terrain and by associating with other species for protection. Results from transects designed to examine preferences for open grassland, Acacia woodlands, Combretum-Terminalia woodland, forests, thickets and rocky habitat types suggested that oribi preferred habitats with rocky outcrops and Combretum-Terminalia woodland. These habitats supported preferred food plant species consistent with hypothesis (i). However, oribi occurred close to rocks in the dry season, and in areas with long grass during the wet season, both of which are used for cover against predators. The significant association of oribi with larger resident ungulates [impala (Aepyceros melampus) and kongoni (Alcelaphus buselaphus)] also suggested that oribi were avoiding predators, consistent with hypothesis (iii). Oribi avoided wildebeest, possibly because of interference, but were randomly associated with topi, zebra and Thomson's gazelle. Preference for plateaux or gentle slopes and green flush agree with studies elsewhere. Major contrasts were shown in the avoidance of open grasslands and Themeda triandra which are reported to be favoured by most oribi populations in South Africa.","UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA, DEPT ZOOL, ECOL GRP, VANCOUVER V6T 1Z4, BC, CANADA",,,,,,,,28,23,24,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-6707,1365-2028,,AFR J ECOL,Afr.

Capsaicin was postulated to exert its pharmacological actions by interacting at a specific recognition site (receptor) expressed predominantly by primary afferent neurons. 2. The actual existence of this long-sought ''capsaicin-receptor'' has recently been demonstrated by the specific binding of [H-3]resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultrapotent capsaicin analog with a unique spectra of actions. 3. Since homovanillic acid is the key structural motif shared by capsaicin and RTX, their recognition site appears to be best termed the vanilloid receptor. 4. Central (sensory ganglia and spinal cord) vanilloid receptors of the rat bind RTX with high affinity in a cooperative fashion; moreover, they recognize capsaicin with higher affinity than the competitive antagonist, capsazepine. Peripheral (urinary bladder, urethra, airways, colon) vaniiloid receptors, by contrast, bind RTX with lower affinity in a noncooperative manner. An opposite affinity for capsazepine relative to capsaicin appears to distinguish vanilloid receptors in the urinary bladder from those present in the airways or colon. These findings imply heterogeneity in the properties of vanilloid receptors. 5. The affinity of [H-3]RTX binding in vitro is influenced by reducing agents, suggesting an in vivo modulatory role for endogenous reducing agents in vanilloid receptor functions. 6. The size of central vanilloid receptors (270 kDa) as measured by radiation inactivation and the cooperative binding both suggest a receptor cluster with cooperating subunits. 7. RTX binds to vanilloid receptors with orders of magnitude higher affinity than capsaicin; its ability to induce cooperative binding is also more pronounced. These differences in receptor binding along with the pharmacokinetical differences in tissue equilibration and in plasma binding may form a rational basis to explain the peculiar spectrum of actions of RTX. 8. Guinea pig spinal cord and airway membranes bind RTX with lower affinity than rat tissues. The receptor density is, however, higher in the guinea pig in keeping with the marked sensitivity of this species to vanilloid actions. 9. The apparently low level of specific [H-3]RTX binding sites in the hamster and rabbit is in accord with the resistance of these species to vanilloid actions. 10. In post-mortem human spinal cord specific [H-3]RTX binding sites can be detected; their binding parameters are similar to those determined in guinea pig spinal cord. 11. The vanilloid receptor appears to display both intraspecies heterogeneity and marked interspecies differences. 12. As yet, it is not known whether the vanilloid receptor is operated by endogenous ligands. It is not known either which receptor superfamily (if any) it belongs to. The [H-3]RTX binding assay has, however, the potential of answering these questions. Thus, rapid progress in our knowledge may be anticipated.","MENARINI RICH SUD, DEPT PHARMACOL, I-00040 POMEZIA, ITALY",,,,,,,,181,186,187,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0306-3623,,,GEN PHARMACOL-VASC S,Gen.

The range and dispersion of alpha-diversity values in the data were significantly higher than in comparable model data sets, indicating varation from favourable to unfavourable conditions for bryophytes at all scales, particularly with increasing cover of the upper layers. The number of positive associations was significantly higher than predicted from a random distribution, for all sample plot sizes except the smallest. For the most frequent species, this number decreased with decreasing sample plot size. The excess of positive associations was due to the presence of (1) a-diversity trends, as demonstrated by a stochastic simulation, and (2) beta-diversity (variation along environmental gradients). A microscale coenocline from dominance of large forest floor mosses to small liverworts, is added to two broad-scale coenoclines demonstrated earlier. Facilitation - positive density-dependence caused by more favourable moisture conditions within dense stands - is discussed as a possible third cause of excess positive associations. The number of significant negative associations was generally low, and deviated neither from theoretical values assuming random distribution of species, nor from predicted values accounting for alpha-diversity trends. The low proportion of negative associations, even in the presence of beta-diversity trends, suggests that interspecific competition is not important in this vegetation. Several alternatives to competition are discussed; (1) static mechanisms for avoidance of competition, (2) mobility, and (3) the importance of density-independent mortality, in particular due to fine-scale disturbance. Simulation studies for assessing the effects of a-diversity trends on species associations are emphasized.",,"OKLAND, RH (corresponding author), UNIV OSLO,BOT GARDEN & MUSEUM,TRONDHEIMSVEIEN 23B,N-0562 OSLO,NORWAY.",,,,,,,0,58,60,0,9,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,KNIVSTA,"APELSINVAGEN 47, S 741 00 KNIVSTA, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

We search for evidence supporting the hypothesis of convergent evolution in morphological and ecological traits and we discuss the role of ecomorphological hypotheses as predictors of foraging differences at the intraspecific level. To overcome the problems introduced by environmental characteristics not related to locomotion and competition, we make observations under controlled situations to manage food quality and food access. We determine that the island Blue Tit has a longer tarsometatarsus, larger foot span and a more proximal insertion of the tibialis cranialis muscle (flexor of the tarsometatarsus) than the mainland Blue Tit. These morphological differences are consistent with the more frequent use of hanging and clinging 'head-up' postures by the Iberian Blue Tit. Several ecomorphological hypotheses obtained at the interspecific level with other taxa, have proved to be of high predictive value for explaining ecological differences considering morphological evolution. The Tenerife Blue Tit and the Iberian Coal Tit clearly show close convergence in both feeding postures and leg structure, although some differences in morphology were found between these two species. Convergence in foraging methods between the island Blue Tit and the mainland Coal Tit can be explained without considering current interspecific competition as a determinant of niche space.","UNIV LA LAGUNA,FAC BIOL,DEPT BIOL ANIM ZOOL,E-238206 TENERIFE,SPAIN","CARRASCAL, LM (corresponding author), CSIC,MUSEO NACL CIENCIAS NAT,DEPT ECOL EVOLUT,JOSE GUTIERREZ ABASCAL 2,E-28006 MADRID,SPAIN.",,"Carrascal, Luis M./B-8381-2008; Moreno, Eulalia/D-4230-2014; valido, alfredo/K-1830-2013; Carrascal, Luis M./Q-2190-2016","Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Moreno, Eulalia/0000-0002-7197-5679; valido, alfredo/0000-0001-8426-8634; Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531",,,,39,25,25,0,15,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0269-7653,,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

The small site on the Kaiserstuhl has the highest species diversity in Scarabaeoidea species of all local dung beetle coenoses described in Europe so far. A comparison of monthly dominance structures of the species community between the Kaiserstuhl and warm temperate pastures in the south of Spain yields similarities on both the subgenus and species levels. Analyses of the phenological distributions of 34 abundant dung beetle species show a high degree of specialisation among all taxonomic and phenologic groups, most prominently among the Aphodius. There are even species which occur predominantly during the winter months, which might be due to low interspecific competition in these months and favourable synchronisation of mating and reproduction. Cluster analysis confirms eight phenological groups and proves the very structuring nature of the niche dimension season. Beside the qualitative separation of species, there was remarkable segregation in the biomass of species in the different months. ''Dwellers'' (endocoprid species) of the subfamily Aphodiinae showed the most pronounced separation, followed by small ''Tunnelers'' (paracoprid species) belonging to the Onthophagus big ''Tunnelers'' of the Copris and Geotrupes and small Hydrophilidae ''Dwellers'' of the genus Cercyon.

The first focused on random sampling in three 9 m2 plots. The second tested distribution inside and outside of the macrophyte root zone at three sites within a lake. The aggregation patterns varied with both taxonomical groups and levels of spatial scale. Chironomids were aggregated in level of samples, particularly when 1 m2 plots were compared but they were randomly distributed at higher spatial levels. Oligochaetes were randomly distributed at lower levels but aggregated among sites. Red chironomids were aggregated at lower levels and randomly distributed among sites. Predatory chironomids were almost uniformly distributed, especially at lower densities. A triangular model was suggested for relating the aggregation patterns to major influencing factors in the community. Taxonomic composition, animal size and number were considered the basic characteristics of a benthic community, and the three relationships among them were suggested to determine the aggregation pattern. According to the model, chironomids were dominated by interspecific competition at lower levels and by environment at higher levels of the spatial scale Oligochaetes were always influenced by environment.

Benthivorous perch (Perca fluviatilis) were stocked over a range of natural densities (no fish, low, and high densities) into enclosures with or without dense submerged vegetation. The biomass of macroinvertebrate prey decreased over time in the presence of perch and was always higher in enclosures with vegetation present than in enclosures lacking vegetation. The increase in mass of perch was positively related to the abundance of macroinvertebrate prey and negatively related to perch density and the density of vegetation. In the treatments lacking vegetation, the proportion of zooplankton in the diet of perch increased, and the growth rate of perch decreased over time. In the vegetation treatments, the proportion of zooplankton in the diet was low throughout the experiment and the growth rate of perch was constant over time. As a consequence, initial increase in mass was considerably higher in the treatments lacking vegetation than in the vegetation treatments, whereas no such pattern was observed in the second half of the experiment. In the absence of vegetation, perch are apparently able to forage efficiently, but this may reduce the availability of macroinvertebrate prey to the extent that perch are forced to include less profitable zooplankton prey into their diet. In vegetated habitats, the foraging efficiency of perch is reduced, which possibly prevents over-exploitation of macroinvertebrate prey and consequently may allow for a moderate, but relatively constant, consumption of macroinvertebrates by perch. The density-dependence of growth rates in both vegetated and unvegetated habitats can only partly be explained by resource competition, which suggests the presence of an additional mechanism of density-dependence. In natural lake communities, efficient predation from benthivorous fish should keep the biomass of macroinvertebrate prey in structurally simple habitats below the high levels initially present in my experiment. In these communities, submerged vegetation may be an equally profitable habitat for juvenile perch as are open areas. Through its effects on the feeding efficiencies of juvenile perch and other benthivorous fish, submerged vegetation may affect individual growth rates and the size structure of perch populations, which may contribute to explain differences in fish community structure among lakes differing in submerged vegetation cover.",,"DIEHL, S (corresponding author), UMEA UNIV, DEPT ANIM ECOL, S-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN.",,"Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013; Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051",,,,70,86,87,1,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,1993,67,3,,,,,403,414,,10.2307/3545353,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LN449,WOS:A1993LN44900003,,,,,2021-09-21,

In northern Wisconsin lakes, the introduced crayfish Orconectes rusticus is replacing two ecologically similar resident congeners, O. virilis and O. propinquus. In laboratory experiments, we compared growth and mortality of individually maintained crayfish offered one of five ad libitum diets: invertebrates, macrophytes, dentritus, periphyton or all items combined. Mortality was highest for 0. virilis and lowest for 0. rusticus. Macrophyte diets yielded the highest mortality. All three species grew best on invertebrate and combination diets but grew little or not at all on diets of periphyton, detritus or macrophytes. 0. rusticus and 0. virilis grew more than 0. propinquus. 0. rusticus grew more quickly and/or was better able to survive overall than its congeners. Therefore, 0. rusticus would probably have advantages over 0. virilis and 0. propinquus in competitive interactions, reproductive success and avoiding size-selective fish predation.

Two main aspects were investigated; their ability to find caches they had not made, and their efforts to reduce competition for caches they did make.

The efficacy of the two predatory mites appeared to be strongly affected by various factors (grape variety, presence of macropredators, climatic condition, interspecific competition, phytoseiid strain). The phytoseiid mites Amblyseius aberrans (Oud.) and Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten were released at three different density levels in two vineyards (A, B) infested by Eotetranychus carpini (Oud.). One strain of A. aberrans and two strains of T. pyri were used for the experiments. In vineyard A, Panonychus ulmi (Koch) was recorded in the second and subsequent years of the experiments and became dominant over E. carpini from the third year onwards. The presence of anthocorids in the same vineyard increased the complexity of the system and gave us the possibility of comparing two very different situations. Release of low numbers of A. aberrans gave a satisfactory control of spider mite populations in both vineyards. These results were even obtained on a variety non preferred by phytoseiids (Merlot) and with the continuous presence of anthocorids (vineyard A). After 5 years, A. aberrans was observed in 53 % of the plots in vineyard A and in all plots of the other vineyard (B). Results of experiments in which T pyri was released were similar to those obtained in the experiments with A. aberrans, but only in the first year of the study. In vineyard A, the T pyri populations declined dramatically from the second year onwards; the use of a non-preferred variety (Merlot) and the continuous presence of anthocorids seemed the most important factors causing the decline of predatory mite density. In vineyard B, T pyri was capable of controlling spider mites even in the second year of the experiments. A very low density of macropredators and a preferred grape variety (Raboso) positively affected control. The density of T pyri in vineyard B decreased at the end of the second year because of adverse climatic conditions (high temperatures in combination with a low relative humidity). The decrease of T pyri allowed the displacement of this species by A. aberrans in all plots of vineyard B.

Encounters were brief, and the response of any nudibranch to contact varied, but was generally non-aggressive. Nudibranchs were not displaced from an area within a hydroid colony by heterospecific nudibranchs. The locations of Tergipes, Dendronotus, and Doto were affected by an increased density of conspecifics, but this pattern was inconsistent.

This is noteworthy since these sympatric fish would appear to be adapted to and constrained by similar environmental conditions. In preliminary acute range-finding tests, there were significant overall differences among three species in tolerance to high temperature, low pH, and hyposaline transfer. There were also significant differences between species in median lethal high temperatures (two species) and low pH (five species) at 96 h. The 96 h pH50 in sea water was especially divergent, with Menidia beryllina being the least tolerant (pH50 = 4.62) and Fundulus luciae the most tolerant (pH50 = 3.60). The hierarchy of tolerance among species was not consistent across all abiotic stresses. The growth of Lucania parva or Fundulus heteroclitus was not generally affected by salinities of 3.5-35 ppt or 0-35 ppt, respectively. These results suggest that selective pressures on each species have resulted in different suites of physiological adaptations to resist spatial and/or temporal changes in the abiotic environment. Such differences in tolerance might affect competitive and/or predaceous interactions among these fishes in a varying abiotic environment. The physiological tolerances of each species and the effects of any such differences on the fish assemblage of intertidal marshes need to be studied further.

All adult males and females of three captive forest-living groups served as focal animals for one year. In contrast to many anthropoid primates, social interactions in these lemurs are characterized by predominantly competitive relations among closely related females, with low overall rates of polyadic conflicts. In L. catta, same-sexed dyads and pairs of closely related individuals had higher proximity-corrected frequencies of agonistic interactions than male-female and non-kin dyads. Grooming interactions, on the other hand, occurred significantly more often than expected in male-female pairs and between unrelated animals. The top-ranking male monopolized the majority of male-female interactions. In E. fulvus, neither sex nor kinship had significant effects on the distribution of grooming and agonistic interactions. Unlike L. catta, grooming and conflicts were observed in all dyads, resulting in more complex social relationships. Male-female relationships in E. fulvus were characterized by strong affiliative relations between individual male-female pairs. Social relationships in E. coronatus were generally similar to those in E. fulvus, except for a significant sex effect on the distribution of interactions, but small sample size precluded a final characterization of this rare species. Collectively, these results suggest that there may be intense competition among individual female lemurs for group membership, even among close relatives in the same matriline. Moreover, interspecific contrasts in male-male and intersexual relationships indicate fundamentally different male roles in these species. This study revealed that patterns of agonistic and affinitive interactions are not generally predictable from sexual selection theory and interspecific differences in life histories, indicating a need for more quantitative descriptions of social relationships in diverse taxa to identify other ecological and social determinants of social structure.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27706",,,"Kappeler, Peter/B-6825-2012",,,,,83,60,61,2,61,BLACKWELL WISSENSCHAFTS-VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",0179-1613,,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,FEB,1993,93,2,,,,,125,145,,,,,21,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,KT376,WOS:A1993KT37600004,,,,,2021-09-21,

According to the principle of <<limiting similarity>> this cohabitation should imply an interspecific ecological differentiation. The hypothesis of a niche separation at the trophic level is tested here. The fecal analysis of 300 droppings collected from a zone of sympatry shows a clear interspecific differentiation in diets : M. myotis eats mostly Carabidae (Coleoptera), whereas M. blythii captures essentially Tettigoniidae, Gryllidae and Acrididae (Orthoptera). Because they consume exclusively terrestrial arthropods, M. myotis and M. blythii are typical ground and/or grass gleaning bats. However, despite their narrow niches they are probably not specialized in the predation of only some definite categories of prey. The narrow diets probably reflect the high specialization of their modes of resource exploitation: M. myotis and M. blythii prey upon ground arthropods and they are likely to select for different foraging;g habitats. M. myotis probably prefers wooded feeding grounds (Carabidae) whereas M. blythii exploits herbaceous habitats (Orthoptera). The strong trophic segregation observed in sympatry between M. myotis and M. blythii shows that the interspecific competition is distinctly much weaker than the intraspecific one.

Most of the species occur in relatively small numbers. Only 17 species formed large monospecific stands. The largest number of species (273) was found during the dry phase in disturbed areas on the levees, as for instance in abandoned fields, because of a reduced impact of the flood and high tight intensity. Low numbers were recorded during low water period from the floor of floodplain forest (25) because of insufficient light conditions and from low lying lake beds (26), which were dominated by a few highly adapted species. The following attributes were found to favour the occurrence of herbaceous plants in the Amazon floodplain: resistance of seeds and spores to flooding and dessication; short reproductive cycles; high reproduction rates; high primary production; tolerance of adult plants to flooding and drought; adaptations to waterlevel fluctuations (for example a floating way of life). Short life cycles and high reproduction rates allow the quick colonization of disturbed habitats and the substitution of population losses (r-strategy). This strategy is supported by the elevated nutrient status of the Amazon river floodplain in comparison with the floodplain of the Negro River, where herbaceous plants are scarce. The number of ruderal species and weeds including,a rising number of neophytes is large. The great species diversity is related to great habitat diversity, fertility of sediments and water, predictability of the floodpulse and the reduction of interspecific competition due to the annual set back of the populations by the flooding and drought.

Females begin oestrus-cycling in early spring, following a minimum 3-month winter anoestrous period. By late spring all mature females are in breeding condition. Breeding is continuous through spring, summer and into autumn. Postimplantation loss occurs throughout the breeding season. Late autumn pregnancies may fail. Average litter size is 6-7 but litters as large as 10 have been found. Young born in the latter half of the breeding season attain sexual maturity at a later stage than those born in the early-spring-summer period and do not come into breeding condition until the following spring. Males show a slight cyclical change in testes weight, increasing from a winter minimum to a summer maximum, but are potentially capable of breeding throughout the year. Reproductive seasonality of the female determines breeding behaviour in this isolated subantarctic population of feral house mice. Seasonal reproduction is not well correlated with mean monthly ambient temperature, which varies by only 3-degrees-C over the year. Food availability appears constant throughout the year with little interspecific competition for food or predation on the mice. Reproduction is suppressed over the short-day winter months.

There is significant sexual dimorphism in the Eastern Kingbird: males have longer tails, wing-tips, and bills than females. This perhaps reflects the aerial courtship displays and aggressive territorial defense performed principally by males. There appears to be little difference in size between the sexes. There is no geographic variation in the degree of sexual dimorphism, indicating either that the extent of dimorphism is not influenced by interspecific competition (as predicted by the niche variation hypothesis) or that such competition is not significant for T. tyrannus. Although there is significant geographic variation in both sexes for all variables measured, the amount of this variation is slight and not clearly ordered in a geographic pattern. Eastern Kingbirds, for example, do not seem to show variation that conforms to Bergmann's Rule. In both sexes, there is a northwest-to-east trend of decreasing size for most characters measured, but a posteriori tests delimit few, and broadly overlapping, statistically homogeneous sets.

Diversity was limited to four species (Dugesia(Dugesia)subtentaculata, Polycelis felina, Crenobia alpina and Phagocata vitta), already known from streams and lakes. Planarians were found rarely (only a third of springs contain them), in low-moderate abundance, and any single spring did not harbour more than one species. The distribution of potential predators and preys among the springs sampled was fairly uniform. So, we assume that whereas predation is unlikely to influence triclad distribution, the oligotrophic character of these habitats may explain, through food shortage and ensuing interspecific competition, the presence of a single species in each spring. Besides interspecific competition, the distribution of each species can also be influenced by particular abiotic parameters. Temperature and current velocity appeared to be the dominant factors, the first separating C. alpina from the rest of species, and th second favouring the presence of P. felina in a large set of springs. These factors also seem to determine planarian distribution in streams and rivers. Other environmental factors such as calcium bicarbonated water (for D. subtentaculata) and preference for karst systems (for Phagocata vitta) are of importance. Some peculiarities of distribution, like the scarcity of C. alpina in reophile habitats and the thermal tolerance of Phagocata vitta, may be due both to competition from P. felina and to historical factors in the former and to morphological (presence of pigment) and ecological (epigean habits) features in the latter, respectively. Karyological analyses demonstrated triploidy in all populations of D. subtentaculata, a polyploid origin for C. alpina and the finding in Phagocata vitta of a new polyploid series leading to the highest chromosome number in turbellarians (14n = 238). Furthermore, the basic chromosome number of C. alpina (n = 21) and Phagocata vitta (n = 17) differs from those found in northern European populations (n = 7 in both, respectively). This suggests that under the specific names C. alpina and Phagocata vitta more than one species actually occurs, this being a problem for further studies. Whereas polyploidy has often been related to living in cold, harsh habitats, asexual reproduction has been linked to environments where biotic stress is low. The preeminence of asexual reproduction (by fissiparity) and polyploid forms in freshwater planarians inhabiting the unproductive, biotically unsaturated springs of the central Pyrenees adds new evidence to strengthen such links.","UNIV BARCELONA, FAC BIOL, DEPT GENET, DIAGONAL 645, E-08028 BARCELONA, SPAIN; UNIV BARCELONA, INST INVEST, E-25530 VIELHA, SPAIN; INST PIRENAICO ECOL, E-22700 JACA, SPAIN",,,,,,,,72,20,23,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,OCT-DEC,1992,15,4,,,,,373,384,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.1992.tb00047.x,,,12,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JU665,WOS:A1992JU66500004,,,,,2021-09-21,

The model provides insights into the manner in which self- and pathogen regulation combine in determining the coexistence or otherwise of hosts and the structure of biological communities generally. A number of outcomes are possible: coexistence of both hosts with the pathogen, coexistence of both hosts without the pathogen, the predictable elimination of one host by the other, which then remains with the pathogen, and the elimination of either host by the other, contingent on initial densities. However, whereas without self-regulation coexistence of both hosts with their shared pathogen can only be achieved by the partitioning of enemy-free space, with self-regulation there is a wider range of paths, including coexistence mediated by the hosts' resources (analogous to exploiter-mediated coexistence), coexistence mediated by interspecific transmission, and coexistence arising when elements of these other mechanisms are combined. Also, a more affected, regulated-alone host can eliminate a less affected, nonregulated-alone host, but not vice versa; whereas without self-regulation only the opposite outcome is possible. The incorporation of self-regulation adds a necessary element of realism.","NATL TECH UNIV ATHENS,DEPT MATH,GR-147 ATHENS,GREECE; UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT APPL MATH & THEORET PHYS,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND","BEGON, M (corresponding author), UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND.",,,"Bowers, Roger/0000-0001-8207-297X; Begon, Mike/0000-0003-1715-5327",,,,26,108,113,0,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 S WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

Regardless of its origin, the Tian Mu Shan Ginkgo population is biologically significant by virtue of its long survival in a semi-natural state under conditions of intense interspecific competition. A total of 167 Ginkgos were counted and measured in the 1018 ha Tian Mu Shan Reserve. Many of the trees were growing on disturbance-generated microsites, such as stream banks, steep rocky slopes, and the edges of exposed cliffs. Forty percent of the censused individuals were multitrunked, consisting of at least two trunks greater than 10 cm in diameter at breast height. Most of these secondary trunks originated from root-like basal chichi, that are produced at the base of trees that have experienced damage from soil erosion or other factors. No Ginkgos less than 5 cm in basal diameter were found in the mature forests of Tian Mu Shan. This lack of seedling reproduction is caused by several factors. (1) the lack of sunny microsites suitable for seedling growth, (2) seed collection by people, and (3) seed predation by animals. In the absence of successful seedling establishment, secondary trunk formation from basal chichi is the single most important factor in explaining the long term persistence of Ginkgo on Tian Mu Shan.",,"DELTREDICI, P (corresponding author), HARVARD UNIV,ARNOLD ARBORETUM,125 ARBORWAY,BOSTON,MA 02130, USA.",,,,,,,0,35,41,0,17,BLACKWELL SCIENCE INC,MALDEN,"350 MAIN ST, MALDEN, MA 02148",0888-8892,,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

These effects can be used to predict the outcome of competition at changing resource availabilities. This work is part of a study on the successional sequence in permanent grassland starting after fertilizer application is stopped, but with continued mowing, in order to restore former species-rich communities. This yields a successional sequence which proceeds from grasslands with a high nutrient availability and a closed canopy, to grasslands with a low nutrient availability and an open canopy. If allocation is related to competitive ability, species from the productive stages would be expected to allocate more biomass and nitrogen to leaves, which could make them better competitors for light, while species from the unproductive stages would allocate more biomass to roots, which could make them better nutrient competitors. This study reports on growth, specific leaf area (SLA), vertical display of leaves, and allocation of biomass and nitrogen of six grassland species from this successional sequence at 16 combinations of light and nutrient supply. Species from the poorer successional stages reached a lower final dry weight than species from the richer stages, over all treatment combinations. The experimental design made it possible to test for unique effects of the resource ratio effect of light and nutrients on allocation characteristics. This resource-ratio effect was defined as the ratio light intensity/(light intensity + nutrient supply rate). using standardized levels for the treatments. The within-species variation (plasticity) in both allocation of dry matter ad nitrogen was linearly related to this resource-ratio effect. Some interspecific differences in this relationship were found which could be related to the position of the species along the successional gradient. However, the range of plasticity in allocation pattern expressed within each species was much larger than the differences between species. It was concluded that allocation differences between these grassland species are relatively unimportant, given the large amount of plasticity in these traits. Interspecific differences in SLA and vertical stature seemed to be more important in explaining the position of species along the successional gradient.",,"OLFF, H (corresponding author), UNIV GRONINGEN, DEPT PLANT BIOL, POB 14, 9750 AA HAREN, NETHERLANDS.",,"Olff, Han/A-8516-2008","Olff, Han/0000-0003-2154-3576",,,,25,62,69,3,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,1992,89,3,,,,,412,421,,10.1007/BF00317420,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HJ153,WOS:A1992HJ15300015,28313091,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

These models may fit the particular data sets of interest equally well, but may give quite different parameter estimates or predictions under different (extrapolated) conditions. Such competing models can be discriminated by a number of methods, including potential refutation by means of strategic experiments, and their ability to suitably incorporate all relevant physiological processes. For illustration, three currently used models for steady-state hepatic elimination-the venous equilibration model, the parallel tube model, and the distributed sinusoidal perfusion model-are reviewed and compared with particular reference to their application in the area of risk assessment. The ability of each of the models to describe and incorporate such physiological processes as protein binding, precursor-metabolite relations and hepatic zones of elimination, capillary recruitment, capillary heterogeneity, and intrahepatic shunting is discussed. Differences between the models in hepatic parameter estimation, extrapolation to different conditions, and interspecies scaling are discussed, and criteria for choosing one model over the others are presented. In this case, the distributed model provides the most general framework for describing physiological processes taking place in the liver, and has so far not been experimentally refuted, as have the other two models.

These guilds are analyzed according to the following framework: ecological-evolutionary history, empirical patterns in space and time (e.g., spatial distribution of species per host patch), factors affecting guild structure (e.g., interspecific competition, structure of host population), ecological effect on the host population (e.g., spatial density dependence), and relationship between guild structure and ecological effect (e.g., species-dependent mortality). It is suggested that analysis of natural enemy guilds may be of value in deriving introduction strategies in both classical and augmentative biological control. The importation of Encarsia aurantii (Howard) into California for control of obscure scale is described as a case in point. Some additional implications of guild analysis for biological control are discussed.","JASPER RIDGE BIOL PRESERVE,STANFORD,CA","EHLER, LE (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT ENTOMOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,,,,,46,33,34,0,13,ENTOMOL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"9301 ANNAPOLIS RD, LANHAM, MD 20706",0046-225X,,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

For one species, the ontogenetic trajectories obtained through length and height of valves differed considerably in distinct areas. In the first case, trajectories showing well-separated development stages and slight intraspecific variability in length and height were seen. In the second, trajectories showing valves which are difficult to relate to one stage or another and a high intraspecific variability were noted. In the latter, the uncertainties in the determination of the development stages were resolved by using a statistical method. Furthermore, this allowed for the comparison of the variations in ontogenesis (augmentation or reduction in the development), in relation to abiotic (detrital supply and upwelling processes) and biotic ecological factors (faunal density and interspecific competition). Comparisons were also made with ornamental variations observed on Chrysocythere ornata, which are directly linked with bioprecipitation (environmental) conditions. This comparison highlights the role played by abiotic and trophic factors on the developmental variations of ostracods in some continental shelves areas. This work shows that ontogenetic variations depend either on biotic or abiotic factors. They can act in different ways on distinct species and one can be predominant in a particular biota. Once the architectural characters have appeared, their variations no more depend on ontogenetic development.

Zooplankton density, production and food ingestion of vendace larvae at different densities in net enclosures were compared in Lake Yla-Enonvesi, eastern Finland. The model was fitted for different fish densities using feeding time as an iterative parameter. The growth of the larvae was greatly affected by the fish density in the enclosures. At higher density the larvae could capture less food daily than at low density; this is obviously caused partly by a high scramble competition and the ensuing decrease in efficient feeding time. It is suggested that when the hatching of the larvae is synchronized close to the break-up of the ice, a shortage of prey animals alone should not cause the high mortality of vendace larvae. While death of larvae as a direct result of the low food density is suggested to be rare, scarce or variable food conditions, high intra- or interspecific competition for food or predation disturbance may result in increased energy costs, weak growth and decreased survival of the larvae.",,"KARJALAINEN, J (corresponding author), UNIV JOENSUU,KARELIAN INST,POB 111,SF-80101 JOENSUU,FINLAND.",,"Karjalainen, Juha/B-4079-2015","Karjalainen, Juha/0000-0001-9302-1174",,,,49,19,20,1,8,FINNISH ZOOLOGICAL BOTANICAL PUBLISHING BOARD,HELSINKI,"UNIV HELSINKI P O BOX 17 (P.

None of the pairs were in fact competitors. The isopod Caecidotea holsingeri was an amensalist of the amphipod Stygobromus spinatus in the laboratory, but the two did not interact in the field. The amphipod Gammarus minus was a predator on C. holsingeri both in laboratory streams and in the field, and C holsingeri was a competitor of G. minus, at least in laboratory streams. Stygobromus emarginatus was an amensalist of G. minus in laboratory streams and in the field; but in the field G. minus was a commensalist of S. emarginatus. This combination of commensalism and amensalism produces the dynamics of a predator-prey system. Interactions in both laboratory streams and cave streams were asymmetric and often had characteristics of several kinds of interspecific interactions. Negative interactions dominated in laboratory streams while positive interactions were more common in the field experiments. Negative interactions had an effect on microdistribution only at the level of individual stones in a riffle.

In this article I develop a more general model of local mate competition that incorporates fertilization efficiency. I use this model to predict interspecific differences in sex allocation. These predictions are tested by using dry weights of male and female gonadal tissue from six species of hermaphroditic sea basses. In all four paired comparisons, when two of the three factors presumed to determine sex allocation patterns are relatively constant, the shift in sex allocation between species is correctly predicted. Neither levels of sperm competition nor the expected effects of spawning behavior on fertilization efficiency can account for all of the differences in sex allocation, although sperm competition does correctly predict the most differences in sex allocation. Overall, the interspecific differences are predicted by either the level of sperm competition or by factors affecting fertilization efficiency. A broader view of local mate competition that includes aspects of sperm competition and the dynamics of fertilization should ultimately provide more accurate predictions of sex allocation in hermaphroditic organisms.","SMITHSONIAN TROP RES INST, APO, MIAMI, FL 34002 USA",,,,,,,,39,71,71,1,15,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Two conditions must be met to support this contention. First, the attractiveness of herbivores to ants must vary predictably with intra- and/or interspecific changes in host-plant quality. Such variation will occur if a) the chemical composition and/or quantity of ant attractants (excretions and secretions) produced by herbivores varies with changes in host quality and b) ants preferentially tend those herbivores that produce the most nutritionally rewarding attractants. Second, the number of tending ants must have a significant effect on the fitness of herbivores. While there is abundant evidence to support these individual conditions, few studies have examined both conditions for a single herbivore-ant association. I outline a series of testable predictions based on the host-mediation hypothesis. 1) The effects of host plants will vary with the degree to which herbivores depend on ants. 2) Hosts will affect the ability of herbivores to compete for ant mutualists. 3) Tended herbivores will exhibit host-selection behaviors that increase their ability to attract ants. And most importantly, 4) variation in host quality will predict fluctuations in the strength and sign of herbivore-ant interactions. I present a graphical model to illustrate 1) the ways in which plant-induced variation in the value of attractants to ant colonies can be used to predict switchpoints in the behavior of ants and 2) the effects of distance to servicing ant nests and nutritional status of these colonies on the predictions.",,"CUSHMAN, JH (corresponding author), MACQUARIE UNIV, SCH BIOL SCI, SYDNEY, NSW 2109, AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,71,80,83,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,1991,61,1,,,,,138,142,,10.2307/3545416,,,5,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FR485,WOS:A1991FR48500016,,,,,2021-09-21,

In this paper we contrast the reproductive behavior of species within two crustacean groups: the mantis shrimps (stomatopods) and the fiddler crabs (genus Uca). For the stomatopods, we identify probable selective relationships between features of species' ecology and their mating systems. Population density, the kind and availability of shelters in which these shrimps live, the intensity of predation and spawning cycles all play important roles in molding reproductive behavior in this group. Associations between the ecology and mating systems of fiddler crabs have been discussed recently elsewhere. Here we focus on a comparative analysis of sexual communication in these crabs. A study of competitive courtship signaling and mate choice in the fiddler crab Uca beebei has shown that certain male courtship signals are highly attractive probably because they exploit female sensory-response systems that have been molded by selection for escape from predators. Interspecific comparison of male courtship displays and the responses of females to these displays suggest that sensory exploitation may play an important role in the evolution of sexual signals in the genus. Comparative studies have advanced our understanding of how natural and sexual selection affect the reproductive behavior of both stomatopods and fiddler crabs.","FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,BOCA RATON,FL 33431","CHRISTY, JH (corresponding author), SMITHSONIAN TROP RES INST,APARTADO 2072,BALBOA,PANAMA.",,,,,,,46,78,79,0,21,AMER SOC ZOOLOGISTS,LAWRENCE,"1041 NEW HAMPSHIRE ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",0003-1569,,,AM ZOOL,Am.

From April to October the population consisted of two cohorts, except in June and July when the population density was low and only one cohort, of young hydroids, was identifiable. The paucity of O. crenata in summer was attributed to the high rate of turnover of host thalli, interspecific competition with other epiphytes, and a possible shortage of suitable planktonic prey. Recruitment was predominantly asexual, by stolons, and occurred throughout the year. Gonozoids were found only from late October to early December when recruitment by planula larvae also occurred. In winter, when the cohorts lived for the maximum of almost-equal-to 6 wk, colony sizes quintuplicated and triplicated in successive 15-day periods.

Economical damage (i. e. reduction of the yield) is usually confined to fish farms. Grey Herons may take some 0.4-8 % of the production of efficiently managed farms, whereas Cormorants can be responsible for losses of 20 % to > 50 % under certain circumstances. The influence of birds is often overestimated by fish farmers if they do not separate predation from other causes of mortality. Neither economical nor ecological damage (i. e. negative influence on the population resulting in long-term decline) have been reported from lakes, although total fish stocks were rarely assessed. In these cases, waterfowl took less than 5 % of the biomass of most fish species; under brackish conditions the maximum was 36 %. Commercial catches are often 10-20 times higher than the consumption by the main avian predators (tab. 1). Even on Central European lakes with high Cormorant densities, fishermen take 4-12 times as much as the Cormorants, and annual variations in the catch can amount to a multiple of the bird consumption (fig. 1). Moreover, waterbirds often prey upon commercially unimportant and abundant fish and may therefore reduce competitive pressure on commercial species. Predation rates in streams and rivers are usually higher than in lakes, but in most cases the avian predation does not seem to exceed the range of compensatory mortality. The few reports of waterbirds apparently responsible for added mortality (thus competing with fisheries), mostly refer to canalised rivers with inadequate structural properties for the high fish populations they are stocked with. Altogether predator-prey relationships between waterbirds and freshwater fish remain little studied. Possibilities of fishponds for conducting experiments have particularly been underused.",,"SUTER, W (corresponding author), SCHWEIZER VOGELWARTE SEMPACH,CH-6204 SEMPACH,SWITZERLAND.",,,,,,,77,12,14,0,38,DEUTSCHE ORNITHOLOGIE-GESELL,FRANKFURT,"SENCKENBERGANLAGE 25, W-6000 FRANKFURT, GERMANY",0021-8375,,,J ORNITHOL,J.

Playback of teydea and tintillon song in the zone of overlap between the two species led to heterospecific response in only a few cases, indicating that they are not usually interspecifically territorial.

Against this background, the structuring role of S. entomon for the benthic infauna in shallow brackish waters was tested in relation to (a) one major invertebrate food competitor (Libellula quadrimaculata; Odonata), and (b) prey species of varying ecological origin (marine or estuarine, exemplified by Macoma balthica and Corophium volutator, and limnic, e.g. Asellus aquaticus and larval chironomids). Field and aquarium experiments illustrated that S. entomon is technically capable by predation to exhibit a regulatory pressure on all prey items offered, but that the effects at community level are difficult to distinguish from the natural variation within the ecosystem. On shallow bottoms S. entomon exhibits similar predatory effects to the larvae of the dragonfly L. quadrimaculata. It is concluded that S. entomon in shallow Baltic archipelagoes is something of a universal competitor, capable of affecting populations regardless of their functional origin.","ABO AKAD UNIV,HUSO BIOL STN,SF-20500 TURKU,FINLAND","SANDBERG, E (corresponding author), ABO AKAD UNIV,DEPT BIOL,SF-20500 TURKU,FINLAND.",,,"Bonsdorff, Erik/0000-0001-5070-4880",,,,33,12,12,0,4,FINNISH ZOOLOGICAL BOTANICAL PUBLISHING BOARD,HELSINKI,"UNIV HELSINKI P O BOX 17 (P.

Ontogenetic dietary changes and spatial, temporal and interspecific differences in diet were determined. Johniops vogleri and Polynemus multiradiatus were predominantly planktonic feeders. At an early stage of development, these fish fed mainly on copepods, which were progressively replaced by larger prey such as mysids and Acetes as the fish grew. Arius graeffei and Aseraggodes macleayanus were mainly benthic feeders. Spatial and temporal differences in diet were also evident for each species. These differences probably reflected changes in prey availability resulting from flood-induced changes to the salinity gradient. The potential for competition between Johniops vogleri and Polynemus multiradiatus was reduced by temporal partitioning of food resources as the fish grew.","UNIV QUEENSLAND,DEPT ZOOL,ST LUCIA,QLD 4067,AUSTRALIA",,,,,,,,21,13,14,0,9,C S I R O PUBLICATIONS,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",0067-1940,,,AUST J MAR FRESH RES,,,1990,41,6,,,,,795,806,,,,,12,Fisheries; Limnology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,EV484,WOS:A1990EV48400010,,,,,2021-09-21,

These detrimental nontarget effects motivate the use of alternative pest management strategies such as host plant resistance and intercropping. However, when alternative pest management strategies effectively suppress primary pests, they also have the potential to promote secondary pest populations via competitive release. The potato leafhopper (Empoasca fabae) is a key pest of alfalfa, and leafhopper-resistant cultivars are being widely adopted by growers in the Midwest and Northeast United States. We conducted a field experiment comparing leafhopper-susceptible alfalfa, leafhopper-resistant alfalfa, and leafhopper-resistant alfalfa intercropped with orchardgrass. Leafhopper-resistant alfalfa reduced potato leafhopper abundance and protected the crop from protein loss, but there was no benefit of intercropping leafhopper-resistant alfalfa with orchardgrass. Importantly, the abundance of a secondary pest, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), was twice as high in the leafhopper-resistant plant treatments compared to the leafhopper-susceptible treatment. Field sampling and microcosm experiments confirmed that the increase in pea aphids was caused, at least in part, by release from competition with leafhoppers. These results suggest that, when host plant resistance against insects is employed, efforts to monitor and manage secondary pest populations are warranted.","[Straub, Cory S.] Ursinus Coll, Dept Biol, 601 Main St, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA; [Faselt, Jamie A.] AmeriCorps VISTA, Glacier Natl Pk,POB 125, East Glacier, MT 59343 USA; [Keyser, Erich S.] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Traugott, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Ecol, Mt Agr Res, Technikerstr 25, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Straub, CS (corresponding author), Ursinus Coll, Dept Biol, 601 Main St, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA.",cstraub@ursinus.edu,,"Straub, Cory/0000-0002-2776-1817",AFRI-USDA-NIFA [2013-02482]; Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute,"We thank Matthew Wismer of Northern Star Farm for planting and managing the field experiment and Mark Sulc for advice on establishing the experimental plots.

Despite its importance, there is no detailed study of hybridization rates in fern populations. A proper estimate of hybridization rates is needed to understand factors regulating hybridization. Methods We studied hybridization in the European Dryopteris carthusiana group, represented by one diploid and two tetraploid species and their hybrids. We sampled 100 individuals per population in 40 mixed populations of the D. carthusiana group across Europe. All plants were identified by measuring genome size (DAPI staining) using flow cytometry. To determine the maternal parentage of hybrids, we sequenced the chloroplast region trnL-trnF of all taxa involved. Results We found hybrids in 85% of populations. Triploid D. xambroseae occurred in every population that included both parent species and is most abundant when the parent species are equally abundant. By contrast, tetraploid D. xdeweveri was rare (15 individuals total) and triploid D. xsarvelae was absent. The parentage of hybrid taxa is asymmetric. Despite expectations from previous studies, tetraploid D. dilatata is the predominant male parent of its triploid hybrid. Conclusions This is a thorough investigation of hybridization rates in natural populations of ferns. Hybridization rates differ greatly even among closely related fern taxa. In contrast to angiosperms, our data suggest that hybridization rates are highest in balanced parent populations and support the notion that some ferns possess very weak barriers to hybridization. Our results from sequencing cpDNA challenge established notions about the correlation of ploidy level and mating tendencies.","[Hornych, Ondrej; Ekrt, Libor; Koutecky, Petr; Kosnar, Jiri] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Branisovska 1760, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Riedel, Felix] Univ Potsdam, Botan Garten, Maulbeerallee 3, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Riedel, Felix] Humboldt Univ, Arboretum, Spathstr 80-81, D-12437 Berlin, Germany","Hornych, O (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Branisovska 1760, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",hornych.ondrej@gmail.com,"Ekrt, Libor/AAL-8458-2020","Kosnar, Jiri/0000-0001-5128-593X",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [19-17379S],The authors thank S.

In this study we investigated whether prey quantity and egg presence (varying in relatedness and age) influence oviposition behavior in the zigzag ladybird, Menochilus sexmaculatus (Fabricius). Influence of these factors on cannibalism by females was also investigated and we tried to observe whether cannibalism was a modifying mechanism during oviposition site selection. Females were placed in prey abundant or scarce conditions in presence of related or unrelated eggs of varying ages, and their oviposition (for 24 h), egg viability and cannibalism were recorded. Prey-scarce conditions significantly decreased oviposition but had no influence on egg viability. Prey scarcity also increased the incidence of cannibalism by females. Females avoided laying eggs in the presence of related eggs regardless of their age. On the other hand, cannibalism was more in related eggs that were older in age. This increased cannibalism in presence of older related eggs, may be a comprehensive way of eliminating potential competition threats from a potential oviposition site already having eggs. All the independent factors (prey quantity, egg relatedness and egg age) did not affect egg viability, is the suggestive of male nutritional status rather than female.","[Singh, Shashwat; Mishra, Geetanjali; Omkar] Univ Lucknow, Dept Zool, Ladybird Res Lab, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India","Omkar, (corresponding author), Univ Lucknow, Dept Zool, Ladybird Res Lab, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India.",omkaar55@hotmail.com,,"Mishra, Geetanjali/0000-0001-8976-4602","University Grants Commission, New Delhi, IndiaUniversity Grants Commission, India; Department of Higher Education, Government of Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow, India","Shashwat Singh is thankful to University Grants Commission, New Delhi, India for BSR fellowship.

As its pests are mainly controlled with insecticides that are harmful to the environment and human health, alternative practices such as intercropping have been studied for their potential to promote biological control. Based on the published literature, this study aimed to review the effect of wheat-based intercropping systems on insect pests and their natural enemies. Fifty original research papers were obtained from a systematic search of the peer-reviewed literature. Results from a vote-counting analysis indicated that, in the majority of studies, pest abundance was significantly reduced in intercropping systems compared with pure stands. However, the occurrence of their natural enemies as well as predation and parasitism rates were not significantly increased. The country where the studies took place, the type of intercropping and the crop that was studied in the association had significant effects on these results. These findings show that intercropping is a viable practice to reduce insecticide use in wheat production systems. Nevertheless, other practices could be combined with intercropping to favour natural enemies and enhance pest control.

Two strains of L. monocytogenes, two culture temperatures and two biofilm developmental stages were investigated. Both L. monocytogenes strains, a persistently sampled isolate (collected repeatedly along 3 years from a meat factory) and Scott A, induced shrinkage in matrix volume, both at 20 degrees C and 4 degrees C, in mature or old biofilms, without loss of P fluorescens cell count per surface unit. The nearly homogeneous pattern of surface coverage shown by mono-species P fluorescens biofilms, turned into more irregular layouts in co-culture with L. monocytogenes. The upper layer of both mono and dual-species biofilms turned to predominantly consist of matrix, with plenty of viable cells underneath, in old biofilms cultured at 20 degrees C, but not in those grown at 4 degrees C. Between 15 and 56% of the substratum area was covered by biofilm, the extent depending on temperature, time and L. monocytogenes strain. Real biofilms in food-related surfaces may thus be very heterogeneous regarding their superficial components, i.e., those more accessible to disinfectants.

Land snails, particularly endemic land snails of oceanic islands, are the group of molluscs that have sustained the most extinctions. Understanding their ecology and the evolutionary processes that have led to their extreme vulnerability is crucial if we are to be able to conserve these diverse and important species. Oceanic island snails tend to have low a-diversity and high beta-diversity, and divergence of habitat use among related species is known to occur in some radiations of land snails on oceanic islands. Processes of speciation and ecological interaction are possible major drivers of these patterns. The ecological opportunities available at the initial stage of insular evolution and the scarcity of effective predators may have led to divergence of habitat use and high beta-diversity in oceanic island snails. Fewer and less diverse predators on oceanic islands lead to the evolution of fewer and less diverse defense traits in oceanic island snails, which results in their high vulnerability to non-native predators. High beta-diversity of oceanic island snails also results in great vulnerability to habitat loss. Accordingly, the high susceptibility of oceanic island snails to extinction reflects their evolutionary history.","[Chiba, Satoshi] Tohoku Univ, Ctr Northeast Asian Studies, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Chiba, Satoshi] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan; [Cowie, Robert H.] Univ Hawaii, Pacific Biosci Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Chiba, S (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Ctr Northeast Asian Studies, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan.; Chiba, S (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan.",schiba@biology.tohoku.ac.jp; cowie@hawaii.edu,"Cowie, Robert/AAM-9509-2020","Chiba, Satoshi/0000-0001-9273-0307","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16K14804] Funding Source: KAKEN",,,116,28,30,1,35,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1543-592X,,978-0-8243-1447-7,ANNU REV ECOL EVOL S,Annu.

Empirical support for this approach relies on our ability to use observations of a species' distribution in one region to predict its range in other regions (model transferability). On the basis of this observation, ecologists have hypothesized that climate is the strongest determinant of species' distributions at large spatial scales. However, it is difficult to reconcile this claim with the pervasive effects of biotic interactions.

Here, we present a unique combination of observations and experiments demonstrating that seed predation and soil properties strongly limit regeneration beyond the upper elevational range limit of sugar maple, a tree species of major economic importance. Most strikingly, regeneration beyond the range limit occurred almost exclusively when seeds were experimentally protected from predators. Regeneration from seed was depressed on soil from beyond the range edge when this soil was transplanted to sites within the range, with indirect evidence suggesting that fungal pathogens play a role. Non-climatic factors are clearly in need of careful attention when attempting to predict the biotic consequences of climate change. At minimum, we can expect non-climatic factors to create substantial time lags between the creation of more favourable climatic conditions and range expansion.","[Brown, Carissa D.; Vellend, Mark] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Brown, Carissa D.] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Geog, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada","Brown, CD (corresponding author), Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Biol, 2500 Boule Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.",carissa.brown@mun.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,Funding was provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.,,60,88,88,4,105,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Fox research in the greater Prudhoe Bay area from the 1970s through the early 1990s focused primarily on Arctic foxes in relation to oil development because red foxes were uncommon. A monitoring program in 2005-12 included annual surveys of 31-48 fox dens within 2 km of the road system. In 2005, 2006, and 2008, Arctic fox dens outnumbered those of red foxes, but from 2010 onward, the reverse was true. There is greater distance between natal dens of Arctic foxes and those of red foxes than between natal dens within each species, suggesting that Arctic foxes avoid red fox denning territories. Of dens in our study that were used by Arctic foxes prior to 2005, 50% have since been occupied by red foxes. Red foxes displaced Arctic foxes from dens closest to oil field camps, pads, and other facilities, and preyed on their pups. Access to anthropogenic food sources probably supports red foxes in the area. Predictions from climate change studies indicate the displacement of Arctic foxes by red foxes will continue in the Alaskan Arctic, although the change may be slower away from areas of human occupation and anthropogenic foods.","[Stickney, Alice A.; Obritschkewitsch, Tim; Burgess, Robert M.] ABR Inc, Environm Res & Serv, Fairbanks, AK 99708 USA","Stickney, AA (corresponding author), ABR Inc, Environm Res & Serv, POB 80410, Fairbanks, AK 99708 USA.",astickney@abrinc.com,,,BP,"We would like to thank Dr. Bill Streever, BP Senior Environmental Studies Advisor, for instituting the long-term monitoring studies of which this fox study is part and for his continued support, and Dr. Diane Sanzone, formerly with BP Environmental Studies, for overseeing the early years of the project.

Culex pipiens and Culex restuans were the first mosquito species to colonize ground-container habitats and were the dominant larval species throughout the study period, whereas Ae. albopictus was late to colonize ground habitats and accounted for less than 15% of weekly larval collections once established. Ae. albopictus had a much stronger community presence within treehole ovitraps; however, Ae. albopictus never reached the average larval densities of the expected primary colonizer, Ae. triseriatus. Throughout the study period, the weekly abundances of Ae. triseriatus and Ae. albopictus were positively correlated and there were no significant differences between the abundances of each species. The larval dominance of Ae. triseriatus appears to be enhanced by the presence of Toxorhynchites rutilus septentrionalis, a large predatory mosquito species. When Tx. rut. septentrionalis was present, mature larvae (3rd4th instar) of Ae. albopictus were also present in only 16.7% of collections, whereas mature larvae of Ae. triseriatus were collected concurrently with Tx. rut. septentrionalis in 53.8% of collections. These data suggest that Ae. triseriatus is at a greater risk of displacement by Ae. albopictus than are Cx. pipiens and Cx. restuans.","[Johnson, B. J.; Sukhdeo, M. V.

Conversely, C. americana, the wild American hazelnut, is generally highly tolerant of EFB, although it lacks many horticultural attributes necessary for commercial nut production. Hybrids of C. americana and avellana combine the EFB resistance of the wild species with the improved nut quality of the European species. However, inheritance of EFB resistance from C. americana remains unclear with existing hybrids derived from a very limited selection of parents. To investigate this topic, C. americana and advanced-generation C. americana x C. avellana hybrids were crossed with susceptible C. avellana and the resulting seedlings exposed to EFB through field inoculations and natural disease spread. In the winter after their fifth growing season, plants were rated for the presence of EFB using an index of 0 (no disease) through 5 (all stems containing cankers). The three progeny related to C. americana 'Rush' segregated for resistance in a ratio of one resistant to one susceptible, suggesting the presence of a single dominant R gene. A wide array of disease responses was observed for the other progenies with some expressing little EFB resistance or tolerance and others showing a distribution of disease phenotypes typical of control by multiple genes. Overall, the results indicate that both qualitative and quantitative resistance is present in C. americana. They also suggest that the choice of C. americana parent as well as the C. avellana parent will play a significant role in obtaining useful levels of EFB resistance in hybrid offspring, although the degree of disease expression in the parents may not be a useful predictor of progeny performance. Thus, more research is needed to understand inheritance of resistance, especially in advanced-generation backcrosses to susceptible C. avellana.","[Molnar, Thomas J.; Capik, John M.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Plant Biol & Pathol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Molnar, TJ (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Plant Biol & Pathol, Foran Hall,59 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",molnar@aesop.rutgers.edu,"Capik, John/AAD-3416-2021; Molnar, Thomas/AAC-1429-2021","Molnar, Thomas/0000-0001-6099-4244",New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station; Rutgers Center for Turfgrass Science; USDA-NIFAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA); USDA Specialty Crops Research Initiative Competitive Grant [2009-51181-06028],"Funding for this research comes from the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, the Rutgers Center for Turfgrass Science, Hatch funds provided by USDA-NIFA, and the USDA Specialty Crops Research Initiative Competitive Grant 2009-51181-06028.",,48,9,9,0,7,AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,ALEXANDRIA,"113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA",0018-5345,,,HORTSCIENCE,Hortscience,OCT,2012,47,10,,,,,1412,1418,,10.21273/HORTSCI.47.10.1412,,,7,Horticulture,Agriculture,028GG,WOS:000310410200006,,gold,,,2021-09-21,

Relationships between age-0 bluegill and yellow perch growth and relative abundance were explored across multiple lakes and years within the Nebraska Sandhill region, USA. In addition, four habitat patch types (open water, Phragmites spp., Typha spp., Scirpus spp.) were sampled for age-0 bluegill and yellow perch, and food habits were examined for each species during August, September, and October of 2009 in one of these lakes. Age-0 yellow perch growth was negatively related to age-0 bluegill relative abundance across a spatiotemporal scale. Age-0 bluegill and yellow perch exhibited similar habitat use (moderate-high overlap), but generally consumed different important and dominant prey taxa (bluegill consumed both macroinvertebrates-56 % and zooplankton-44 %, while yellow perch consumed more zooplankton-66 %), which resulted in low overall diet overlap between species. Previous research indicates that age-0 yellow perch diet ontogeny often results in feeding predominately on macroinvertebrates and positively selecting them (and avoiding zooplankton prey) at sizes observed in our study. Therefore, yellow perch growth rates may be compromised by the presence of bluegill because of the need to consume less energetically profitable prey items such as zooplankton.","[Kaemingk, Mark A.; Willis, David W.] S Dakota State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Management, Brookings, SD 57007 USA","Kaemingk, MA (corresponding author), S Dakota State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Management, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.",mark.kaemingk@sdstate.edu,"Kaemingk, Mark/Q-2191-2019","Kaemingk, Mark/0000-0001-9588-4563",Nebraska Game and Parks Commission through Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Project [F-118-R],"We thank D.

We used annual censuses to study the demography of agile gibbons (Hylobates agilis) between 1998 and 2009 in rain forests of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Indonesia. The population declined from 22 individuals (9 groups) to 14 individuals (5 groups) over the 12 yr of study. Infant survival to the juvenile age class was 33.3%, and 16.7% of infants survived to the subadult age class. The interbirth interval was 3.83 +/- 1.15 yr and birth rate was 0.22-0.28 infants female(-1) yr(-1). Two groups colonized the study area but subsequently disappeared. We documented 7 immigrations, 17 disappearances, and >= 10 transients in the population. Compared to lar gibbons (Hylobates lar) and Bornean white-bearded gibbons (Hylobates albibarbis), Way Canguk's agile gibbon population is characterized by slow reproduction, low survival, and high group turnover. We hypothesize that, although the habitat is high in fruit resources, agile gibbons may be displaced or excluded from the best fruit resources by larger and more numerous competitors, incurring costs of decreased opportunities to forage and increased travel, and leading to higher mortality for young agile gibbons. The reproductive potential of this agile gibbon population is insufficient to compensate for high mortality, and the population is unlikely to persist without immigration from outside the area. Given the agile gibbons' endangered status and limited capacity to respond demographically to change, it is likely that intensive management interventions will be required to conserve this species.","[O'Brien, Timothy G.; Kinnaird, Margaret F.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; [O'Brien, Timothy G.; Kinnaird, Margaret F.] Mpala Res Ctr, Nanyuki 10400, Kenya","O'Brien, TG (corresponding author), Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bronx, NY 10460 USA.",tobrien@wcs.org,,,U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service [98210-1-G084]; Disney Conservation Fund,"This research is a collaborative effort by the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry, Directorate General for Nature Conservation (PHKA).

Elevated CO2 induced a decline in foliar nitrogen, which reduced the growth of chewing insects. Phloem-sucking insects (i.e. aphid), however, had species-specific responses to elevated CO2 and were the only feeding guild to respond positively to elevated CO2. Although many studies attempt to illuminate the interaction between aphids and plants under elevated CO2, few studies can explain why some aphids are more successful than other chewing insects in elevated CO2. Elevated CO2 leads to a re-allocation of the carbon and nitrogen resources in plant tissue, which increases the thickness of the microscopic structures of leaves, reduces amino acids content of leaf phloem sap and increases the secondary metabolites. Considering the complexity of aphid-plant interactions, it is difficult and unreasonable to predict the general response of aphids to elevated CO2 using a single plant component. Instead, it is more likely that aphids are able to overcome the disadvantages of the indirect effects of elevated CO2 by reducing developmental times and increasing fecundity under elevated CO2 conditions. Our results provide several clues to why some aphids are successful in elevated CO2 conditions. We review recent studies of the effects of elevated CO2 on aphids and discuss the effects of elevated CO2 on aphid performance on crops using cotton and cereal aphids as examples.

Anim Ecol 53: 573-580; 1984) The method has been used repeatedly, although there has been no attempt to verify the relationship between r' and the per capita growth rate in populations. This method was tested with laboratory populations of the mosquito Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera Culicidae) growing at three larval densities Survival and fecundity schedules enabled calculation of per capita growth rate, r, for each population, whereas measuring emergent females enabled the calculation of r'. The capacity of r' to predict r was significant, although a substantial amount of variation in r remained unaccounted for, and r' overestimated r The degree of overestimation of r by r' was consistent across the three densities, and the regressions of r and r' versus density were similar. Overestimation of per capita rate of change by r' is attributed largely to extensive adult longevity in laboratory conditions for this species, coupled with a lengthy reproductive period, in combination with prereproductive adult mortality, both of which are assumed to be negligible with the r' method Separate indicators of larval success were also tested for their predictions of r; only first day emergence and average development time were significant predictors although neither performed as well as r' The r' index accounted for the largest fraction of variation in r. Implications of overestimating r by r' to estimating other population parameters are discussed.","[Chmielewski, M.

Freshwater communities are often structured by predation. In permanent lentic freshwater habitats dragonfly larvae are major predators which, in return, suffer predation by fish. Antipredator traits vary between the dragonfly species, and the dragonfly communities are therefore shaped by the presence of fish. But fish communities vary, and as different fish species affect dragonflies in different ways, the species composition of the fish community may affect the composition of the dragonfly community. 2. We sampled dragonfly larvae in 24 lakes with a known fish stock in south-western Sweden, and explored the impact of fish as well as vegetation structure on dragonfly communities by means of multivariate analyses. 3. We found that the presence of four fish species affected the community structure of dragonflies. The impact strength depended mainly on the abundance of Perca fluviatilis, with which most dragonfly species were negatively correlated. Many dragonfly species were also positively correlated with the occurrence of at least one fish species, which may reflect similar habitat requirements or imply indirect positive effects of these fish species. 4. Of the 24 recorded dragonfly species, four did not occur in lakes dominated by P. fluviatilis, whereas only one species was lacking in lakes dominated by Rutilus rutilus. The dragonfly species diversity was higher in R. rutilus lakes than in P. fluviatilis lakes. 5. Our results suggest that the fish species composition is a major determinant of the dragonfly community, which in turn will influence the lower trophic levels.","[Wittwer, Torben] Lund Univ, Dept Earth & Ecosyst Sci, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Wittwer, Torben; Suhling, Frank] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Geookol, Braunschweig, Germany; [Wittwer, Torben; Sahlen, Goran] Halmstad Univ, Halmstad, Sweden","Wittwer, T (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Earth & Ecosyst Sci, Solvegatan 12, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",torben.wittwer@nateko.lu.se,"Suhling, Frank/AAB-8460-2019","Suhling, Frank/0000-0003-2922-0261",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [Ri 534/11-1]; Halmstad University,"This work is the result of a Diploma thesis completed at Dept. of Environmental System Analysis, Institute of Geoecology, Technische Universitat Braunschweig in cooperation with Halmstad University.

Using a conventional and a phylogenetically controlled meta-analytical approach on a data set of 40 studies, we evaluated the effect of alien neighbour plant species (aliens) on visitation to and reproduction of native co-flowering focal species (focals), and compared such effect to that of native neighbours (natives). An overall significantly negative effect of aliens on visitation to and reproduction of focals was confirmed. Interestingly, aliens differed from natives in their effect on visitation, but not on reproductive success. The negative effect of aliens on visitation and reproductive success increased at high relative alien plant abundance, but this increase was proportionally lower than the increase in relative plant abundance. Likewise, effect of aliens on visitation and reproductive success was most detrimental when alien and focal species had similar flower symmetry or colour. The phylogenetic relatedness between alien neighbours and focals influenced the reproductive success effect size. Results of the phylogenetic meta-analysis were only partly consistent with those of the conventional meta-analysis, depending on the response variable and on whether we controlled for the phylogeny of neighbour or focal species, which calls for special attention to control for species relatedness in this type of review. This study demonstrates the predominant detrimental impact of alien plants on pollination and reproduction of natives, and highlights the importance of phenotypic similarity to the outcome of the interaction.","[Traveset, Anna] UIB, CSIC, Inst Mediterrani Estudis Avancats, Mallorca 07190, Balearic Isl, Spain; [Laura Morales, Carolina] CONICET UNCO, INIBIOMA, Lab Ecotono, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Traveset, A (corresponding author), UIB, CSIC, Inst Mediterrani Estudis Avancats, Mallorca 07190, Balearic Isl, Spain.",atraveset@uib.es,"Traveset, Anna V/D-7802-2011",,CONICET (Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [CGL2007-61165BOS],"We specially thank to C.

We address this by considering the coevolution of dispersal strategies in a host-parasitoid system. An individual-based host-parasitoid metapopulation model was constructed for a patchy environment, allowing for evolution in dispersal rates of both species. Highly rarefied environments with few suitable patches selected against dispersal in both species, as did relatively static environments. Provided that parasitoids persist, all the variables studied led to stable equilibria in dispersal rates for both species. There was a tendency toward higher dispersal rates in parasitoids because of the asymmetric relationships of the two species to the patches: vacant patches are most valuable for hosts, but unsuitable for parasitoids, which require an established host population to reproduce. High host dispersal rate was favoured by high host population growth rate, and in the parasitoid by high growth rates in both species.","Univ Stirling, Inst Aquaculture, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland","Green, DM (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Inst Aquaculture, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",darren.green@stir.ac.uk,"Green, Darren/I-6436-2012","Green, Darren/0000-0001-9026-5675",,,,40,14,14,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

We present a mathematical model of the dominance-discovery trade-off, the trade-off between the abilities to find and to control resources, showing that it can in principle facilitate the coexistence of large numbers of species. Baiting studies of dominance and discovery abilities in an ant community from the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona indicate that real communities fail to fit the assumptions of the simple model in several ways: ( 1) dominance depends on the size of the food resource; ( 2) for some ants, dominance depends on the presence or absence of specialist parasitoids; ( 3) pairwise dominance is not an all-or-nothing trait; and ( 4) a consistent negative relationship between pairwise differences in per capita discovery rates and dominance can be detected for only one bait type. Extended models incorporating these factors successfully predict the coexistence of five of the six most abundant members of this community but fail to accurately predict their relative abundances. Sensitivity analysis indicates that each complicating factor enhances the extent of coexistence.","Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Univ Utah, Dept Math, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Adler, FR (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",adler@math.utah.edu; elebrun@mail.utexas.edu; feener@biology.utah.edu,,"LeBrun, Edward/0000-0002-7262-6585",,,,58,63,65,2,25,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

However, it is difficult to predict combinations of species and sites that will lead to these benefits. We review the processes and interactions occurring in mixed plantations, and the influence of species or site attributes, to aid the selection of successful combinations of species and sites. Successful mixtures, where productivity is increased over that of monocultures, have often developed stratified canopies, such that the less shade-tolerant species overtops the more shade-tolerant species. Successful mixtures also have significantly higher rates of N and P cycling than Eucalyptus monocultures. It is therefore important to select N-2-fixing species with readily decomposable litter and high rates of nutrient cycling, as well as high rates of N-2-fixation. While the dynamics of N-2-fixation in tree stands are not well understood, it appears as though eucalypts can benefit from fixed N as early as the first or second year following plantation establishment. A meta-analysis of 18 published studies revealed several trials in which mixtures were significantly (P < 0.001) more productive than monocultures, and no instances in which mixtures were less productive than monocultures. Regression analyses of such data were more informative than indices of relative yield, and were more informative in trials that contrasted four or more different species compositions. Thus replacement series examining compositions of 100:0, 67:33, 33:67, and 0: 100 were more informative than minimalist 100:0, 50:50 and 0: 100 series. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Fish stomach contents and invertebrate drift were collected concurrently during three diel cycles in August to September 1996. The food and feeding habits of an allopatric brook trout population in a nearby stream (Epinette) were studied for comparison. The diet feeding rhythms of the two coexisting fish species were similar. The composition of their diet, however, showed significant differences. Atlantic salmon predominantly (60-90%) fed on aquatic insects, mainly Ephemeroptera (35-60% of the diet). The brook trout mostly (50-80%) fed upon the allochthonous terrestrial insects (mainly adults of Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera) which comprised 5-40% of the stream drift. The allopatric brook trout fed opportunistically on the more abundant aquatic insects and terrestrial insects rarely formed 25% of its diet. The allopatric trout fed nearly twice as much as the sympatric brook trout during a day. The results suggest that the differences in feeding by brook trout in the two streams (with and without Atlantic salmon) are the result of inter-specific interaction with Atlantic salmon and are not related to the differences in food availability between the two streams. Food resource partitioning between Atlantic salmon and brook trout may be viewed as an adaptive response resulting in a greater exploitation of available resources and coexistence.

To help mitigate this problem, we review and synthesize the theoretical literature on TMIs and, in particular, on trait-mediated indirect interactions, TMIIs, in which the presence of one species mediates the interaction between a second and third species. (1) In models, TMIs tend to stabilize simple communities; adding further biological detail often reduces stability in models, but populations may persist even if their dynamics become mathematically unstable. (2) Short- and long-term changes in population density caused by TMIs depend even more on details, such as the curvature of functional responses and trade-offs, which have rarely been measured. (3) The effects of TMIs in multipredator communities depend in a straightforward way on the specificity of prey defenses. (4) Tritrophic and more complex communities are theoretically difficult; few general conclusions have emerged. Theory needs new kinds of experiments as a guide. The most critical needs are experiments that measure curvatures of trade-offs and responses, and experiments that (combined with theory) allow us to scale from short- to long-term responses of communities. Anecdotal evidence from long-term and large-scale studies suggests that TMIs may affect community dynamics at practical management scales; community models incorporating TMIs are necessary and require closer collaborations between theory and experiment.","Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Entomol, Dept Theoret Biol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Bolker, B (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",bolker@zoo.ufl.edu,"Krivan, Vlastimil/F-1709-2010; Holyoak, Marcel/C-3475-2009; Krivan, Vlastimil/J-7015-2019","Krivan, Vlastimil/0000-0003-0971-1231; Holyoak, Marcel/0000-0001-9727-3627; Bolker, Benjamin/0000-0002-2127-0443",,,,151,264,272,9,136,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2003,84,5,,,,,1101,1114,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1101:CTAESO]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,700PN,WOS:000184120500003,,,,,2021-09-21,

The first is based on an approximation to quantitative genetic recursion equations for sexual populations. The second is based on evolution in asexual lineages with mutation-generated variation. The third method finds an evolutionarily stable set of phenotypes for species characterized bq a given set of fitness functions, assuming that the mode of reproduction places no constraints on the number of distinct types that can be maintained in the population. The three methods share the property that the rate of change of a trait within a homogeneous population is approximately proportional to the individual fitness gradient. The methods differ in assumptions abc,ut the potential magnitude of phenotypic differences in mutant forms, and in their assumptions about the probability that invasion or speciation occurs when a species has a stable,yet invadable phenotype. Determining the range of applicability of the different methods is important for assessing the validity of optimization methods in predicting the evolutionary outcome of ecological interactions. Methods based on quantitative genetic models predict that fitness minimizing traits will often be evolutionarily stable over significant time periods, while other approaches suggest this is likely to be rare. A more detailed study of cases of disruptive selection might reveal whether fitness minimizing traits occur frequently in natural communities.","Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada","Abrams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, 25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",abrams@zoo.utoronto.ca,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X",,,,71,147,150,1,112,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Where feasible, accurate characterization of interaction strength can shift the theory of multispecies communities from identifying the vast range of possibilities to isolating the most likely possibilities. To derive generality in our understanding of interaction strengths, however. they must be placed within a unified framework, a framework that can be applied to empirical situations. In this paper we first identify four different theoretical concepts of interaction strength prevalent in the literature (community matrix, Jacobian matrix, inverse Jacobian, and removal matrix), showing how they are related to each other and how they are derived. We also demonstrate that their behavior is not necessarily concordant; hence it is important to identify clearly which concept of interaction strength is being discussed. Then we evaluate several observational and experimental approaches to estimating interaction strength empirically, highlighting their ties to theory, if any, and the limitations and strengths of each approach. Finally, we apply several techniques to a simulated data set, based on an intertidal community, evaluating both accuracy and logistical ease of these approaches. We find that per capita interaction strength is often the most useful index to measure, that caution must be exercised in interpreting empirical estimates of interaction strength because of equilibrium assumptions and the potential confounding effect of indirect effects, and that concentrating on evaluating the relationship between empirically observed rates of change and species abundances may be a profitable way to proceed.","Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA; Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Laska, MS (corresponding author), Laska Ecol Consulting Serv, 200 W 93rd St,Suite 5C, New York, NY 10025 USA.",,"Wootton, J.

The model makes a number of qualitative predictions about population structure. At small scales, areas of high settlement should have on average less free space and fewer cohorts. At a larger unspecified scale (>34.6 cm(2)) cohort structure should be more variable in areas of high settlement. We attempted to test these qualitative predictions on a number of different spatial scales using the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides. A recruitment gradient was defined for S. balanoides around the coast of Anglesey, Wales, with the north having lower recruitment than the south regardless of year. Given this recruitment gradient, a nested ANOVA was used to examine the qualitative predictions of the demographic model at different scales. The qualitative predictions of the demographic model were not generally supported by an analysis of data from Anglesey. Free space and small-scale population variance did not vary between areas of different recruitment density. Barnacle size variation was greater on high recruitment shores at an intermediate scale (100 m) as predicted by the model. However, this difference was not statistically significant. Even at the scale of individual 5 x 5 cm photographs there was no evidence of a positive relationship between barnacle size variance and free space. Possible reasons for the mismatch of the demographic model predictions and empirical observations are discussed. There may be insufficient spatial sampling, insufficient recruitment difference, large-scale variation in mortality and growth rates, or the model assumptions may be incorrect. One important difference between the 2 levels of recruitment is that low recruitment sites had a constant patch size below 25 cm(2), whereas the high recruitment sites did not. If patch scale is variable, the predictions of the demographic model will be irrelevant as there is no single scale at which they can be observed. Use of the nested ANOVA technique with logarithmic spatial scales also allows hypotheses to be made about the important spatial scales for future demographic studies using manipulative experiments. For population variance, free space and opercular length the important scales were small (<1 m), meso- (100 m), and large scales (>10 km).","Univ Southampton, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England; Univ Strathclyde, Dept Stat & Modelling Sci, Glasgow G1 1XH, Lanark, Scotland","Hyder, K (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Bassett Crescent E, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England.",kieran@soton.ac.uk,"Johnson, Mark/W-4226-2019; Johnson, Mark P/B-5017-2009","Johnson, Mark/0000-0002-5078-1410; Johnson, Mark P/0000-0002-5078-1410; Hyder, Kieran/0000-0003-1428-5679",,,,66,19,19,0,8,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Previous theories advanced to explain mammal declines in Australia have not achieved wide acceptance or provided the confidence for initiation of general recovery programmes. This study examined univariate and multivariate associations between conilurine decline and a range of life history (body size, biogeographic province, habitat preference, diet, use of shelter and refuges, reproductive potential, population stability, and rainfall) and land-use parameters (abundance of the introduced fox Vulpes vulpes, cat Felis cattus, rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, and domestic stock). Life history associations included an increase in range decline with increasing body size; move severe decline in the avid centre and temperate woodlands; less severe decline in species which have high reproductive rates and those which use shelter (burrows and natural cavities); and a more severe decline in species with a high proportion of leaf/stem in their diets. Declines were most severe in areas where rabbits and foxes were abundant and less severe in areas where dingoes were abundant. The abundance of the cat was the best predictor of decline in small conilurines (<35 g), and in conilurines of all sizes where foxes and rabbits are scarce or absent. An 'hyperpredation' hypothesis is advanced to account for these patterns. Declines have been most severe in areas where predator abundance (cat, fox, dingo Canis familiaris dingo) has been greatly elevated and sustained by the introduction of rabbits and mice. Cats and foxes ave also associated with severe declines in species with low reproductive rates in areas where rabbits and mice are scarce or absent and where habitats may have been modified by grazing or frequent burning. Rabbit control, construction of small predator-proof fenced enclosures around core breeding populations, and continued transfer of endangered fauna to predator-free islands ave advocated to facilitate conilurine recovery.

The Great Lakes contain numerous potential predators of lake trout eggs and fry, some of which are recent invaders, and most of which were probably absent when lake trout most recently re-invaded the Great Lakes after the last ice age. Simple quantitative models of predation suggest that plausible assumptions about prey densities, predator feeding rates, and duration of exposure of predator to prey can lead to very high estimates of predation mortality, in some instances approaching 100%. Indirect evidence from inter-Great Lake comparisons and inland lake examples also suggest that biotic factors may impede successful lake trout colonization. Our synthesis of the evidence leads to recommendations for research to better define field feeding rates of lake trout egg and fry predators and comparative studies of densities of potential egg and fry predators on lake trout spawning reefs. Management options should be designed to provide useful information as well as achieve short-term goals. From a management standpoint we recommend that: newly constructed lake trout reefs should be placed well away from concentrations of potential predators; offshore spawning reefs should be stocked; salmonine stocking, nutrient abatement, and commercial harvest of alewives should all be considered as options to enhance survival of young lake trout; hatchery lake trout should nor be stocked at sites where wild lake trout are showing signs of recovery; and exotic species expansions or introductions must be curtailed to maintain or improve on our recent successes in lake trout rehabilitation.","NATL BIOL SERV,GREAT LAKES SCI CTR,ANN ARBOR,MI 48105; ONTARIO MINIST NAT RESOURCES,MAPLE,ON L6A 1S9,CANADA; NATL BIOL SERV,GREAT LAKES SCI CTR,LAKE SUPERIOR BIOL STN,ASHLAND,WI 54806; LOYOLA UNIV,DEPT BIOL,CHICAGO,IL 60626; UNIV MICHIGAN,CTR GREAT LAKES & AQUAT SCI,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109; NATL BIOL SERV,GREAT LAKES CTR,LAKE ONTARIO BIOL STN,OSWEGO,NY 13126","Jones, ML (corresponding author), ONTARIO MINIST NAT RESOURCES,AQUAT ECOSYST RES,RURAL ROUTE 4,PICTON,ON K0K 2T0,CANADA.",,,"Hudson, Patrick/0000-0002-7646-443X",,,,80,45,46,1,27,INT ASSOC GREAT LAKES RES,ANN ARBOR,"2200 BONISTEEL BLVD, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109-2099",0380-1330,,,J GREAT LAKES RES,J.

In some studies, understory grassland productivity was < 25% of open grassland productivity, whereas in other studies understory productivity exceeded 200% of that of surrounding grassland. We examined light, temperature, soil nutrients, soil moisture, and fine tree root distributions under selected Q. douglasii trees (12 that appeared to have suppressive effects on understory productivity, and 12 that appeared to enhance understory productivity) in order to determine how variations in these factors were associated with the differences in understory grassland productivities. We found that grassland productivity is likely to be facilitated by nutrient inputs via litterfall and throughfall under all trees, but that trees with low understory grassland productivities had substantially higher amounts of fine roots in the upper 50 cm of soil and much lower predawn xylem pressure potentials than trees with high understory productivities and presumably deeper root systems. Root exclosures reduced the negative effects of these trees on the dominant understory grass species, and further experiments indicated that the negative effects of the tree roots may partially result from allelopathic oak root exudates. Thus, shallow fine tree roots may inhibit understory productivity, and variations in Q. douglasii root morphology may explain the intertree variations in facilitating/interfering effects on understory species.","MARIE SELBY BOT GARDEN, SARASOTA, FL 34236 USA","CALLAWAY, RM (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT BIOL SCI, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA.",,,,,,,41,277,281,2,78,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,1991,72,4,,,,,1484,1499,,10.2307/1941122,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GB185,WOS:A1991GB18500033,,,,,2021-09-21,

The quality of urban greenery, resistance to negative climate change factors and pollution, as well as efficiency of short-rotation forestry in suburban areas, depends primarily on the selection of hybrids and clones, suitable for the local environmental conditions. We postulate that ecogenetic response, phenotypic plasticity, and genotypic variation of hybrid poplars (Populus L.) grown in plantations are affected not only by the peculiarities of hybrids and clones, but also by environmental conditions of their vegetative propagation. The aim of the present study was to estimate growth and biochemical responses, the phenotypic plasticity, genotypic variation of adaptive traits, and genetically regulated adaptability of Populus hybrids in field trials which may be predisposed by the simulated contrasting temperature conditions at their vegetative propagation phase. The research was performed with the 20 cultivars and experimental clones of one intraspecific cross and four different interspecific hybrids of poplars propagated under six contrasting temperature regimes in phytotron. The results suggest that certain environmental conditions during vegetative propagation not only have a short-term effect on tree viability and growth, but also can help to adapt to climate change conditions and grow successfully in the long-term. It was found that tree growth and biochemical traits (the chlorophyll A and B, pigments content and the chlorophyll A/B ratio) of hybrid poplar clones grown in field trials, as well as their traits' genetic parameters, were affected by the rooting-growing conditions during vegetative propagation phase. Hybrids P. balsamifera x P. trichocarpa, and P. trichocarpa x P. trichocarpa have shown the most substantial changes of biochemical traits across vegetative propagation treatments in field trial. Rooting-growing conditions during vegetative propagation had also an impact on coefficients of genotypic variation and heritability in hybrid poplar clones when grown in field trials.","[Gudynaite-Franckeviciene, Valda; Pliura, Alfas] Lithuanian Res Ctr Agr & Forestry, Liepu St 1, LT-53101 Kaunas, Lithuania","Gudynaite-Franckeviciene, V (corresponding author), Lithuanian Res Ctr Agr & Forestry, Liepu St 1, LT-53101 Kaunas, Lithuania.",Valda.Gudynaite-Franckeviciene@lammc.lt; Alfas.Pliura@lammc.lt,,,"European Social Fund under the Development of Competences of Scientists, other Researchers and Students through Practical Research Activities project [09.3.3-LMT-K-712]","This research was supported by the European Social Fund under the Development of Competences of Scientists, other Researchers and Students through Practical Research Activities project No 09.3.3-LMT-K-712.",,67,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-4907,,FORESTS,Forests,JUL,2021,12,7,,,,,,,892,10.3390/f12070892,,,18,Forestry,Forestry,TN3UN,WOS:000676163700001,,gold,,,2021-09-21,

Here we studied the effects on community growth and microbial diversity as a function of environmental connectivity, where we define environmental connectivity as the degree of habitat fragmentation preventing microbial cells from living together. We quantitatively compared growth of a naturally-derived high microbial diversity community from soil in a completely mixed liquid suspension (high connectivity) to growth in a massively fragmented and poorly connected environment (low connectivity). The low connectivity environment consisted of homogenously-sized miniature agarose beads containing random single or paired founder cells. We found that overall community growth was the same in both environments, but the low connectivity environment dramatically reduced global community-level diversity compared to the high connectivity environment. Experimental observations were supported by community growth modeling. The model predicts a loss of diversity in the low connectivity environment as a result of negative interspecific interactions becoming more dominant at small founder species numbers. Counterintuitively for the low connectivity environment, growth of isolated single genotypes was less productive than that of random founder genotype cell pairs, suggesting that the community as a whole profited from emerging positive interspecific interactions. Our work demonstrates the importance of environmental connectivity for growth of natural soil microbial communities, which aids future efforts to intervene in or restore community composition to achieve engineering and biotechnological objectives. Manupriyam Dubey et al. use experimental systems with naturally derived soil microbiomes in liquid suspensions and encapsulated beads to compare community dynamics in well-connected and poorly connected environments. While their results show that microbial growth does not vary between conditions, they report that low connectivity led to reduced microbial diversity and suggest that these reductions in microbial diversity may be due to increased negative interspecific interactions.","[Dubey, Manupriyam; Hadadi, Noushin; Pelet, Serge; Carraro, Nicolas; van der Meer, Jan R.] Univ Lausanne, Dept Fundamental Microbiol, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Johnson, David R.] Eawag, Dept Environm Microbiol, Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dubendorf, Switzerland","van der Meer, JR (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Fundamental Microbiol, Lausanne, Switzerland.",janroelof.vandermeer@unil.ch,"van der Meer, Jan Roelof/G-6610-2012; Hadadi, Noushin/S-3193-2017","van der Meer, Jan Roelof/0000-0003-1485-3082; Hadadi, Noushin/0000-0001-6614-4910; Carraro, Nicolas/0000-0001-6364-547X; Pelet, Serge/0000-0002-0245-049X; Johnson, David/0000-0002-6728-8462; Dubey, Manupriyam/0000-0002-6909-0310",SystemsX.ch; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [2013/158]; National Centre in Competence Research in Microbiomes,"This work was supported by SystemsX.ch, and evaluated by the Swiss National Science Foundation, within grant 2013/158 (Design and Systems Biology of Functional Microbial Landscapes MicroScapesX), and by the National Centre in Competence Research in Microbiomes.

Many waterbirds visit both agricultural and natural landscapes during their daily movements, but potential bird-mediated dispersal of weed plants within and from agricultural landscapes to other habitats is commonly overlooked. Gulls (Laridae) are expanding in numbers and increasingly exploiting anthropogenic habitats worldwide, with possible growing implications for the spread of weeds. Yet, to date, there are no studies on the spatial distribution of weed dispersal by waterbirds. We developed a plant dispersal model based on movements of 19 Larus fuscus using ricefields, via GPS telemetry. We combined daily movements with two curves estimating the retention times of plant seeds in their guts: (a) an experimental curve based on retention time in captivity for four weeds with dry fruits known to be dispersed by gulls: Juncus bufonius, Cyperus difformis, Polypogon monspeliensis and the alien Amaranthus retroflexus; (b) a theoretical curve based on the interspecific scaling relationship between body mass and mean retention time. Median dispersal distances of weed plant seeds by gulls ranged between 690 and 940 m, but maximum distances exceeded 150 km. The theoretical retention time model showed higher median dispersal distances than the experimental retention time model. Spatial patterns of weed deposition were very similar between retention time methods, and most strongly depended on gull movements. Variation between individual gulls had little influence on seed shadows. About 92% of all seeds (>10,000 intact seeds per day) were dispersed within the ricefield area of 370 km(2). The remaining 8% of seeds were deposited beyond ricefields into other habitats, 42% of which reached moist environments (other irrigated agriculture, rivers and natural wetlands) presumably suitable for weed establishment. Synthesis. Gulls can disperse weed plants over long distances across a mosaic of habitats. This implies exchange of weed plant species between human-dominated and natural areas by waterbirds as dispersal vectors. This spatial study highlights the importance of non-frugivorous birds for long-distance plant dispersal, which is generally an overlooked mechanism in studies aiming to predict and manage expansion of weed plants.","[Martin-Velez, Victor; Green, Andy J.] Estn Biol Donana EBD CSIC, Dept Wetland Ecol, Seville, Spain; [van Leeuwen, Casper H.

On the other hand, information is lacking to predict under what alternate trophic conditions coexistence may occur. Comparing diets of native yellow perch Perca flavescens and nonindigenous white perch Morone americana, we examined variation in resource partitioning and body condition across a prominent longitudinal nutrient gradient in Lake Erie (north-eastern United States, Canada). As measured with Analysis of Similarity and Schoener's index, diet similarity declined monotonically from west to east tracking declines in nutrients, productivity and relative abundance of both species. Additionally, diet similarity increased from spring through fall, following seasonal development of stratification and hypolimnetic hypoxia-phenomena which tend to increase spatial overlap between these species. Finally, relative weights of both species peaked in the Central Basin (relative weights > 0.85), which, on average, had intermediate values of prey diversity, ecosystem trophic status and water clarity. Our results highlight that native yellow perch coexist with invasive white perch under a wide range of trophic conditions. Of importance to fishery managers, mesotrophy in the Central Basin correlated with the highest body conditions and intermediate prey resource partitioning, although the effect size was small and variable. While competitive exclusion appears unlikely, the goal of reducing nutrient inputs in Lake Erie could affect not only the distributions of both species but also stakeholder decisions about where to fish.","[Kraus, Richard T.; Schmitt, Joseph D.; Keretz, Kevin R.] US Geol Survey, Great Lakes Sci Ctr, Lake Erie Biol Stn, 6100 Columbus Ave, Sandusky, OH 44870 USA","Kraus, RT (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Great Lakes Sci Ctr, Lake Erie Biol Stn, 6100 Columbus Ave, Sandusky, OH 44870 USA.",rkraus@usgs.gov,"Schmitt, Joseph/AAC-3110-2021","Schmitt, Joseph/0000-0002-8354-4067; Keretz, Kevin/0000-0002-4808-8350; Kraus, Richard/0000-0003-4494-1841",U.S. Department of Interior Northeast Climate Science Center; Upper Midwest Great Lakes Landscape Conservation Cooperative,U.S. Department of Interior Northeast Climate Science Center; Upper Midwest Great Lakes Landscape Conservation Cooperative.,,127,0,0,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

Heterotrophic sessile marine invertebrate communities are extremely diverse but traditionally, space was viewed as the sole limiting resource. Recently planktonic food was recognized as an additional limiting resource, but the degree to which planktonic food acts as a single resource or is utilized differentially remains unclear. In other words, whether planktonic food represents a single resource niche or multiple resource niches has not been established. We estimated the rate at which 11 species of marine invertebrates consumed three phytoplankton species, each different in shape and size. Rates of consumption varied by a 240-fold difference among the species considered and, while there was overlap in the consumer diets, we found evidence for differential resource usage (i.e. consumption rates of phytoplankton differed among consumers). No consumer ingested all phytoplankton species at equivalent rates, instead most species tended to consume one of the species much more than others. Our results suggest that utilization of the phytoplankton niche by filter feeders is more subdivided than previously thought, and resource specialization may facilitate coexistence in this system. Our results provide a putative mechanism for why diversity affects community function and invasion in a classic system for studying competition.","[Comerford, Belinda; Alvarez-Noriega, Mariana; Marshall, Dustin] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Ecol Evolutionary Grp, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Alvarez-Noriega, Mariana; Marshall, Dustin] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Geometr Biol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Comerford, B (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Ecol Evolutionary Grp, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",Belinda.comerford@monash.edu,,"Comerford, Belinda/0000-0003-0136-9291",,,,59,0,0,2,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,2020,194,3,,,,,505,513,,10.1007/s00442-020-04791-w,,OCT 2020,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ON9BG,WOS:000580503800003,33079267,,,,2021-09-21,

Understanding its genome organization (allohexaploid; AABBDD; 2n = 6x = 42) is essential for geneticists and plant breeders. Particularly, the knowledge of how homologous chromosomes (equivalent chromosomes from the same genome) specifically recognize each other to pair at the beginning of meiosis, the cellular process to generate gametes in sexually reproducing organisms, is fundamental for plant breeding and has a big influence on the fertility of wheat plants. Initial homologous chromosome interactions contribute to specific recognition and pairing between homologues at the onset of meiosis. Understanding the molecular basis of these critical processes can help to develop genetic tools in a breeding context to promote interspecific chromosome associations in hybrids or interspecific genetic crosses to facilitate the transfer of desirable agronomic traits from related species into a crop like wheat. The terminal regions of chromosomes, which include telomeres and subtelomeres, participate in chromosome recognition and pairing. We present a detailed molecular analysis of subtelomeres of wheat chromosome arms 1AS, 4AS, 7AS, 7BS and 7DS. Results showed a high polymorphism in the subtelomeric region among homoeologues (equivalent chromosomes from related genomes) for all the features analyzed, including genes, transposable elements, repeats, GC content, predicted CpG islands, recombination hotspots and targeted sequence motifs for relevant DNA-binding proteins. These polymorphisms might be the molecular basis for the specificity of homologous recognition and pairing in initial chromosome interactions at the beginning of meiosis in wheat.","[Aguilar, Miguel] Univ Cordoba, Area Fisiol Vegetal, Campus Rabanales,Edif C4,3a Planta, Cordoba, Spain; [Prieto, Pilar] CSIC, Agencia Estatal, Inst Sustainable Agr, Plant Breeding Dept, Alameda Obispo S-N,Apartado 4084, Cordoba 14080, Spain","Prieto, P (corresponding author), CSIC, Agencia Estatal, Inst Sustainable Agr, Plant Breeding Dept, Alameda Obispo S-N,Apartado 4084, Cordoba 14080, Spain.",pilar.prieto@ias.csic.es,"Prieto, Pilar/N-6394-2014","Prieto, Pilar/0000-0002-8160-808X",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO) [AGL2015-64833R]; European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) from the European Union,"Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO), Grant number: AGL2015-64833R, and The European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) from the European Union",,127,3,3,2,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,1940-3372,,PLANT GENOME-US,Plant Genome,NOV,2020,13,3,,,,,,,e20065,10.1002/tpg2.20065,,OCT 2020,22,Plant Sciences; Genetics & Heredity,Plant Sciences; Genetics & Heredity,PA5WY,WOS:000576360800001,33029942,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-21,

Nevertheless, performance and especially the percentage of each species at harvest are often considered highly variable. Nitrogen (N) fertilisation can be a relevant driving factor affecting the percentage of each species at harvest. Soil N availability influences competition for light and nitrogen in cereal-legume intercrops. However, management of N fertilisation still remains unclear for intercrops. Few references on the effects of a range of strategies of N fertilisation are available to guide farmers with relevant decision rules considering their expectations. Here, a modelling approach was proposed to simulate interactions between light and N acquisition of a pea-wheat intercrop and to test different scenarios for the management of such intercrops. A model (Azodyn-IC) was built resulting from the combination of two existing individual-crop models (AZODYN and AFISOL) and by applying rules of light and soil inorganic nitrogen sharing between the intercropped pea and wheat. Evaluation of the model outputs with experimental data showed satisfactory predictions of the studied variables (N accumulation, LAI, and crop dry weight). The model validated both resource sharing and light-N interactions. Furthermore, the model was able to respond to increases in inorganic N availability based upon straightforward formalisms. Simulating unmeasured variables, such as root growth and light interception and use by each species, improved our understanding of the relative dominance of each species for acquiring resources. Eventually, the model was used to simulate different scenarios of N fertilisation over 26 years of climatic data to account for climatic variability. We demonstrated the interest of such a modelling approach to design decision rules of N fertilisation according to farmers' expectations.","[Malagoli, Philippe; Naudin, Christophe; Corre-Hellou, Guenaelle] Ecole Super Agr, Legumineuses Ecophysiol Vegetale Agroecol LEVA, USC ESA INRAE 1432, 55 Rue Rabelais,BP 30748, F-49007 Angers, France; [Vrignon-Brenas, Sylvain] Univ Montpellier INRAE, Inst Agro, UMR LEPSE, Montpellier, France; [Sester, Mathilde] Univ Montpellier, UPR AIDA, CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Jeuffroy, Marie-Helene] AgroParisTech, UMR 211, Agron, INRAE, BP 01, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Malagoli, Philippe] INRAE, UMR PIAF, UCA, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France","Corre-Hellou, G (corresponding author), Ecole Super Agr, Legumineuses Ecophysiol Vegetale Agroecol LEVA, USC ESA INRAE 1432, 55 Rue Rabelais,BP 30748, F-49007 Angers, France.",g.hellou@groupe-esa.com,"NAUDIN, Christophe/A-2841-2014","NAUDIN, Christophe/0000-0003-1674-0241; Corre-Hellou, Guenaelle/0000-0002-3959-6214; Malagoli, Philippe/0000-0003-2422-9857","ADEME (Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie, France); Conseil General of Maine-et-Loire; UNIP (Union National des plantes riches en Proteines, France)","This work was jointly funded by ADEME (Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie, France), CASDAR no431 (Compte d'Affectation Speciale pour le Developpement Agricole et Rural, France), Conseil General of Maine-et-Loire, and UNIP (Union National des plantes riches en Proteines, France).",,59,2,2,5,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-4290,1872-6852,,FIELD CROP RES,Field Crop.

This phenomenon has been documented in temperate North America, but not at subtropical latitudes where temperatures are less extreme. To understand how temperature structures the size, richness, flocking propensity, and species interactions of subtropical mixed-species flocks, we performed paired mixed-species flock and point count surveys in upland hardwood forests in north-central Florida, USA. We described the composition of 92 mixed-species flocks across a similar to 20 degrees C range of daytime temperatures, using linear mixed models and network analyses to test for effects of temperature. We found that both flock species richness and size were significantly smaller at higher temperatures while statistically controlling for effects of time of day, canopy height, and local site effects. Thirteen of 14 flocking species showed decreases in within-flock abundance with increasing temperature, although this effect was only significant for the nuclear Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). Flock composition and species flocking propensities were less plastic than in temperate systems. By comparing metrics from 7 social networks corresponding to temperature ranges, we found that strength of flocking interactions was lower and that species were significantly less likely to co-occur with similarly foraging species at temperatures above 20 degrees C. Flocking propensities were lower for many species in the warmest temperature range. Thirteen of 14 species joined flocks in all 7 networks, and dissimilarity of social networks was consequently best explained by changes in species co-occurrence patterns rather than species turnover within flocks. In contrast to boreal flocking systems, changes to flocking behavior were prompted by unseasonably warm weather rather than cold spells, which suggests that warming winter temperatures could lead to breakdown of social behaviors in our system.","[Jones, Harrison H.; Walters, Mitchell J.; Robinson, Scott K.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Jones, Harrison H.; Walters, Mitchell J.; Robinson, Scott K.] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Jones, HH (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.; Jones, HH (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",harrisonhjones@ufl.edu,,,,,,103,0,0,3,3,WILSON ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC,WACO,"5400 BOSQUE BLVD, STE 680, WACO, TX 76710 USA",1559-4491,1938-5447,,WILSON J ORNITHOL,Wilson J.

Their unique pigments and safe cavity nesting habits are two potential explanations for their colourful character. However, plumage colour varies substantially between parrot species and sometimes also between males and females of the same species. Here, we use comparative analyses to evaluate what factors correlate with colour elaboration, colour diversity and sexual dichromatism. Specifically, we test the association between different aspects of parrot colouration and (a) the intensity of sexual selection and social interactions, (b) variation along the slow-fast life-history continuum and (c) climatic variation. We show that larger species and species that live in warm environments display more elaborated colours, yet smaller species have higher levels of sexual dichromatism. Larger parrots tend to have darker and more blue and red colours. Parrots that live in wetter environments are darker and redder, whereas species inhabiting warm regions have more blue plumage colours. In general, each of the variables we considered explain small to moderate amounts of variation in parrot colouration (up to 15%). Our data suggest that sexual selection may be acting more strongly on males in small, short-lived parrots leading to sexual dichromatism. More elaborate colouration in both males and females of the larger, long-lived species with slow tropical life histories suggests that mutual mate choice, social selection and reduced selection for crypsis may be important in these species, as has been shown for passerines.","[Carballo, Luisana; Delhey, Kaspar; Valcu, Mihai; Kempenaers, Bart] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany; [Delhey, Kaspar] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia","Carballo, L (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany.",lcarballo@orn.mpg.de,"Valcu, Mihai/AAX-8842-2021; Delhey, Kaspar/AAZ-5362-2020","Valcu, Mihai/0000-0002-6907-7802; Delhey, Kaspar/0000-0001-5190-5406; Kempenaers, Bart/0000-0002-7505-5458",Max-Planck-GesellschaftMax Planck Society,Max-Planck-Gesellschaft,,87,0,0,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1010-061X,1420-9101,,J EVOLUTION BIOL,J.

In this study, one-on-one interspecific interactions between two model brown rot (carbohydrate-selective) fungi,Gloeophyllum trabeumandRhodonia(Postia)placenta, were studied on wood wafers where a clearly resolved interaction zone (IZ) could be generated, reproducibly. Comparative RNAseq and proteomics between the IZ and non-interacting hyphae of each species identified combative strategies for each fungus. Glycoside hydrolases were a relatively smaller portion of the interaction secretome compared to non-interacting hyphae. The interaction zone showed higher pectinase specific activity than all other sampling locations, and higher laminarinase specific activity (branched beta-glucan proxy) was seen in the IZ secretome relative to equivalent hyphae in single-species cultures. Our efforts also identified two distinct competitive strategies in these two fungi with a shared nutritional mode (brown rot) but polyphyletic ancestral lineages.Gloeophyllum trabeum(Gloeophyllum clade) upregulated more secondary metabolite (SM) synthesis genes in response to a competitor than didR. placenta.R. placenta(Antrodia clade) upregulated a larger variety of uncharacterized oxidoreductases in interacting hyphae, suggesting that these may play a role in mediating competitor response in this fungus. Both species produced several hypothetical proteins exclusively in the interaction zone, leaving questions as to the function of these proteins. This work supports the existence of multiple interaction strategies among brown rot fungi and highlights the functional diversity among wood decay fungi.","[Presley, Gerald N.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Wood Sci & Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Zhang, Jiwei] Univ Minnesota, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst Engn, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Purvine, Samuel O.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Environm Mol Sci Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Schilling, Jonathan S.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Presley, GN (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Wood Sci & Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",gerald.presley@oregonstate.edu,,,U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of ScienceUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0004012]; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Biological and Ecological Research (BER)United States Department of Energy (DOE); U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) BERUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0012742]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Programs [00039202],"This work was funded in part by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science (Early Career Grant DE-SC0004012 to JS, from the Office of Biological and Ecological Research (BER) and BER Grant DE-SC0012742 to JS and Ellen Panisko.

Owing to past emissions and climate system inertia, global climate change is predicted to continue for decades even if anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions were to stop immediately. In many regions, such as central Europe and the Mediterranean region, the temperature is likely to rise by 2-5 degrees C and annual precipitation is predicted to decrease. Expected heat and drought periods followed by floods, and unpredictable growing seasons, are predicted to have detrimental effects on agricultural production systems, causing immense economic losses and food supply problems. To mitigate the risks of climate change, agricultural innovations counteracting these effects need to be embraced and accelerated. To achieve maximum improvement, the required agricultural innovations should not focus only on crops but rather pursue a holistic approach including the entire ecosystem. Over millions of years, plants have evolved in close association with other organisms, particularly soil microbes that have shaped their evolution and contemporary ecology. Many studies have already highlighted beneficial interactions among plants and the communities of microorganisms with which they coexist. Questions arising from these discoveries are whether it will be possible to decipher a common molecular pattern and the underlying biochemical framework of interspecies communication, and whether such knowledge can be used to improve agricultural performance under environmental stress conditions. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of plant interactions with fungal endosymbionts found in extreme ecosystems. Special attention will be paid to the interaction of plants with the symbiotic root-colonizing endophytic fungus Serendipita indica, which has been developed as a model system for beneficial plant-fungus interactions.","[Perez-Alonso, Marta-Marina; Guerrero-Galan, Carmen; Vicente-Carbajosa, Jesus; Pollmann, Stephan] Univ Politecn Madrid UPM, Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentac INIA, Ctr Biotecnol & Gen Plantas, Campus Montegancedo, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Scholz, Sandra S.; Oelmueller, Ralf] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Matthias Schleiden Inst Genet Bioinformat & Mol B, Dept Plant Physiol, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Kiba, Takatoshi; Sakakibara, Hitoshi] RIKEN, Ctr Sustainable Resource Sci, Tsurumi Ku, 1-7-22 Suehiro, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Kiba, Takatoshi; Sakakibara, Hitoshi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Dept Appl Biosci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Ludwig-Mueller, Jutta] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Bot, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Krapp, Anne] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, AgroParisTech, Inst Jean Pierre Bourgin,INRA, F-78000 Versailles, France; [Vicente-Carbajosa, Jesus; Pollmann, Stephan] Univ Politecn Madrid UPM, Dept Biotecnol Biol Vegetal, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Agron Alimentaria & Biosi, Madrid 28040, Spain","Pollmann, S (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid UPM, Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentac INIA, Ctr Biotecnol & Gen Plantas, Campus Montegancedo, Madrid 28223, Spain.; Pollmann, S (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid UPM, Dept Biotecnol Biol Vegetal, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Agron Alimentaria & Biosi, Madrid 28040, Spain.",stephan.pollmann@upm.es,"Pollmann, Stephan/ABC-8203-2020; Kiba, Takatoshi/A-1615-2011; Krapp, Anne/E-8372-2013; Alonso, Marta-Marina Perez/AAJ-4923-2020; Sakakibara, Hitoshi/A-6040-2010; Pollmann, Stephan/C-2776-2009; Vicente-Carbajosa, Jesus/A-9368-2008","Pollmann, Stephan/0000-0002-5111-4425; Kiba, Takatoshi/0000-0001-8651-0404; Krapp, Anne/0000-0003-2034-5615; Alonso, Marta-Marina Perez/0000-0003-4118-4822; Sakakibara, Hitoshi/0000-0001-5449-6492; Pollmann, Stephan/0000-0002-5111-4425; Guerrero-Galan, Carmen/0000-0003-2066-9230; Scholz, Sandra/0000-0002-5389-5296; Vicente-Carbajosa, Jesus/0000-0002-6332-1712","Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO), Spain [PCIN-2016037]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), GermanyFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01DR17007A, 01DR17007B]; Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST) [JPMJSC16C3]; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), FranceCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) [EIG_JC1JAPAN-045]; Severo Ochoa Program for Centers of Excellence in R&D from the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion, Spain [SEV-2016-0672]","The authors are grateful for financial assistance received from the collaborative IPSC research project realized in the framework of the EIG CONCERT-Japan joint call on Food Crops and Biomass Production Technologies and the related national funding agencies:grant PCIN-2016037 from the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO), Spain, to SP and JVC; grants 01DR17007A and 01DR17007B from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany, to JL-M and RO, respectively; grant JPMJSC16C3 from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) to HS; and grant EIG_JC1JAPAN-045 from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), France, to AK.

Several hypotheses tested patterns of biotic interactions' intensity along latitude. Negative interactions (i.e. competition and predation) are expected to be among the processes that produce checkerboard distribution of species. However, no relationship between checkerboardness and latitude has been uncovered. We tested Odonata assemblages worldwide for segregation patterns using a faunistic dataset (395 species arranged in 386 natural communities) spanning a wide latitudinal range (87 degrees). We used co-occurrence analyses (C-score index and Standardized Effect Size) as an estimate of checkerboardness then correlated the occurrence of segregation to latitude. Odonata followed the Latitudinal Diversity Gradient at the regional scale (i.e. country scale) within our analyzed assemblages spanning, whereas local richness (i.e. community scale) did not follow the same pattern. Odonata assemblages structured with segregation are more common going from high to low latitudes, and local species richness have no effect on the pattern. We summarized hypotheses on how biotic interactions or ecological and historical processes can influence the spatial patterns in the checkerboards of assemblages and presented promising ways to help to gain a better mechanistic understanding of the drivers of the Latitudinal Diversity Gradient.","[Cerini, Francesco; Stellati, Luca; Vignoli, Leonardo] Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Sci, Rome, Italy","Cerini, F (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Sci, Rome, Italy.",francesco.cerini@uniroma3.it,"Cerini, Francesco/AAO-8613-2020","Cerini, Francesco/0000-0002-1367-1239",,,,86,1,1,2,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,2020,194,1-2,,,,,15,25,,10.1007/s00442-020-04687-9,,JUN 2020,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OA9KW,WOS:000543627700001,32556555,,,,2021-09-21,

The extent to which species richness in local communities is related to larger-scale processes is a pre-eminent topic in ecological and evolutionary research. To investigate how local and regional species richness are related, we sampled freshwater turtle assemblages in seven localities to represent the variation in ecological conditions along a 90 km south-north megatransect in Benin, West Africa. In each locality, all turtles captured were identified and measured, and the microhabitat in which individual turtles were observed was classified. Based on these data, we used community diversity metrics to compare turtle assemblages. Spatial autocorrelation did not affect our data. For all localities pooled, two species (Pelusios castaneus and Pelomedusa olivacea) were the most common and one species (Trionyx triunguis) was the rarest. Analyses of the commonest and more numerous species showed that the abundance ofPelusios castaneus declined with an increase in latitude and longitude, but the opposite was true for Pelomedusa olivacea. We showed that various characteristics of the microhabitat were significantly correlated with the abundance of the two common species. We found significant but variable south-north gradients in microhabitat use for different turtle species. Our results highlight the importance of studying interactions between local environments, the ecological requirements of each species and their synecological relationships.","[Luiselli, Luca; Akani, Godfrey C.; Eniang, Edem A.; Dendi, Daniele; Hema, Emmanuel M.] Inst Dev Ecol Conservat & Cooperat, Rome, Italy; [Luiselli, Luca; Akani, Godfrey C.; Dendi, Daniele] Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl & Environm Biol, Port Harcourt, Nigeria; [Luiselli, Luca; Dendi, Daniele] Univ Lome, Fac Sci, Dept Zool & Biol Anim, Lome, Togo; [Ajong, Stephanie N.] Lagos State Univ, Dept Fisheries, Lagos, Nigeria; [George, Adedolapo] Lagos State Univ, Dept Zool & Environm Biol, Lagos, Nigeria; [Di Vittorio, Massimiliano; Petrozzi, Fabio] Ecol Applicata Italia, Palermo, Italy; [Eniang, Edem A.] Univ Uyo, Dept Forestry & Wildlife, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria; [Hema, Emmanuel M.] Univ Dedougou, UFR Sci Appl & Technol, Dedougou, Burkina Faso; [Hema, Emmanuel M.] Univ Ouaga I Prof Joseph Ki Zerbo, Lab Biol & Ecol Anim, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; [Fa, John E.] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Sci & Environm, Div Biol & Conservat Ecol, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Fa, John E.] CIFOR Headquarters, Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), Inst Dev Ecol Conservat & Cooperat, Rome, Italy.; Luiselli, L (corresponding author), Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl & Environm Biol, Port Harcourt, Nigeria.; Luiselli, L (corresponding author), Univ Lome, Fac Sci, Dept Zool & Biol Anim, Lome, Togo.",l.luiselli@ideccngo.org,"Dendi, Daniele/AAO-8569-2020","Dendi, Daniele/0000-0003-1417-9091",Turtle Conservation Fund [TCF 0039],This study was funded by the Turtle Conservation Fund (project number TCF 0039 to L.L.).

However, despite the growing information on the mechanisms underlying such a structure, it is still difficult to predict the functional consequences of species' structural positions in these networks. From the plant perspective, species position and roles in pollination networks might be related to traits describing flower attractiveness, availability and dependence on pollinators. In turn, both network metrics and plant traits might influence plant species fitness. During two field seasons, we collected data from the 23 most abundant plant species in a rich coastal community, to evaluate the association between population and floral traits (floral abundance at population level and flowers per individual, flower shape and size, flowering length, nectar volume, pollinator dependence), species-level network metrics (linkage level, specialization -d '-, weighted closeness centrality, network roles related to modularity) and plant fitness (seeds/flower, seed weight). Flowering length, flower size, flower abundance and pollinator dependence were positively related to greater generalization, as measured by various indices. More abundant species and those with larger flowers showed higher linkage levels (i.e. higher number of pollinator species), whereas longer flowering periods were negatively related to d ' and positively related to closeness centrality and important roles in the network. Likewise, plants species more dependent on pollinators occupied more central positions in the network. Furthermore, centrality in the networks was significantly associated with plant fitness. Specifically, central species in the network produced more and heavier seeds than the others. However, other plant traits, such as flower size and pollinator dependence had additional direct effects on seed production. Synthesis. Our study highlights how population and floral traits define the positions and roles of species structuring the pollination communities. Moreover, the relationships between network metrics and plant reproduction indicate, for the first time, the functional implications of these structural positions at the interspecific level of community assembly.","[Lazaro, Amparo; Gomez-Martinez, Carmelo; Alomar, David; Gonzalez-Estevez, Miguel A.; Traveset, Anna] IMEDEA UIB CSIC, Mediterranean Inst Adv Studies, Global Change Res Grp, Esporles, Spain","Lazaro, A (corresponding author), IMEDEA UIB CSIC, Mediterranean Inst Adv Studies, Global Change Res Grp, Esporles, Spain.",amparo.lazaro@imedea.uib-csic.es,"Lazaro, Amparo/ABG-4657-2020","Lazaro, Amparo/0000-0001-5626-4134","Regional Government of the Balearic Islands; European Social Fund 2014-2020European Social Fund (ESF); Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [RYC-2015-19034]; Spanish State Research Agency; European Social Funds (ESF invests in your future); University of the Balearic Islands; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2017-89254-R, CGL201788122-P]; Feder funds (Call 2017); programme `SOIB JOVE - QUALIFICATS' (SOIB i Garantia Juvenil)","We thank the taxonomists that helped with insect identifications: David Baldock (Hymenoptera in general), Lech Borowiec (Bruchidae), Jose Vicent Falco (Braconidae), Hans-Peter Tschorsnig (Tachinidae), Adrian Pont (Muscidae) and Martin J.

Laboratory experiments revealed that in general both parasitoids could not reliably differentiate between unparasitized and previously parasitized eggs whatever quality or combination was provided. This situation was beneficial for T. cacoeciae, as all eggs successfully parasitized by both parasitoids developed solely into T. cacoeciae adults. Nonetheless, the latter's parasitism rate was much lower in the case of simultaneous presence of a A. quadridentata female than alone showing A. quadridentata capability to defend its own offspring. Although further tests under more natural conditions are necessary, this study suggests that regarding control of the codling moth, inundative releases of T. cacoeciae may disturb the natural control made by the endemic parasitoid A. quadridentata.","[Ksentini, Ines] Univ Sfax, Olive Tree Inst, Airport Rd Km 1-5,PB 1087, Sfax 3000, Tunisia; [Herz, Annette] Julius Kuhn Inst, Inst Biol Control, Heinrichstr 243, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany","Ksentini, I (corresponding author), Univ Sfax, Olive Tree Inst, Airport Rd Km 1-5,PB 1087, Sfax 3000, Tunisia.",ines.ksentini@gmail.com; Annette.Herz@julius-kuehn.de,,,Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) in GermanyDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD),"We thank the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) in Germany for financially supporting I.

Here, we develop a statistical model to quantify inter-annual variation in phenology and abundance over an environmental gradient, and use it to identify potential drivers of phenology and abundance in co-occurring species. We fit the model to counts of 10 butterfly species with single annual generations over a mountain elevation gradient, as an exemplar system in which temporally limited availability of biotic resources and favorable abiotic conditions impose narrow windows of seasonal activity. We estimate parameters describing changes in abundance, and the peak time and duration of the flight period, over ten years (2004-2013) and across twenty sample locations (930-2,050 m) in central Spain. We also use the model outputs to investigate relationships of phenology and abundance with temperature and rainfall. Annual shifts in phenology were remarkably consistent among species, typically showing earlier flight periods during years with warm conditions in March or May-June. In contrast, inter-annual variation in relative abundance was more variable among species, and generally less well associated with climatic conditions. Nevertheless, warmer temperatures in June were associated with increased relative population growth in three species, and five species had increased relative population growth in years with earlier flight periods. These results suggest that broadly coherent interspecific changes to phenology could help to maintain temporal synchrony in community dynamics under climate change, but that the relative composition of communities may vary due to interspecific inconsistency in population dynamic responses to climate change. However, it may still be possible to predict abundance change for species based on a robust understanding of relationships between their population dynamics and phenology, and the environmental drivers of both.","[Stewart, James E.; Wilson, Robert J.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; [Illan, Javier Gutierrez] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Richards, Shane A.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Gutierrez, David] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Area Biodiversidad & Conservat, E-28933 Madrid, Spain; [Wilson, Robert J.] CSIC, MNCN, Dept Biogeog & Cambio Global, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Stewart, JE (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",j.e.stewart8@gmail.com,"Gutierrez, David/P-4712-2014; Stewart, James Edward/Y-4867-2019; Wilson, Robert J/I-8726-2014","Gutierrez, David/0000-0002-8059-1239; Stewart, James Edward/0000-0003-4250-0073; Wilson, Robert J/0000-0003-4477-7068; Richards, Shane/0000-0002-9638-5827","Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L002434/1]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [REN2002-12853-E/GLO, CGL2005-06820/BOS, CGL2008-04950/BOS, CGL2011-30259]; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos/Comunidad de MadridComunidad de Madrid [URJC-CM-2006-CET-0592]; British Ecological Society; Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission [JP10052]; Natural Environment Research Council (UKPopNet)","S.

For this purpose, fish juveniles were consecutively fed with a standard and a marked diet (yttrium oxide) and were sampled at difference post-prandial times. Mathematical models were constructed to predict filling and evacuation of the stomach and intestine in gilthead seabream, and the whole digestive tract in Senegalese sole. Results demonstrated that changes in daily feeding time and frequency, modified the feed transit rate and residence time in the gut as well as the apparent digestibility, with obvious consequences for the utilization of nutrients. Variations in apparent digestibility were also observed along the daily cycle. Besides, the obtained response varied significantly depending on the studied fish species, due to the interspecific differences in the anatomy, digestive physiology, and feeding habits. Allocating the whole daily meal in one ration resulted in fast gut filling rate and low apparent digestibility in both species. In gilthead seabream, feeding protocol did not influence the stomach and intestine evacuation rates. However, in Senegalese sole, frequent meals during the whole daily cycle resulted in a faster gut evacuation. Very frequent diurnal feeding led to highest ADCs in both species; although, such higher digestibility values were not necessarily related to longer feed residence times within the gut in gilthead seabream. The results obtained from this study can be useful to establish optimized feeding protocols that help to reduce the production costs and undigested debris in the effluents.","[Gilannejad, Neda; Martinez-Rodriguez, Gonzalo; Yufera, Manuel] CSIC, Inst Ciencias Marinas Andalucia ICMAN, Puerto Real 11519, Spain; [Silva, Tome] SPAROS Lda, Area Empresarial Marim, P-8700221 Olhao, Portugal","Gilannejad, N (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencias Marinas Andalucia ICMAN, Puerto Real 11519, Spain.",neda.gilannejad@icman.csic.es,"MARTINEZ-RODRIGUEZ, GONZALO/A-2564-2009; Gilannejad, Neda/G-8096-2018","MARTINEZ-RODRIGUEZ, GONZALO/0000-0003-3379-580X; Gilannejad, Neda/0000-0003-0843-2484; Yufera, Manuel/0000-0003-2999-4611",Spanish Ministry of Economic Affairs and Competitiveness (MINECO) [AGL2014-52888-R]; FEDER/ERDF; WISEFEED - European Union's H2020 programme (Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant) [691150]; MINECO (Spain) [BES-2015-071662],This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economic Affairs and Competitiveness (MINECO) by projects EFISHDIGEST (AGL2014-52888-R) with FEDER/ERDF contribution granted to M.Y. and WISEFEED funded by the European Union's H2020 programme (Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant No 691150).

It is therefore often challenging to disentangle the factors affecting ecological traits like diet. Insular habitats provide a good opportunity to study how variation in diet originates, in particular in populations of mesopredators such as lizards. Indeed, high levels of population density associated with low food abundance and low predation are selection pressures typically observed on islands. In the present study, the diet of eighteen insular populations of two closely related species of lacertid lizards (Podarcis sicula and Podarcis melisellensis) was assessed. Our results reveal that despite dietary variability among populations, diet taxonomic diversity is not impacted by island area. In contrast, however, diet disparity metrics, based on the variability in the physical (hardness) and behavioral (evasiveness) properties of ingested food items, are correlated with island size. These findings suggest that an increase in intraspecific competition for access to resources may induce shifts in functional components of the diet. Additionally, the two species differed in the relation between diet disparity and island area suggesting that different strategies exist to deal with low food abundance in these two species. Finally, sexual dimorphism in diet and head dimensions is not greater on smaller islands, in contrast to our predictions.","[Taverne, Maxime; King-Gillies, Nina; Martin, Louise; Michal, Leslie; Vigliotti, Chloe; Herrel, Anthony] CNRS, UMR 7179, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Adaptat Vivant, Paris, France; [Fabre, Anne-Claire] Nat Hist Museum, Life Sci, London, England; [Krajnovic, Maria; Lisicic, Duje; Stambuk, Anamaria; Tadic, Zoran] Univ Zagreb, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Zagreb, Croatia; [Petricioli, Donat] DIIV Ltd Marine Freshwater & Subterranean Ecol, Sali, Croatia; [Wehrle, Beck A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92717 USA","Taverne, M (corresponding author), CNRS, UMR 7179, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Adaptat Vivant, Paris, France.",maxime.taverne@mnhn.fr,"Herrel, Anthony/C-3712-2013; Lisicic, Duje/AAG-7819-2019; Wehrle, Beck/AAG-3402-2021; Fabre, Anne-Claire/J-4492-2014; Taverne, Maxime/K-7564-2018","Herrel, Anthony/0000-0003-0991-4434; Lisicic, Duje/0000-0001-5587-6518; Fabre, Anne-Claire/0000-0001-7310-1775; Wehrle, Beck/0000-0002-1598-6656; Tadic, Zoran/0000-0002-7651-4425; Stambuk, Anamaria/0000-0002-3177-7694; Taverne, Maxime/0000-0003-3355-6200",National Geographic Committee for Research and ExplorationNational Geographic Society,National Geographic Committee for Research and Exploration,,82,4,4,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Presently, conservation research and actions focus predominantly on fragmentation caused directly by physical transformation of the landscape (e.g. deforestation, agriculture, urbanization, roads, etc.). While there is no doubt that landscape features play a key role in fragmenting populations or enhancing connectivity, fragmentation may also come about by processes other than the transformation of the landscape and which may not be readily visible. Such landscape-independent fragmentation (LIF) usually comes about when anthropogenic disturbance alters the inter- and intra-specific interactions among and within species. LIF and its drivers have received little attention in the scientific literature and in the management of wildlife populations. We discuss three major classes of LIF processes and their relevance for the conservation and management of species and habitats: (i) interspecific dispersal dependency, in which populations of species that rely on other species for transport and propagation become fragmented as the transporting species declines; (ii) interspecific avoidance induction, where species are excluded from habitats and corridors owing to interspecific interactions resulting from anthropogenically induced changes in community structure (e.g. exclusions by increased predation pressure); and (iii) intraspecific behavioural divergence, where populations become segregated owing to anthropogenically induced behavioural differentiation among them.

While this expansion threatens a smaller arctic ecological equivalent, the arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), the case became a textbook example of climate-driven range shifts. We tested this classical climate change hypothesis linked to an important range shift which has attracted little research thus far. We analysed Canadian fur harvest data from the Hudson's Bay Company Archives (14 trading posts; 1926-1950), testing hypotheses based on changes in summer and winter climates. Summer warming might have triggered a bottom-up increase in ecosystem productivity, while winter warming might have lowered thermal stress, both favouring red fox expansion. Additionally, we evaluated the hypothesis that red fox expansion was driven by the appearance of human sedentary sites (n = 110) likely bringing food subsidies into the unproductive tundra. Analysis of red fox expansion chronologies showed that expansion speed was higher during warmer winters. However, the expansions occurred under both cooling and warming trends, being faster during cooler summers in the Baffin Island region. The increasing proportion of red fox in fox fur harvests was best explained by human activity, while generalized linear mixed models also revealed a marginal effect of warmer winters. Generalized additive models confirmed human presence as the most important factor explaining rates of change in the proportion of red fox in fox fur harvests. Using historical ecology, we disentangled the relative influences of climate change and anthropogenic habitat change, two global drivers that transformed arctic biodiversity during the last century and will likely continue to do so during this century. Anthropogenic food subsidies, which constitute stable food sources, facilitated the invasion of the tundra biome by a new mammalian predator and competitor, with long-term consequences that still remain to be understood.","[Gallant, Daniel; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Chaire Rech Canada Biodiversite Nordique, Rimouski, PQ, Canada; [Gallant, Daniel; Berteaux, Dominique] Univ Quebec Rimouski, Ctr Etud Nordiques, Rimouski, PQ, Canada; [Gallant, Daniel; Lecomte, Nicolas] Univ Moncton, Chaire Rech Canada Ecol Polaire & Boreale, Moncton, NB, Canada; [Gallant, Daniel; Lecomte, Nicolas] Univ Moncton, Ctr Etud Nordiques, Moncton, NB, Canada; [Gallant, Daniel] Kouchibouguac Natl Pk Canada, Kouchibouguac, NB, Canada","Gallant, D (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Rimouski, Chaire Rech Canada Biodiversite Nordique, Rimouski, PQ, Canada.; Gallant, D (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Rimouski, Ctr Etud Nordiques, Rimouski, PQ, Canada.; Gallant, D (corresponding author), Univ Moncton, Chaire Rech Canada Ecol Polaire & Boreale, Moncton, NB, Canada.; Gallant, D (corresponding author), Univ Moncton, Ctr Etud Nordiques, Moncton, NB, Canada.",daniel.gallant@canada.ca,"Gallant, Daniel/B-9118-2015; Berteaux, Dominique/J-3276-2016","Gallant, Daniel/0000-0002-3170-0523; Berteaux, Dominique/0000-0003-2728-5985; Lecomte, Nicolas/0000-0002-8473-5375",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; International Polar Year Program of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada; ArcticNet Network of Centres of Excellence of Canada; Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs; Canadian Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for Innovation,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; International Polar Year Program of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada; ArcticNet Network of Centres of Excellence of Canada; Canada Research Chairs Program; Canadian Foundation for Innovation,,92,7,7,2,64,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

However, patterns of variation within species do not clearly fit the theoretical predictions. Exploring how genetics, environment and demographic processes shape such variation among and within populations is crucial for understanding evolution of PSM, particularly in long-lived plants such as forest trees. Here, we quantified genetic variation in PSM among and within populations, and explored drivers of local adaptation by studying the role of climate as a source of population differentiation in PSM of maritime pine. Constitutive profile and concentrations of 63 PSM and their herbivory-associated inducibility were determined in the bark of 130 clonally replicated genotypes with known familial structure from 10 populations covering the distribution range of the species. We compared neutral and quantitative population genetic differentiation of PSM (F-ST and Q(ST)). Also, we accounted for population genetic structure and kinship among individuals when exploring climate-trait relationships. We found large population differentiation and additive genetic variation in constitutive PSM. Many PSM were inducible, although very low genetic variation was observed with respect to their inducibility. Q(ST)-F-ST comparisons suggest that differentiation of most diterpenes, monoterpenes, and phenolics can be explained by neutral demographic processes. Spatially heterogeneous selection across populations leading to local adaptation was only found for total constitutive sesquiterpenes and a few individual PSM. After accounting for population genetic structure, only the constitutive concentration of two sesquiterpenes showing signs of diversifying selection was predicted by climate, with decreasing concentrations along a growth-prone climatic gradient. Synthesis. Evolutionary patterns of plant secondary metabolites depended on their chemical nature, with neutral differentiation governing most plant secondary metabolites. Evidence of local adaptation was only found for total constitutive sesquiterpenes and a few individual plant secondary metabolites. The low genetic variation in the inducibility of plant secondary metabolites suggests a conserved model of defensive induction in this species. Since population differentiation linked to past demographic history could lead to false positives of adaptive differentiation signals, accounting for the genetic relatedness among populations is required to infer the environmental determinants of intraspecific genetic variation in putatively adaptive traits such as plant defences.","[Lopez-Goldar, Xose; Sampedro, Luis; Zas, Rafael] CSIC, Mision Biol Galicia, Apdo 28, Pontevedra, Spain; [Lopez-Goldar, Xose; Villari, Caterina; Bonello, Pierluigi] Ohio State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Lopez-Goldar, Xose; Borg-Karlson, Anna Karin] Royal Inst Technol, Sch Engn Sci Chem Biotechnol & Hlth, Dept Chem, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lopez-Goldar, Xose; Grivet, Delphine] INIA CIFOR, Forest Res Ctr, Dept Forest Ecol & Genet, Madrid, Spain; [Villari, Caterina] Univ Georgia, Daniel B Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Grivet, Delphine] Univ Valladolid, Sustainable Forest Management Res Inst, INIA, Palencia, Spain","Lopez-Goldar, X (corresponding author), CSIC, Mision Biol Galicia, Apdo 28, Pontevedra, Spain.; Lopez-Goldar, X (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.; Lopez-Goldar, X (corresponding author), Royal Inst Technol, Sch Engn Sci Chem Biotechnol & Hlth, Dept Chem, Stockholm, Sweden.; Lopez-Goldar, X (corresponding author), INIA CIFOR, Forest Res Ctr, Dept Forest Ecol & Genet, Madrid, Spain.",xlgoldar@mbg.csic.es,"Lopez-Goldar, Xose/N-8053-2019; Sampedro, Luis/B-7187-2011; Zas, Rafael/I-5729-2014; Grivet, Delphine/G-9708-2012","Lopez-Goldar, Xose/0000-0003-2049-7758; Sampedro, Luis/0000-0002-3921-2575; Zas, Rafael/0000-0001-6563-2461; Grivet, Delphine/0000-0001-8168-4456; Villari, Caterina/0000-0003-3259-9866; Bonello, Pierluigi/0000-0002-7207-7651; Borg Karlson, Anna Karin/0000-0002-7833-8437","Xunta de Galicia-GAIN [IN607A2016/013]; European Union's Horizon 2020 Programme for Research & Innovation (European Institute of Innovation and Technology) [773383]; Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [AGL2012-40151-C03-01, AGL2015-68274-C03-02-R, BES-2013-062663, CGL201130182-C02-01/02]; Fundacion Pedro Barrie de la Maza","Xunta de Galicia-GAIN, Grant/Award Number: IN607A2016/013; European Union's Horizon 2020 Programme for Research & Innovation (European Institute of Innovation and Technology), Grant/Award Number: 773383; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Grant/Award Number: AGL2012-40151-C03-01, AGL2015-68274-C03-02-R, BES-2013-062663 and CGL201130182-C02-01/02; Fundacion Pedro Barrie de la Maza",,81,17,17,3,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

As part of the Gulf of Alaska Integrated Ecosystem Research Program, an acoustic-trawl survey was conducted in the summer and fail of 2011 and 2013 to quantify variability in species composition, density, and distributions of forage fish over the continental shelf and slope in the central and eastern regions of the GOA. The forage fish community in 2011 was characterized by the absence of age-0 pollock and lower densities of capelin, herring, and mesopelagics compared to observations in 2013. Age-0 pollock were abundant across both regions in summer 2013, but were rarely observed in fall. In contrast, summer observations of herring were rare, while aggregations of herring were observed over the eastern GOA shelf in fall of both years. Seasonal changes in community composition are attributed to the transport of age-0 pollock from offshore waters in summer to nearshore waters in fall, and to immigration of herring to the eastern GOA shelf in fall. Forage fish spatial patterns varied within and between regions due to intra- and interspecific differences in horizontal and vertical distributions that were correlated with bottom depth. Observed spatial and temporal variability in community composition and distributions of forage fish species may potentially impact predator foraging in the GOA, as well as the effectiveness of monitoring to detect changes in forage fish biomass.","[McGowan, David W.; Horne, John K.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Parker-Stetter, Sandra L.] NOAA, Fishery Resource Anal & Monitoring Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA","McGowan, DW (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",mcgowand@uw.edu,,"McGowan, David/0000-0003-3974-5117",North Pacific Research Board (NPRB) GOA Project [G82],"We thank Captain Ray Haddon and the crew of the F/V Northwest Explorer, the officers and crew of the NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson, and members of the scientific parties on GOAIERP cruises in 2011 and 2013.

Consequently, this venom is not used in the mixture of snake venoms used to immunise horses for the manufacture of regional SAIMR (South African Institute for Medical Research) polyvalent anti venom. Aspidelaps species are even excluded from the manufacturer's list of venomous snakes that can be treated by this highly effective product. This leaves clinicians, albeit rarely, in a therapeutic vacuum when treating envenoming by these snakes. This is a significantly understudied small group of nocturnal snakes and little is known about their venom compositions and toxicities. Using a murine preclinical model, this study determined that the paralysing toxicity of venoms from Aspidelaps scutatus intermedius, A. lubricus cowlesi and A. l. lubricus approached that of venoms from highly neurotoxic African cobras and mambas. This finding was consistent with the cross-genus dominance of venom three-finger toxins, including numerous isoforms which showed extensive interspecific variation. Our comprehensive analysis of venom proteomes showed that the three Aspidelaps species possess highly similar venom proteomic compositions. We also revealed that the SAIMR polyvalent antivenom cross-reacted extensively in vitro with venom proteins of the three Aspidelaps. Importantly, this cross-genus venom-IgG binding translated to preclinical (in a murine model) neutralisation of A. s. intermedius venom-induced lethality by the SAIMR polyvalent antivenom, at doses comparable with those that neutralise venom from the cape cobra (Naja nivea), which the antivenom is directed against. Our results suggest a wider than anticipated clinical utility of the SAIMR polyvalent antivenom, and here we seek to inform southern African clinicians that this readily available antivenom is likely to prove effective for victims of Aspidelaps envenoming. Biological significance: Coral and shield-nosed snakes (genus Aspidelaps) comprise two species and several subspecies of potentially medically important venomous snakes distributed in Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and South Africa. Documented human fatalities, although rare, have occurred from both A. lubricus and A. scutatus. However, their venom proteomes and the pathological effects of envenomings by this understudied group of nocturnal snakes remain uncharacterised. Furthermore, no commercial antivenom is made using venom from species of the genus Aspidelaps. To fill this gap, we have conducted a transcriptomics-guided comparative proteomics analysis of the venoms of the intermediate shield-nose snake (A. s. intermedius), southern coral snake (A. l. lubricus), and Cowle's shield snake (A. l. cowlesi); investigated the mechanism of action underpinning lethality by A. s. intermedius in the murine model; and assessed the in vitro immunoreactivity of the SAIMR polyvalent antivenom towards the venom toxins of A. l. lubricus and A. l. cowlesi, and the in vivo capability of this antivenom at neutralising the lethal effect of A. s. intermedius venom. Our data revealed a high degree of conservation of the global composition of the three Aspidelaps venom proteomes, all characterised by the overwhelming predominance of neurotoxic 3FTxs, which induced classical signs of systemic neurotoxicity in mice. The SAIMR polyvalent antivenom extensively binds to Aspidelaps venom toxins and neutralised, with a potency of 0.235 mg venom/mL antivenom, the lethal effect of A. s. intermedius venom. Our data suggest that the SAIMR antivenom could be a useful therapeutic tool for treating human envenomings by Aspidelaps species.","[Whiteley, Gareth; Casewell, Nicholas R.; Logan, Rhiannon A.

For instance, there is little information on the foraging ecology and breeding biology of co-occurring migrants and residents within the intratropical migratory system. Thus, we used two congeneric flycatchers - the resident Plain-crested Elaenia Elaenia cristata (Aves: Tyrannidae), and the migrant Lesser Elaenia E. chiriquensis (Tyrannidae) - to check whether either of them showed foraging niche plasticity mediating their coexistence and the effects of such syntopy on their breeding behavior and fitness. To do so, we used an ensemble of methods that included the evaluation of food resource phenology, foraging behavior observations, stable isotope ratio analysis in birds' tissues, and nest monitoring. Our results confirmed that residents have foraging behavior plasticity but reveals its trophic behavior and breeding success is independent of the coexistence with migrants. Since such results depart from the predictions based on the current (and often Northern-biased) theories of bird migration, we discuss alternative hypotheses explaining our findings, including the influence of physiology on diet and the behavioral responses of nest predators. Once there is a clear knowledge gap about the interspecific interactions between residents and intratropical migrants, our study represents a simple, yet important, step towards understanding the mechanisms underlying this system.","[Guaraldo, Andre C.] Univ Fed Parana, Behav Ecol & Ornithol Lab, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao, BR-81530900 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Kelly, Jeffrey F.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Oklahoma Biol Survey, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Marini, Miguel A.] Univ Brasilia, Dept Zool, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Guaraldo, Andre C.] Univ Fed Parana, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil","Guaraldo, AC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Behav Ecol & Ornithol Lab, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao, BR-81530900 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.; Guaraldo, AC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",guaraldoac@gmail.com,"Marini, Miguel A/J-6251-2012; Guaraldo, Andre/J-3797-2013","Marini, Miguel A/0000-0002-7300-7321; Guaraldo, Andre/0000-0003-1705-2926","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [1374-01-2, 140046/2012-7, 1459754]; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [302573/2010-0, 481772/2009-0]","We thank R.H.

Typically, this rationale is implicit in sourcing one critical thermal maximum (CTmax) population estimate per species to model spatiotemporal cross-taxa variation in heat tolerance. Theory suggests that such an approach could result in biased or imprecise estimates and forecasts of impact from climate warming, but limited empirical evidence in support of those expectations exists. We experimentally quantify the magnitude of intraspecific variation in CTmax among lizard populations, and the extent to which incorporating such variability can alter estimates of climate impact through a biophysical model. To do so, we measured CTmax from 59 populations of 15 Iberian lizard species (304 individuals). The overall median CTmax across all individuals from all species was 42.8 degrees C and ranged from 40.5 to 48.3 degrees C, with species medians decreasing through xeric, climate-generalist and mesic taxa. We found strong statistical support for intraspecific differentiation in CTmax by up to a median of 3 degrees C among populations. We show that annual restricted activity (operative temperature > CTmax) over the Iberian distribution of our study species differs by a median of >80 hr per 25-km(2) grid cell based on different population-level CTmax estimates. This discrepancy leads to predictions of spatial variation in annual restricted activity to change by more than 20 days for six of the study species. Considering that during restriction periods, reptiles should be unable to feed and reproduce, current projections of climate-change impacts on the fitness of ectotherm fauna could be under- or over-estimated depending on which population is chosen to represent the physiological spectra of the species in question. Mapping heat tolerance over the full geographical ranges of single species is thus critical to address cross-taxa patterns and drivers of heat tolerance in a biologically comprehensive way.","[Herrando-Perez, Salvador] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Ctr Ancient DNA, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Herrando-Perez, Salvador; Ferri-Yanez, Francisco; Monasterio, Camila; Vieites, David R.; Araujo, Miguel B.] CSIC, Spanish Natl Res Council, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biogeog & Global Change, Madrid, Spain; [Beukema, Wouter] Univ Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Dept Pathol Bacteriol & Poultry Dis, Merelbeke, Belgium; [Gomes, Veronica] Univ Porto, Res Network Biodivers & Evolutionary Biol InBIO, Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources CIBIO, Vairao, Portugal; [Belliure, Josabel] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Life Sci, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Chown, Steven L.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Araujo, Miguel B.] Univ Evora, InBio Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, Evora, Portugal; [Araujo, Miguel B.] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Copenhagen, Denmark","Herrando-Perez, S (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Ctr Ancient DNA, Adelaide, SA, Australia.; Herrando-Perez, S (corresponding author), CSIC, Spanish Natl Res Council, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biogeog & Global Change, Madrid, Spain.",salvador.herrando-perez@adelaide.edu.au,"Beukema, Wouter/D-6365-2014; Araujo, Miguel Bastos/AAE-7694-2019; Vieites, David/B-4481-2009; Gomes, Veronica/I-3662-2014","Beukema, Wouter/0000-0002-5839-7683; Araujo, Miguel Bastos/0000-0002-5107-7265; Vieites, David/0000-0001-5551-7419; Herrando-Perez, Salvador/0000-0001-6052-6854; Gomes, Veronica/0000-0002-3179-2691",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2011-26852]; European UnionEuropean Commission [IC&DT 1/SAESCTN/ALENT-07-0224-FEDER-001755]; British Ecological Society [4496-5470]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP170101046],"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Grant Number: CGL2011-26852; European Union, Grant Number: IC&DT 1/SAESCTN/ALENT-07-0224-FEDER-001755; British Ecological Society, Grant Number: 4496-5470; Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP170101046",,83,23,23,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Accordingly, there is increasing demand for legume cultivars adapted to this utilization. This paper reviews the available findings and discuss methodological, eco-physiological and diversity-related issues that can help define cost-efficient breeding strategies for cool- and warm-season annual legumes intercropped with cereals, and perennial legumes intercropped with forage grasses. On average, selection in pure stand (PS) exhibited about 40% lower predicted yield gains than selection in target mixed stand (MS) conditions, in a survey of case studies. Specific breeding for intercropping tends to be particularly important for species undergoing severe competition because of modest competitive ability or the targeted growing conditions, for which direct selection in MS or indirect selection for traits associated with greater competitive ability prove valuable. Breeding for compatibility with a wide range of plant companions is encouraged by the larger size of general-compatibility effects relative to specific-compatibility ones. There is fairly limited evidence for the advantage of greater intraspecific diversity in legume breeding for intercropping. On the whole, however, the available findings are insufficient for designing efficient breeding strategies for the majority of legume species. We present a range of informative and cost-efficient methodological approaches that could be exploited for future studies. There is an urgent need to assess the efficiency of novel and relatively low-cost breeding strategies, among which evolutionary breeding and genomic selection emerge as the most promising.","[Annicchiarico, Paolo] Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Anim Prod & Aquaculture, Lodi, Italy; [Collins, Rosemary P.] Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Biol Environm & Rural Sci, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales; [De Ron, Antonio M.] Natl Spanish Res Council, Mision Biol Galicia, Pontevedra, Spain; [Firmat, Cyril; Litrico, Isabelle] INRA, Unite Rech Pluridisciplinaire Prairies & Plantes, Lusignan, France; [Hauggaard-Nielsen, Henrik] Roskilde Univ, Dept People & Technol, Roskilde, Denmark","Annicchiarico, P (corresponding author), Council Agr Res & Econ, Res Ctr Anim Prod & Aquaculture, Lodi, Italy.",paolo.annicchiarico@crea.gov.it,,"Hauggaard-Nielsen, Henrik/0000-0001-8929-9691",,,,259,11,11,5,30,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"125 LONDON WALL, LONDON EC2Y 5AS, ENGLAND",0065-2113,2213-6789,978-0-12-817410-4,ADV AGRON,Adv.

We sought to explain variation in abundance of Neotropical forest birds using a dataset of population densities of 596 species. We tested a priori hypotheses for the roles of species traits, environmental factors, and species interactions. Specifically, we focused on four factors: 1) body mass (trait), 2) habitat type (environmental factor), 3) net primary productivity (NPP; environmental factor) and 4) species richness of competitors (species interaction). Body size explained much variation in density, although only when analyzed at higher taxonomic levels. Habitat type was a strong predictor of density. The relationship between density and productivity was weak. Densities were related negatively to the species richness of heterospecifics. This trend was particularly strong within closely related groups. Our results show that the influence of energetic factors such as body size and productivity depends on phylogeny, and that they act through indirect relations with other variables; alternative ecological factors such as habitat structure and species interactions play a more direct and stronger role in determining abundance than previously thought.","[Kikuchi, David W.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, POB 210088, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Kattan, Gustavo H.] Pontificia Univ Javeriana Cali, Dept Ciencias Nat & Matemat, Cali, Colombia; [Navarro Velez, Kimberly C.] Univ Valle, Dept Biol, Cali, Colombia","Kikuchi, DW (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, POB 210088, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",dkikuchi@email.arizona.edu,,"Kikuchi, David/0000-0002-7379-2788", [NIH-2K12GM000708-18],DWK was supported by NIH-2K12GM000708-18.,,71,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JAN,2019,128,2,,,,,235,244,,10.1111/oik.05625,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HJ8SK,WOS:000457469800008,,Green Published,,,2021-09-21,

Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.) based agroforestry is one of them and predominantly found in terrace ecosystems. There is an enormous opportunity to improve the system through utilizing available space by growing compatible associated crops. For this, a jackfruit orchard was transformed into a multistoried agroforestry system during the period from 2012 to 2013, where jackfruit trees were kept as overstory, and associated crops, such as papaya and eggplant were grown as middle and lower story crops, respectively. In the improved system, jackfruit yield increased by 32.7% due to fertilizers and irrigation applied for the middle and lower-storied crops. Yields of papaya and eggplant were reduced by 22.8 and 17.4%, respectively, because of competition for both belowground and aboveground resources. For example, light interception by the middle and lower story crops were 55.5 and 30.8%, respectively. However, the total production per unit area (by combining the yields of jackfruit, papaya, and eggplant) in the multistoried agroforestry system was remarkably higher than the monoculture system for the same area due to intensive land use. The benefit-cost ratio and land equivalent ratio for the studied multistoried agroforestry systems were 5.47 and 2.59, respectively. These results suggest that the traditional jackfruit orchard could be transformed to multistoried agroforestry systems for its higher system productivity including higher yield, and increased income that ultimately will improve the livelihood of the farming community.","[Miah, Md.

Baseline concentrations of glucocorticoid hormones increase during moderate, predictable challenges and thus are expected to be higher when seasonal energy demands increase, such as during reproduction. By contrast, stress-induced glucocorticoids prioritize a survival mode that includes reproductive inhibition. Thus, many species down-regulate stress-induced glucocorticoid concentrations during the breeding season. Interspecific variation in glucocorticoid levels during reproduction has been successfully mapped onto reproductive investment, with species investing strongly in current reproduction (fast pace of life) showing higher baseline and lower stress-induced glucocorticoid concentrations than species that prioritize future reproduction over current attempts (slow pace of life). Here we test the glucocorticoid seasonal plasticity hypothesis, in which we propose that interspecific variation in seasonal changes in glucocorticoid concentrations from the non-breeding to the breeding season will be related to the degree of reproductive investment (and thus pace of life). We extracted population means for baseline (for 54 species) and stress-induced glucocorticoids (for 32 species) for the breeding and the non-breeding seasons from the database HormoneBase, also calculating seasonal glucocorticoid changes. We focused on birds because this group offered the largest sample size. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we first showed that species differed consistently in both average glucocorticoid concentrations and their changes between the two seasons, while controlling for sex, latitude, and hemisphere. Second, as predicted seasonal changes in baseline glucocorticoids were explained by clutch size (our proxy for reproductive investment), with species laying larger clutches showing a greater increase during the breeding season-especially in passerine species. In contrast, changes in seasonal stress-induced levels were not explained by clutch size, but sample sizes were more limited. Our findings highlight that seasonal changes in baseline glucocorticoids are associated with a species' reproductive investment, representing an overlooked physiological trait that may underlie the pace of life.","[Casagrande, Stefania; Goymann, Wolfgang; Hau, Michaela] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Eberhard Gwinner Str, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany; [Zsolt Garamszegi, Laszlo] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, C Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain; [Zsolt Garamszegi, Laszlo] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Plant Systemat Ecol & Theoret Biol, ELTE Theoret Biol & Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, MTA, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Donald, Jeremy] Trinity Univ, Coates Lib, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA; [Francis, Clinton D.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Biol Sci Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Fuxjager, Matthew J.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Husak, Jerry F.] Univ St Thomas, Dept Biol, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Johnson, Michele A.] Trinity Univ, Dept Biol, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA; [Kircher, Bonnie] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32608 USA; [Knapp, Rosemary] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Martin, Lynn B.; Schoenle, Laura A.] Univ S Florida, Dept Global Hlth, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Miller, Eliot T.; Vitousek, Maren N.] Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Schoenle, Laura A.] Hamilton Coll, Dept Biol, Clinton, NY 13323 USA; [Vitousek, Maren N.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Williams, Tony D.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Hau, Michaela] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Univ Str 10, D-78457 Constance, Germany","Casagrande, S (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Eberhard Gwinner Str, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany.",scasagrande@orn.mpg.de,"Schoenle, Laura A/M-9614-2017; Johnson, Michele/W-5619-2019; Goymann, Wolfgang/E-4854-2010; Martin, Lynn/C-2037-2009","Johnson, Michele/0000-0002-9278-5639; Goymann, Wolfgang/0000-0002-7553-5910; Husak, Jerry/0000-0002-5860-3774; Vitousek, Maren N./0000-0003-2855-0832; Martin, Lynn/0000-0002-5887-4937","Max Planck SocietyMax Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness in Spain [CGL2015-70639-P]; National Research, the Development, and Innovation Office in Hungary [K115970]","This work was supported by the Max Planck Society [to S.C., W.G., and M.H.]; funds from the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness in Spain [CGL2015-70639-P to L.Z.G.] and the National Research, the Development, and Innovation Office in Hungary [K115970 L.Z.G.].",,64,10,10,3,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1540-7063,1557-7023,,INTEGR COMP BIOL,Integr.

However, the extent to which this occurs in natural communities is unclear. Here, I examined the foraging preferences of an important guild of generalist herbivores-granivorous rodents-with respect to seeds from a suite of native and invasive Bromus (brome) species at five study sites distributed across ae 80,000 km(2) of the Great Basin Desert, USA. By examining only congeners, I accounted for a potentially large source of interspecific variation (phylogenetic relatedness). In general, granivorous rodents removed seeds from native bromes at a 23% higher rate than seeds from invasive bromes, suggesting a preference for native species. This preference was not entirely explained by seed size, and patterns of seed removal were consistent across study sites. These findings suggest that invasive bromes in the Great Basin might experience less rodent granivory than native congeners, which is consistent with a key prediction derived from the enemy release hypothesis.","[Lucero, Jacob E.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Lucero, Jacob E.] Univ Montana, Inst Ecosyst, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Lucero, JE (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.; Lucero, JE (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Inst Ecosyst, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",jacob.lucero@umontana.edu,"Lucero, Jacob E./AAE-6249-2020",,National Park Service [P14AC00728]; Ragan M.

Rates of litter decomposition are influenced by detritivore diversity, but the mechanisms behind this relationship are uncertain. As differences in detritivore body size are a major determinant of interspecific interactions, they should be key for predicting effects of detritivore diversity on decomposition. To explore this question, we manipulated detritivore diversity and body size simultaneously in a microcosm experiment using two small (Leuctra geniculata and Lepidostoma hirtum) and two large detritivore species (Sericostoma pyrenaicum and Echinogammarus berilloni) in all possible 1-, 2- and 4-species combinations, and litter discs of Alnus glutinosa. We expected that larger species would facilitate smaller species through the production of smaller litter fragments, resulting in faster decomposition and greater growth of smaller species in polycultures containing species of different body size. To examine this hypothesis, we used a set of diversity-interaction models that explored how decomposition was affected by different interspecific interactions and the role of body size, and quantified the magnitude of such effect through ratios of decomposition rates and detritivore growth between polycultures and monocultures. We found a clear positive effect of detritivore diversity on decomposition, which was mainly explained by facilitation and niche partitioning. Facilitation of small animals by larger ones was evidenced by a 12% increase in decomposition rates in polycultures compared to monocultures and the higher growth (20%) of small species, which partly fed on fine particulate organic matter produced by larger animals. When the large species were together in polycultures, decomposition was enhanced by 19%, but there were no changes in growth; niche partitioning was a plausible mechanism behind the increase in decomposition rates, as both species fed on different parts of litter discs, only one species being able to eat less palatable parts. Our study demonstrates that interspecific differences in body size should be taken into account in diversity-decomposition studies.

Using Socotran reptiles as models, we aim to relate richness of widespread and restricted-range species directly with landscape variables and to compare the impact of setting conservation targets for lineages versus species. Socotra Island is a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site, containing high levels of endemism in relation to its area, especially of reptiles, the vertebrates with the most comprehensive available genetic data. We predicted the occurrences of reptile species using distribution models and used a novel approach to interpolate maps of spatial phylogenetic patterns. Patterns of intra and interspecifc diversity and differences between spatial outputs of lineage and species richness were related to eco-geographic variables. We evaluated differences in target achievement for each conservation unit within protected areas (PAs) under the current Zoning Plan (ZP) using gap and reserve design analyses. Although intraspecific richness was strongly correlated with interspecific richness, differences in their spatial distribution reached similar to 30% in some areas. Differences were more pronounced for wide-ranging than restricted-range taxa. Gap analysis indicates that most conservation units are under-represented in sanctuaries and that intra and interspecific richness were significantly higher outside PAs. This work will guide local-scale conservation planning as the ZP is due to be re-evaluated. This is one of the few studies on islands using genetic data from an entire class of vertebrates to incorporate lineage diversity in reserve design. This study provides an alternative methodological framework for supporting the use of landscape and genetic tools in reserve design, circumventing the use of phylogenetic distances and deterministic spatial interpolation of lineage diversity that can be widely applied to other systems.","[Vasconcelos, Raquel; Tarroso, Pedro; Alves, Paulo Cello] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, InBIO Lab Associado, CIBIO, Campus Agr Vairao, Vairao, Portugal; [Vasconcelos, Raquel; Tarroso, Pedro; Carranza, Salvador] Univ Pompeu Fabra, CSIC, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Barcelona, Spain; [Razgour, Orly] Univ Southampton, Biol Sci, Life Sci Bldg, Southampton, Hants, England; [Fasola, Mauro] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Sci Terra & Ambiente, Pavia, Italy; [Alves, Paulo Cello] Univ Porto, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Porto, Portugal","Vasconcelos, R (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, InBIO Lab Associado, CIBIO, Campus Agr Vairao, Vairao, Portugal.; Vasconcelos, R (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, CSIC, Inst Evolutionary Biol, Barcelona, Spain.",raquel.vasconcelos@cibio.up.pt,"Alves, Paulo C/B-5448-2009; Vasconcelos, Raquel/H-5524-2012; Tarroso, Pedro/I-3023-2012; Razgour, Orly/B-9646-2011; Razgour, Orly/X-3478-2019; Carranza, Salvador/A-2126-2012","Alves, Paulo C/0000-0003-4797-0939; Vasconcelos, Raquel/0000-0002-4717-9429; Tarroso, Pedro/0000-0002-2694-1170; Razgour, Orly/0000-0003-3186-0313; Razgour, Orly/0000-0003-3186-0313; Carranza, Salvador/0000-0002-5378-3008","Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia - European Social Fund [SFRH/BPD/79913/2011, SFRH/BPD/93473/2013]; Human Potential Operational Program, POPH/FSE; Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government; FEDEREuropean Commission [CGL2012-36970, CGL2015-70390-P]; Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund [13055714, 1425991]; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Independent Research FellowshipUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/M018660/1]","This work was supported by Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (SFRH/BPD/79913/2011 fellowships to R.V. and SFRH/BPD/93473/2013 to P.T.), financed by The European Social Fund and the Human Potential Operational Program, POPH/FSE; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad co-funded by FEDER (CGL2012-36970, CGL2015-70390-P); The Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund (projects no 13055714, 1425991); and Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Independent Research Fellowship (NE/M018660/1 to O.R.).

In this study we investigated whether archerfish, Toxotes jaculatrix, display any behavioural changes in response to the presence of an audience while using their specialized foraging tactic of shooting, spitting precisely aimed jets of water, at prey targets. As any prey items shot down are potentially available to competitors, we hypothesized that shooting fish would be sensitive to the presence of potential competitors, especially given the suggestion that, in the wild, this species shows intraspecific kleptoparasitism and faces interspecific competition. We found that in the presence of another fish, archerfish took longer to shoot, made more orientations (aiming events) per shot, and tended to be closer to the target at the time of shooting. Additionally, archerfish showed high interindividual differences in latency to shoot, and these differences were consistent across contexts, with and without an audience. Our results show that archerfish are sensitive to, and adjust their shooting behaviour in response to, the presence of an audience and highlight the importance of social context in this fish species. We also suggest that interindividual differences may play an important role in archerfish shooting behaviour. This study highlights the importance of social effects and competition on foraging behaviour and decision making. Further work in this species could explore whether differences in competitive foraging ability are linked to sensitivity to the presence of an audience.

Ornaments may then serve females in the identification of the most fertile males. Despite intense research on the relationship between sexual characters and male ejaculate quality, published results are not consistent with the PLFH. The aim of our study was to test if sperm morphology is associated with sexual ornamentation and several health/condition-dependent traits in Great Tit males (Parus major). We evaluated the association between sperm morphology and two types of ornaments, carotenoid- and melanin-based ventral feather coloration, to evaluate predictions of the PLFH. As surrogates for condition and health/stress status, we used standardized male weight and the peripheral blood heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (H/L). Also, we used the immature erythrocyte frequency as a trait linked to the rate of haematopoiesis, and presumably metabolism and pace of life. Our results support an association of sperm traits with health-related traits: the within-male variability in total sperm length was negatively related to the H/L ratio. This either suggests that birds maintaining low sperm variability may afford to invest more into heterophil production or, in contrast to the PLFH, there could be a trade-off between individual investment in reproduction (ejaculate quality) and the avoidance of long-term physiological stress. Contrary to the predictions of the PLFH we were unable to identify any parameter of sperm morphology associated with either body condition or the expression of male sexual traits. Thus, our study contributes to evidence rejecting the hypothesis of ornamental involvement in fertility selection, while giving weak support to the sperm competition theory.","[Svobodova, Jana; Bauerova, Petra; Elias, Jiri] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Ecol, Fac Environm Sci, Kamycka 1176, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic; [Velova, Hana; Vinkler, Michal; Albrecht, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Zool, Fac Sci, Vinicna 7, CR-12844 Prague, Czech Republic; [Albrecht, Tomas] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Vvi, Kvetna 8, Brno 60365, Czech Republic","Svobodova, J (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Ecol, Fac Environm Sci, Kamycka 1176, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",svobodovajana@fzp.czu.cz,"Vinkler, Michal/G-2072-2011; Bainova, Hana/I-3888-2012; Albrecht, Tomas/A-1130-2011; Bauerova, Petra/AAH-8642-2021; Svobodova, Jana/G-9692-2012","Vinkler, Michal/0000-0003-3572-9494; Bainova, Hana/0000-0002-4578-633X; Svobodova, Jana/0000-0001-6161-4899","Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P506/15-11782S]; Internal Grant Agency of the Czech University of Life Sciences [IGA 20144268, IGA 20154241]","We thank Martin Tesicky, Jitka Vinklerova for their help with fieldwork, Veronika Gorecka for sperm analysis and an anonymous referee for their helpful comments.

We investigated this phenomenon at the elevational treeline in the Carpathian Mountains, where beech (Fagus sylvatica) masting caused an increase in abundance of forest rodents and intensified their use of alpine meadows. We tested 3 hypotheses concerning the impact of forest rodent spillover on the abundance of meadow-dwelling pine voles (Microtus subterraneus): 1) the competition hypothesis: if the spillover affects pine voles mostly through intensified competitive interactions, then pine voles should decline when forest rodents reach their peak abundance, i.e., 1 year after masting; 2) the apparent competition hypothesis: if predators switch to alternative prey when populations of forest rodents collapse, then pine voles should decline 2 years after masting; and 3) the apparent mutualism hypothesis: if the increase of forest rodents temporarily releases pine voles from predatory pressure, pine voles should increase in synchrony with forest rodents-1 year after masting. Our results, while correlative in nature, supported the apparent mutualism hypothesis: 1 year after masting, both forest rodents and pine voles strongly increased their abundance. Two years after masting, when populations of forest rodents crashed, abundance of pine voles returned to pre-masting levels rather than collapse. These findings suggest that pulsed spillover, known mostly from negative effects on organisms in recipient habitats, can also create indirect positive interactions. Furthermore, they illustrate how density-dependent spillover of animals might increase the spatial scale of masting effects beyond the habitats where seeds are released.","[Zwolak, Rafal; Bogdziewicz, Michal; Rychlik, Leszek] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Systemat Zool, Umultowska 89, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland; [Witczuk, Julia; Pagacz, Stanislaw] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Bogdziewicz, Michal] CREAF, Campus Bellaterra UAB,Edifici C, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Catalonia, Spain","Zwolak, R (corresponding author), Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Systemat Zool, Umultowska 89, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland.",rzwolak@amu.edu.pl,"Zwolak, Rafal/AAA-2174-2019; zwolak, rafal/E-6578-2011; Bogdziewicz, Michal/J-2868-2012; Pagacz, Stanislaw/E-4824-2019; Rychlik, Leszek/B-2956-2013","Zwolak, Rafal/0000-0002-7665-5033; zwolak, rafal/0000-0002-7665-5033; Bogdziewicz, Michal/0000-0002-6777-9034; Pagacz, Stanislaw/0000-0002-0650-9575; Rychlik, Leszek/0000-0002-1479-1443; Witczuk, Julia/0000-0003-0808-1768",Polish National Science Centre Harmonia [2012/04/M/NZ8/00674],"We thank the Bieszczady National Park Directorate for permission to conduct the study in Bieszczady National Park.

The 'Tahiti' lime type (Citrus latifolia) is predominant, while the 'Tanepao' type (C. aurantiifolia) is produced to a lesser extent. Both types result from natural interspecific hybridization involving a diploid gamete of C. aurantiifolia 'Mexican' lime type (itself a direct interspecific C. micrantha x C. medica hybrid). The meiotic behaviour of a doubled-diploid 'Mexican' lime, the interspecific micrantha/medica recombination and the resulting diploid gamete structures were analysed to investigate the possibility that 'Tahiti' and 'Tanepao' varieties are derived from natural interploid hybridization. Methods A population of 85 tetraploid hybrids was established between a doubled-diploid clementine and a doubled-diploid 'Mexican' lime and used to infer the genotypes of 'Mexican' lime diploid gametes. Meiotic behaviour was studied through combined segregation analysis of 35 simple sequenbce repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphismn (SNP) markers covering the nine citrus chromosomes and cytogenetic studies. It was supplemented by pollen viability assessment. Key Results Pollen viability of the doubled-diploid Mexican lime (64 %) was much higher than that of the diploid. On average, 65 % of the chromosomes paired as bivalents and 31.4 % as tetravalents. Parental heterozygosity restitution ranged from 83 to 99 %. Disomic inheritance with high preferential pairing values was deduced for three chromosomes. Intermediate inheritances, with disomic trend, were found for five chromosomes, and an intermediate inheritance was observed for one chromosome. The average effective interspecific recombination rate was low (1.2 cM Mb(-1)). Conclusion The doubled-diploid 'Mexican' lime had predominantly disomic segregation, producing interspecific diploid gamete structures with high C. medica/C. micrantha heterozygosity, compatible with the phylogenomic structures of triploid C. latifolia and C. aurantiifolia varieties. This disomic trend limits effective interspecific recombination and diversity of the diploid gamete population. Interploid reconstruction breeding using doubled-diploid lime as one parent is a promising approach for triploid lime diversification.","[Rouiss, H.; Navarro, L.; Aleza, P.] IVIA, Ctr Citricultura & Prod Vegetal, Valencia 46113, Spain; [Rouiss, H.; Ollitrault, P.] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, UMR Agap, F-97170 Petit Bourg, Guadeloupe, France; [Bakry, F.] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, UMR Agap, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Froelicher, Y.] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, UMR Agap, F-20230 San Giuliano, Corse, France","Aleza, P (corresponding author), IVIA, Ctr Citricultura & Prod Vegetal, Valencia 46113, Spain.; Ollitrault, P (corresponding author), Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, UMR Agap, F-97170 Petit Bourg, Guadeloupe, France.",aleza@ivia.es; patrick.ollitrault@cirad.fr,"Aleza, Pablo/M-3710-2014; Navarro, Luis/D-1001-2012; Aleza, Pablo/ABF-4339-2020","Aleza, Pablo/0000-0002-8936-1448; Navarro, Luis/0000-0001-5163-5960; Aleza, Pablo/0000-0003-3554-5337; Ollitrault, Patrick/0000-0002-9456-5517","Ministry of 'Economia y Competividad', 'Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Agroalimentaria' and 'Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional' (FEDER) [RTA2015-00069-00-00]; European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission; Guadeloupe Region through the 'Cavalbio' project","This work was supported by grant RTA2015-00069-00-00, from the Ministry of 'Economia y Competividad', 'Instituto Nacional de Investigacion y Tecnologia Agraria y Agroalimentaria' and 'Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional' (FEDER); the European Regional Development Fund and the Guadeloupe Region through the 'Cavalbio' project.",,98,8,8,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

Male Calopteryx splendens damselflies exhibit melanised wing spots'. Those possessing large spots are favoured by females but also have an increased likelihood of being attacked by Calopteryx virgo, a common sympatric competitor. Melanin is used to produce the wing spots, but it is also used in immune defence against parasites that commonly infect damselflies. A total of 261 C. splendens males were collected from 26 Finnish and Latvian populations, of which half were found to be sympatric with C. virgo. It was found that males which originated from populations in which eugregarine parasites were present had smaller wing spots than individuals from parasite-free populations. Contrary to previous studies, the wing spots of C. splendens males in populations sympatric with C. virgo were not found to be smaller than those in allopatric populations. Parasite presence in C. splendens was found to be strongly associated with populations sympatric with C. virgo. The results suggest that the presence of C. virgo may increase rates of parasitism in C. splendens, and show that parasitism is an important additional factor to interspecific aggression in determining variation in the sizes of the wing spots of C. splendens males. These findings highlight a lack of understanding on the determinants of the expression of secondary sexual characters and the processes of how parasitism affects hosts.","[Suhonen, Jukka; Ilvonen, Sini; Dunn, Johanna; Harma, Oskari; Ilvonen, Jaakko J.; Kaunisto, Kari M.] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Dunn, Derek W.] Northwest Univ, Coll Life Sci, Xian 710069, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Dunn, Johanna] Univ Nottingham, Sch Biosci, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough LE12 5RD, Leics, England; [Krams, Indrikis] Univ Daugavpils, Dept Biotechnol, LV-5401 Daugavpils, Latvia; [Krams, Indrikis] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia","Suhonen, J (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",juksuh@utu.fi,"Ilvonen, Jaakko J./AAG-4842-2019; Krams, Indrikis/B-5788-2017","Ilvonen, Jaakko J./0000-0002-2311-7039; Krams, Indrikis/0000-0001-7150-4108; Suhonen, Jukka/0000-0001-8546-8945","University of Turku Graduate School; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission; Emil Aaltonen Foundation; Estonian Ministry of Education and ScienceMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [PUT1223]; Finnish Cultural Foundation (Varsinais- Suomen rahasto); Suomen Biologian Seura Vanamo ry",This work was supported by the University of Turku Graduate School; the Academy of Finland; the Emil Aaltonen Foundation; the Estonian Ministry of Education and Science [grant number PUT1223]; the Finnish Cultural Foundation (Varsinais- Suomen rahasto); and the Suomen Biologian Seura Vanamo ry.,,51,3,3,1,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0394-9370,1828-7131,,ETHOL ECOL EVOL,Ethol.

The prompt disarticulation of the dermo-skeletal elements due to taphonomic processes and the lack of a well-ossified endoskeleton in a large number of groups hinder the preservation of complete specimens. Previous reconstructions of most early vertebrates known from partial remains have been wholly based on phylogenetically closely related taxa. However, body design of fishes is determined, to a large extent, by their swimming mode and feeding niche, making it possible to recognise different morphological traits that have evolved several times in non-closely related groups with similar lifestyles. Based on this well-known ecomorphological correlation, here we propose a useful comparative framework established on extant taxa for predicting some anatomical aspects in extinct aquatic vertebrates from palaeoecological data and vice versa. For this, we have assessed the relationship between the locomotory patterns and the morphological variability of the caudal region in extant sharks by means of geometric morphometrics and allometric regression analysis. Multivariate analyses reveal a strong morphological convergence in non-closely related shark species that share similar modes of life, enabling the characterization of the caudal fin morphology of different ecological subgroups. In addition, interspecific positive allometry, affecting mainly the caudal fin span, has been detected. This phenomenon seems to be stronger in sharks with more pelagic habits, supporting its role as a compensation mechanism for the loss of hydrodynamic lift associated with the increase in body size, as previously suggested for many other living and extinct aquatic vertebrates. The quantification of shape change per unit size in each ecological subgroup has allowed us to establish a basis for inferring not only qualitative aspects of the caudal fin morphology of extinct early vertebrates but also to predict absolute values of other variables such as the fin span or the hypocercal and heterocercal angles. The application of this ecomorphological approach to the specific case of Dunkleosteus terrelli has led to a new reconstruction of this emblematic placoderm. Our proposal suggests a caudal fin with a well-developed ventral lobe, narrow peduncle and wide span, in contrast to classical reconstructions founded on the phylogenetic proximity with much smaller placoderms known from complete specimens. Interestingly, this prediction gains support with the recent discovery of fin distal elements (ceratotrichia) in a well preserved D. terrelli, which suggests a possible greater morphological variability in placoderm caudal fins than previously thought.","[Ferron, Humberto G.; Martinez-Perez, Carlos; Botella, Hector] Univ Valencia, Cavanilles Inst Biodivers & Evolutionary Biol, Paterna, Spain; [Martinez-Perez, Carlos] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol, Avon, England","Ferron, HG (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Cavanilles Inst Biodivers & Evolutionary Biol, Paterna, Spain.",Humberto.Ferron@uv.es,"Perez, Carlos Martinez/ABG-3508-2020; Ferron, Humberto/ABH-9895-2020","Perez, Carlos Martinez/0000-0001-7795-5997; Ferron, Humberto/0000-0003-2254-8424","European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) 'Una manera de hacer Europa'; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2014-52662-P]; Valencian Generality [GV/2016/102]; FPU Fellowship from the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport [FPU13/02660]","This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) 'Una manera de hacer Europa', the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Research Project CGL2014-52662-P) and the Valencian Generality (Research Project GV/2016/102).

However, dental topographic dietary reconstructions have high success rates only when closely related taxa are compared. Given the dietary breadth that exists among extant apes and likely existed among fossil hominins, dental topographic values from many species and subspecies of great apes are necessary for making dietary inferences about the hominin fossil record. Here, we present the results of one metric of dental topography, Dirichlet normal energy (DNE), for seven groups of great apes (Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus, Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes troglodytes and schweinfurthii, Gorilla gorilla gorilla, Gorilla beringei graueri and beringei). Dirichlet normal energy was inadequate at differentiating folivores from frugivores, but was adequate at predicting which groups had more fibrous diets among sympatric African apes. Character displacement analyses confirmed there is substantial dental topographic and relative molar size (M-1:M-2 ratio; length, width, and area) divergence in sympatric apes when compared to their allopatric counterparts, but character displacement is only present in relative molar size when DNE is also considered. Presence of character displacement is likely due to indirect competition over similar food resources. Assuming similar ecological conditions in the Plio-Pleistocene, the derived masticatory apparatuses of the robust australopiths and early Homo may be due to indirect competition over dietary resources between the taxa, causing dietary niche partitioning. Our results imply that dental topography cannot be used to predict dietary categories in fossil hominins without consideration of ecological factors, such as dietary and geographic overlap. In addition, our results may open new avenues for understanding the community compositions of early hominins and the formation of specific ecological niches among hominin taxa. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Biologists have long been fascinated by this disparity, using it to investigate potential drivers of biodiversity(2). Latitudinal variation in many of these drivers is expected to create geographic differences in ecological(2-4) and evolutionary processes(4,5), and evidence increasingly shows that tropical ecosystems have higher rates of diversification, clade origination, and clade dispersal(5,6). However, there is currently no evidence to link gradients in ecological processes within communities at a local scale directly to the geographic gradient in biodiversity. Here, we show geographic variation in the storage effect, an ecological mechanism that reduces the potential for competitive exclusion more strongly in the tropics than it does in temperate and boreal zones, decreasing the ratio of interspecific-to-intraspecific competition by 0.25% for each degree of latitude that an ecosystem is located closer to the Equator. Additionally, we find evidence that latitudinal variation in climate underpins these differences; longer growing seasons in the tropics reduce constraints on the seasonal timing of reproduction, permitting lower recruitment synchrony between species and thereby enhancing niche partitioning through the storage effect. Our results demonstrate that the strength of the storage effect, and therefore its impact on diversity within communities, varies latitudinally in association with climate. This finding highlights the importance of biotic interactions in shaping geographic diversity patterns, and emphasizes the need to understand the mechanisms underpinning ecological processes in greater detail than has previously been appreciated.","[Usinowicz, Jacob; Ives, Anthony R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Chang-Yang, Chia-Hao; Chen, Yu-Yun; Sun, I-Fang] Natl Doug Hwa Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Studies, Hualien, Taiwan; [Clark, James S.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Fletcher, Christine] Forest Res Inst Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Garwood, Nancy C.] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Carbondale, IL USA; [Hao, Zhanqing; Wang, Yunyun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Inst CAS Key Lab Forest Ecol & Management, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Johnstone, Jill] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Lin, Yiching] Tunghai Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taichung, Taiwan; [Metz, Margaret R.] Lewis & Clark Coll, Dept Biol, Portland, OR 97219 USA; [Masaki, Takashi] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Nakashizuka, Tohru] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Nakashizuka, Tohru] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kyoto, Japan; [Valencia, Renato] Pontificia Univ Catolica Ecuador, Herbario QCA, Lab Ecol Plantas, Quito, Ecuador; [Zimmerman, Jess K.; Wright, S.

Substantial evidence exists that aggressive and reproductive interference have pervasive effects on species coexistence, range limits, and evolutionary processes, including divergent and convergent forms of character displacement. Alien species invasions and climate change-induced range shifts result in novel interspecific interactions, heightening the importance of predicting the consequences of species interactions, and behavioral interference is a fundamental but neglected part of the equation.

In our experimental study, we assessed the behavioral response of individual workers of 4 subordinate ant species during their co-occurrence with workers of a single dominant species. Contrary to most classical experiments focused on aggressive interactions, we assessed workers' speed as a crucial factor in the outcome of co-occurrence. Generally, there was a large intraspecific variation in the speed of the studied specieseach had slow and fast individuals. Workers of all studied species moved faster just after interaction, suggesting that contact between 2 hostile workers is a stressful stimulus, generating a behavioral reaction of increasing speed. Also, the number of aggressive contacts experienced by a given individual positively affected its speed. Moreover, workers which were fast when exploring territory were also fast after interspecific interactions. The duration of aggression was significantly reduced by the speed and body size of a subordinate species workerthe more quickly a worker reacted and bigger it was, the shorter was the time of cumulative aggression. To our knowledge, this is the first study of this type to be conducted on ants and we conclude that speed is an overlooked and important characteristic of species and also individuals, therefore it should be considered as a driver of patterns of co-occurrence in ant assemblages.","[Slipinski, Piotr] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Lab Social & Myrmecophilous Insects, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Zmihorski, Michal] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Zmihorski, Michal] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nat Conservat, Krakow, Poland","Slipinski, P (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Lab Social & Myrmecophilous Insects, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland.",piotrs@miiz.waw.pl,,"Slipinski, Piotr/0000-0002-7336-4134; Zmihorski, Michal/0000-0001-5137-1635; , Michal/0000-0002-2951-3462","Iuventus Plus - Ministry of Science and Higher Education [IP2011 064771]; Internal Grant for Young Scientists from the Museum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of Sciences","We are grateful for the helpful comments of 3 anonymous referees, which greatly improved the quality of this article.

Although the selective pressures and constraints affecting chemical signal diversity at the species level remain poorly understood, the possible role of diet has been largely neglected. The chemical signals of many lizards originate from the femoral glands that exude a mixture of semiochemicals, and may be used in a variety of contexts. We analyzed the lipophilic fraction of the glandular secretions of 45 species of lacertid lizard species by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The proportions of nine major chemical classes (alcohols, aldehydes, fatty acids, furanones, ketones, steroids, terpenoids, tocopherols and waxy esters), the relative contributions of these different classes ('chemical diversity'), and the total number of different lipophilic compounds ('chemical richness') varied greatly among species. We examined whether interspecific differences in these chemical variables could be coupled to interspecific variation in diet using data from the literature. In addition, we compared chemical signal composition among species that almost never, occasionally, or often eat plant material. We found little support for the hypothesis that the chemical profile of a given species' secretion depends on the type of food consumed. Diet breadth did not correlate with chemical diversity or richness. The amount of plants or ants consumed did not affect the relative contribution of any of the nine major chemical classes to the secretion. Chemical diversity did not differ among lizards with different levels of plant consumption; however, chemical richness was low in species with an exclusive arthropod diet, suggesting that incorporating plants in the diet enables lizards to increase the number of compounds allocated to secretions, likely because a (partly) herbivorous diet allows them to include compounds of plant origin that are unavailable in animal prey. Still, overall, diet appears a relatively poor predictor of interspecific differences in the broad chemical profiles of secretions of lacertid lizards.","[Baeckens, Simon; Van Damme, Raoul] Univ Antwerp, Lab Funct Morphol, Dept Biol, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Baeckens, Simon] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Garcia-Roa, Roberto] Univ Valencia, Cavanilles Inst Biodivers & Evolutionary Biol, C Catedratico Jose Beltran 2, Valencia 46980, Spain; [Garcia-Roa, Roberto; Martin, Jose] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Baeckens, S (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Lab Funct Morphol, Dept Biol, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.; Baeckens, S (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",simon.baeckens@uantwerp.be,"Baeckens, Simon/F-2645-2016; Martin, Jose/B-1073-2014","Baeckens, Simon/0000-0003-2189-9548; Martin, Jose/0000-0001-6648-3998; Van Damme, Raoul/0000-0002-4585-6940; Garcia-Roa, Roberto/0000-0002-9568-9191","Spanish's Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad projects [MICIIN-CGL2011-24150/BOS, MINECO CGL2014-53523-P]","We thank Josie Meaney for linguistic advice, and three anonymous reviewers for significantly improving drafts of this manuscript.

Communities of organisms are shaped by a complex suite of positive and negative species interactions. Ecological phenomena like biological invasions typically evoke notions of negative effects on native communities. Yet, negative effects within specific food-web components can also have positive feedbacks that manifest elsewhere within the food web. 2. We designed an experiment to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of invasive bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis: Cyprinidae) on planktonic and benthic invertebrates and the growth and survival of juvenile bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus: Centrarchidae). 3. Our experiment indicated that the presence of bighead carp indirectly facilitated bluegill growth and survival. The underlying processes driving predator-predator facilitation stemmed from a combination of indirect interactions occurring through invertebrates in planktonic and vegetated habitats. Individual bluegill consumed more cladocerans and predatory macroinvertebrates in the presence of bighead carp. The presence of bighead carp appears to have indirectly influenced interactions among cladocerans, invertebrate predators, and bluegill. 4. Understanding the cumulative direct and indirect effects of bigheaded carp on aquatic ecosystems requires the documentation of both negative and positive effects. Although one taxon benefitted from the presence of an invader, our findings demonstrate that this response occurred because bigheaded carp caused imbalances within the food web. We urge that future studies consider a priori how positive and negative interspecific interactions shape the structure of food webs.","[Collins, Scott F.; Nelson, Kirsten A.; DeBoom, Corey S.; Wahl, David H.] Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Kaskaskia Biol Stn, Sullivan, IL 61951 USA; [Nelson, Kirsten A.; Wahl, David H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL USA; [DeBoom, Corey S.; Wahl, David H.] Univ Illinois, Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol, Urbana, IL USA","Collins, SF (corresponding author), Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Kaskaskia Biol Stn, Sullivan, IL 61951 USA.",collscot@illinois.edu,,"Collins, Scott/0000-0002-9405-1495",,,,51,10,10,2,71,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

The previously proposed sparse interactions model overcomes this challenge by assuming that most species pairs do not interact. We propose an alternative model that does not assume that any of the interactions are necessarily zero, but summarizes the influences of individual species by a small number of community-level drivers. The community-level drivers are defined as linear combinations of species abundances, and they may thus represent e.g. the total abundance of all species or the relative proportions of different functional groups. We show with simulated and real data how our approach can be used to compare different hypotheses on community structure. In an empirical example using aquatic microorganisms, the community-level drivers model clearly outperformed the sparse interactions model in predicting independent validation data.","[Ovaskainen, Otso; Tikhonov, Gleb] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Ovaskainen, Otso; Grotan, Vidar; Saether, Bernt-Erik; Abrego, Nerea] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Dunson, David] Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, POB 90251, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Engen, Steinar] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Abrego, Nerea] Univ Helsinki, Dept Agr Sci, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Ovaskainen, O (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.; Ovaskainen, O (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",otso.ovaskainen@helsinki.fi,"Grotan, Vidar/A-4056-2008; Tikhonov, Gleb/L-2910-2019; Grotan, Vidar/O-9453-2019; Abrego, Nerea/AAK-6309-2021; Ovaskainen, Otso/D-9119-2012","Grotan, Vidar/0000-0003-1222-0724; Tikhonov, Gleb/0000-0003-3040-0307; Grotan, Vidar/0000-0003-1222-0724; Abrego, Nerea/0000-0001-6347-6127; Ovaskainen, Otso/0000-0001-9750-4421",Academy of Finland (CoE)Academy of Finland [284601]; Research Council of Norway (SFF-III)Research Council of Norway [223257]; LUOVA graduate school of the University of Helsinki,"The research was funded by the Academy of Finland (CoE grant no. 284601 to O.O.), the Research Council of Norway (SFF-III grant no. 223257) and the LUOVA graduate school of the University of Helsinki (PhD grant for G.T.).",,46,34,35,2,56,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Most studies that have examined the effect of season on the diel activity patterns of small mammals have been conducted in temperate climates where daily temperatures and day length are important predictors of activity. Extremely seasonal rainfall in northern Australia possibly exerts a strong influence on mammalian activity due to the influx of food resources. Using camera traps set over a 3-year period, we documented the diel activity patterns of 5 species of small mammals co-occurring on Groote Eylandt, in the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia. All species were strictly nocturnal but some responded differently to the effect of season. The northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) displayed a bimodal activity pattern that did not differ between the seasons. The northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus) displayed bimodal activity in the wet season and unimodal activity in the dry. The more sustained activity of I. macrourus in the dry season may be the result of this species utilizing more cellulose-rich food in times of lower insect abundance, whereas D. hallucatus possibly exhibits lower dietary plasticity. The northern hopping-mouse (Notomys aquilo) was consistently active throughout the night in both seasons. Conversely, the delicate mouse (Pseudomys delicatulus) showed great plasticity in its nocturnal activity which altered significantly depending on both season and habitat. The disparity in activity pattern between these 2 rodents possibly reflects differences in predation risks. The grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni) was recorded only during the dry season in coastal grassland habitat, when its activity peaked sharply after nightfall. Our study highlights the interspecific variation in small mammal activity between the wet and dry seasons in northern Australia, which may be explained by differences in diet, habitat use, and predation risk in these species.","[Diete, Rebecca L.; Lisle, Allan; Leung, Luke K. -P.] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia; [Meek, Paul D.] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Invas Plant & Anim Unit, Biosecur NSW, POB 530, Coffs Harbour, NSW 2450, Australia; [Meek, Paul D.] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Vertebrate Pest Res Unit, POB 530, Coffs Harbour, NSW 2450, Australia; [Dickman, Christopher R.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Diete, RL (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Gatton, Qld 4343, Australia.",r.diete@uq.edu.au,,"Leung, Luke/0000-0002-8829-4925",Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government; BHP Billiton,"The authors thank and acknowledge the traditional owners of Groote Eylandt for allowing access to their land for this study.

These microRNAs play key roles in gene expression, mainly by down-regulating target mRNAs. In this work, an in silico search and validation for microRNAs related to drought response in peach ('G.H. Hill'), almond ('Sefied') and an interspecific peach-almond hybrid ('GN 15') has been performed. We used qPCR to analyse the gene expression of several miRNAs described as being related to drought response in peach, including miR156, miR159, miR160, miR167, miR171, miR172, miR398, miR403, miR408, miR842 and miR2275 under mild and severe water deficit. These miRNAs were in silico selected on the basis of previous works, their conservation in plants and their drought response. qPCR analysis confirmed the implication of these miRNAs in the dehydration stress response in the three assayed genotypes. Comparison of miRNA expression patterns in the three evaluated genotypes indicated that the hybrid GN 15 showed higher expression levels of specific miRNAs which should be related to the observed drought tolerance. mRNA target transcripts of the miRNAs studied were predicted using the Rose database, which includes transcription factors that regulate plant growth and development. In addition, results showed that the promoter region contains responsive elements to hormone-mediated regulatory elements. Network analysis not only unravelled the interaction between miRNAs and their predicted gene targets but also highlighted the roles of miRNAs in response to drought stress.","[Esmaeili, Fazileh; Shiran, Behrouz; Mirakhorli, Neda] Shahrekord Univ, Dept Plant Breeding & Biotechnol, Fac Agr, Box 115, Shahrekord, Iran; [Shiran, Behrouz] Shahrekord Univ, Inst Biotechnol, Box 115, Shahrekord, Iran; [Fallahi, Hossein] Razi Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Biol, Kermanshah, Iran; [Budak, Hikmet] Montana State Univ, Dept Plant Sci & Plant Pathol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Martinez-Gomez, Pedro] CSIC, Dept Plant Breeding, CEBAS, Box 164, Murcia 30100, Spain","Shiran, B (corresponding author), Shahrekord Univ, Dept Plant Breeding & Biotechnol, Fac Agr, Box 115, Shahrekord, Iran.; Shiran, B (corresponding author), Shahrekord Univ, Inst Biotechnol, Box 115, Shahrekord, Iran.; Martinez-Gomez, P (corresponding author), CSIC, Dept Plant Breeding, CEBAS, Box 164, Murcia 30100, Spain.",shiran@agr.sku.ac.ir; pmartinez@cebas.csic.es,"Budak, Hikmet/U-8517-2019; Budak, Hikmet/S-5835-2017; Martinez-Gomez, Pedro/G-4217-2011; Fallahi, Hossein/I-7541-2019; Shiran, Behrouz/ABF-1831-2020","Budak, Hikmet/0000-0002-2556-2478; Budak, Hikmet/0000-0002-2556-2478; Martinez-Gomez, Pedro/0000-0003-1054-8814; Fallahi, Hossein/0000-0002-8754-3491; Shiran, Behrouz/0000-0001-9997-4718; esmaeili, fazileh/0000-0002-1719-1611",Shahrekord University; Centre of Excellence for the Biotechnology of Pome Fruits and Almond Diseases in the Central Region of Iran; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competiveness [AGL2013-43550-R],"The authors are grateful to Shahrekord University and the Centre of Excellence for the Biotechnology of Pome Fruits and Almond Diseases in the Central Region of Iran for providing partial financial support to the MSc students (FE).

Competitive exclusion should be particularly strong when species compete for a single limiting resource or live in unstructured habitats that offer no refuge for weaker competitors. Here, we describe the 'cheating effect', a form of intra-specific competition that can counterbalance between-species competition, thereby fostering biodiversity in unstructured habitats. Using experimental communities consisting of the strong competitor Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and its weaker counterpart Burkholderia cenocepacia (BC), we show that co-existence is impossible when the two species compete for a single limiting resource, iron. However, when introducing a PA cheating mutant, which specifically exploits the iron-scavenging siderophores produced by the PA wild type, we found that biodiversity was preserved under well-mixed conditions where PA cheats could outcompete the PA wild type. Cheating fosters biodiversity in our system because it creates strong intra-specific competition, which equalizes fitness differences between PA and BC. Our study identifies cheating - typically considered a destructive element - as a constructive force in shaping biodiversity.","[Leinweber, Anne; Kummerli, Rolf] Univ Zurich, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Inglis, R.

Studies suggest that brood parasitism does not occur at random, but that parasitic females select nests with advantages such as higher physical stability, reduced predation risk, or lower ectoparasite infestations. However, this evidence is sparse and mainly correlative. By experimentally increasing the abundance of Carnus hemapterus (a common, generalist and widespread ectoparasitic nest fly of a multitude of bird species) in half of the nests, we show that parasitic Spotless Starlings (Sturnus unicolor) avoid conspecific nests infested by ectoparasites. Since Carnus ectoparasites impinge costs on their avian nestling hosts, this avoidance response would be adaptive for parasitic Starlings. Further, we suggest a mechanism by which parasitic females may assess the level of ectoparasite infestation to select host nests accordingly: by using parasite cues such as faeces and blood remains. Additionally, these cues may be used by parasitic females for synchronization with the reproductive cycle of host females because ectoparasite cues also indicate that incubation has already commenced. Whatever the functionality, the mechanism suggested here may be employed by intra- and interspecific brood parasites, so it might represent a widespread strategy in nature.","[Tomas, Gustavo; Martin-Galvez, David; Ruiz-Rodriguez, Magdalena; Soler, Juan J.] CSIC, EEZA, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, Ctra Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Tomas, Gustavo] UTPL, Dept Ciencias Nat, Calle Paris S-N, Loja 1101608, Ecuador; [Martin-Galvez, David] European Bioinformat Inst, European Mol Biol Lab, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England","Tomas, G (corresponding author), CSIC, EEZA, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, Ctra Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain.; Tomas, G (corresponding author), UTPL, Dept Ciencias Nat, Calle Paris S-N, Loja 1101608, Ecuador.",gtomas@eeza.csic.es,"Martin-Galvez, David/H-3707-2011; Soler, J.

During the day, the activity budget was similar for all the breeding colonies. During the night, birds were primarily on the water, drifting with currents. At all sites, birds similarly performed intensive foraging in zones of area-restricted search (ARS), although the size and duration of ARS zones differed markedly. Red-footed boobies foraged over deep oceanic waters, with chlorophyll a concentrations varying between sites. Birds did not appear to target areas with higher productivity. We suggest that range differences between populations may be linked to other factors such as intra-and interspecific competition.","[Mendez, Loriane; de Grissac, Sophie; Hennicke, Janos; Lallemand, Joelle; Prudor, Aurelien; Weimerskirch, Henri] Univ La Rochelle, CNRS UMR7372, CEBC, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Mendez, Loriane; de Grissac, Sophie; Prudor, Aurelien; Weimerskirch, Henri] Univ la Reunion, UMR UR CNRS IRD ENTROPIE 9220, Fac Sci Technol, 15 Ave Rene Cassin CS 92003, F-97744 St Denis 9, La Reunion, France; [Borsa, Philippe] UMR 250 UR CNRS IRD ENTROPIE, 101 Promenade Roger Laroque, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Cruz, Sebastian] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Migrat & Immunoecol, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Hennicke, Janos] Univ Hamburg, Inst Zool, Dept Ecol & Conservat, Martin Luther King Pl 3, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany","Mendez, L (corresponding author), Univ La Rochelle, CNRS UMR7372, CEBC, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France.; Mendez, L (corresponding author), Univ la Reunion, UMR UR CNRS IRD ENTROPIE 9220, Fac Sci Technol, 15 Ave Rene Cassin CS 92003, F-97744 St Denis 9, La Reunion, France.",loriane.mendez@cebc.cnrs.fr,"Mendez, Loriane/H-9712-2019; Weimerskirch, Henri/K-7306-2019; de Grissac, Sophie/Q-6666-2017; Weimerskirch, Henri/F-5562-2013; Borsa, Philippe/AAC-7915-2019; Borsa, Philippe/D-4967-2015","Mendez, Loriane/0000-0002-5844-3547; Weimerskirch, Henri/0000-0002-0457-586X; de Grissac, Sophie/0000-0002-1589-8066; Borsa, Philippe/0000-0001-9469-8304",France's 'Iles Eparses' program; CNRS-InEE; CNRS-Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers (INSU); Institut de recherche pour le developpement (IRD); Agence des aires marines protegees (AAMP); Commission nationale de la flotte cotiere; IRD; EARLYLIFE - European Research Council Advanced Grant under the European Community's Seven Framework Program FP7 [ERC-2012-ADG_20120314]; Universitat Hamburg; Mini Wunderland Hamburg; CI Island Trust; CI Territory Week Committee; CI Tourist Association; Marie Curie Research Fellowship from the European Union [PIEF-GA-2009-236295],"This research was supported by France's 'Iles Eparses' program (2011-2013) managed by the CNRS-Institut Ecologie et Environnement (InEE) with the financial support of the CNRS-InEE, CNRS-Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers (INSU), Institut de recherche pour le developpement (IRD), Agence des aires marines protegees (AAMP) and the logistic support of Terres Australes et Antarctiques Francaises (TAAF).

But can sexual selection also influence the brain? Previous studies in vertebrates report contradictory results with no consistent pattern between variation in brain structure and the strength of sexual selection. We hypothesize that sexual selection will act in a consistent way on two vertebrate brain regions that directly regulate sexual behaviour: the medial preoptic nucleus (MPON) and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN). The MPON regulates male reproductive behaviour whereas the VMN regulates female reproductive behaviour and is also involved in male aggression. To test our hypothesis, we used high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging combined with traditional histology of brains in 14 dragon lizard species of the genus Ctenophorus that vary in the strength of precopulatory sexual selection. Males belonging to species that experience greater sexual selection had a larger MPON and a smaller VMN. Conversely, females did not show any patterns of variation in these brain regions. As the volumes of both these regions also correlated with brain volume (BV) in our models, we tested whether they show the same pattern of evolution in response to changes in BV and found that the do. Therefore, we show that the primary brain nuclei underlying reproductive behaviour in vertebrates can evolve in a mosaic fashion, differently between males and females, likely in response to sexual selection, and that these same regions are simultaneously evolving in concert in relation to overall brain size.","[Hoops, D.; Vidal-Garcia, M.; Merkling, T.; Keogh, J.

While previous models have predicted that the female-biased populations resulting from sex ratio distortion can benefit from enhanced productivity, these models neglect Fisherian selection for nuclear suppressors, an unrealistic assumption in most systems. We used individual-based computer simulation modeling to explore the intragenomic conflict between sex ratio distorters and their suppressors and explored the impacts of these dynamics on population-level competition between species characterized by MSDs and those lacking them. The conflict between distorters and suppressors was capable of producing large cyclical fluctuations in the population sex ratio and reproductive rate. Despite fitness costs associated with the distorters and suppressors, MSD populations often exhibited enhanced productivity and outcompeted non-MSD populations in single and multiple-population competition simulations. Notably, the conflict itself is beneficial to the success of populations, as sex ratio oscillations limit the competitive deficits associated with prolonged periods of male rarity. Although intragenomic conflict has been historically viewed as deleterious to populations, our results suggest that distorter-suppressor conflict can provide population-level advantages, potentially helping to explain the persistence of sex ratio distorters in a range of taxa.","[Rood, Elaine S.; Freedberg, Steven] St Olaf Coll, Dept Biol, Northfield, MN 55057 USA","Freedberg, S (corresponding author), St Olaf Coll, Dept Biol, Northfield, MN 55057 USA.",freedber@stolaf.edu,,,,,,54,3,3,1,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Notably, ecological and evolutionary studies have revealed that reciprocal interactions such as predator-prey, competition, and mutualism, are key drivers of community dynamics. However, there is an argument that many species interactions are asymmetric, where one species unilaterally affects another species (amensalism or commensalism). This raises the unanswered question of what is the role of unilateral interactions in community dynamics. Here I use a theoretical approach to demonstrate that unilateral interactions greatly enhance community stability. The results suggested that amensalism and commensalism were more stabilizing than symmetrical interactions, such as competition and mutualism, but they were less stabilizing than an asymmetric antagonistic interaction. A mix of unilateral interactions increased stability. Furthermore, in communities with all interaction types, unilateral interactions tended to increase stability. This study suggests that unilateral interactions play a major role in maintaining communities, underlining the need to further investigate their roles in ecosystem dynamics.","[Mougi, Akihiko] Shimane Univ, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Dept Biol Sci, 1060 Nishikawatsu Cho, Matsue, Shimane 6908504, Japan","Mougi, A (corresponding author), Shimane Univ, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Dept Biol Sci, 1060 Nishikawatsu Cho, Matsue, Shimane 6908504, Japan.",amougi@gmail.com,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25840164, 16K18621]","This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (#25840164, #16K18621) of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

Better understanding the predictive reliability between factors at selection and future performance may help to optimize the process and lead to greater standardization of the surgical selection process. METHODS: PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases were searched. Over 560 potentially relevant publications were identified using the search strategy and screened using the Cochrane Collaboration Data Extraction and Assessment Template. RESULTS: 57 studies met the inclusion criteria. Several selection criteria used in the traditional selection demonstrated inconsistent correlation with subsequent performance during and at the end of surgical training. The following selection criteria, however, demonstrated good predictive relationships with subsequent resident performance: USMLE examination scores, Letters of Recommendation (LOR) including the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE), academic performance during clinical clerkships, the interview process, displaying excellence in extracurricular activities, and the use of unadjusted rank lists. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review supports that the current selection process needs to be further evaluated and improved. Multicenter studies using standardized outcome measures of success are now required to improve the reliability of the selection process to select the best trainees.

We investigated the effects of mixed releases of natural enemies of B. tabaci on predation rates, parasite performance and adult parasitoid emergence under greenhouse conditions. We tested the polyphagous predatory ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and two whitefly-specific parasitoids, namely Encarsia formosa and Encarsia sophia (both, Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae). Harmonia axyridis exhibited the lowest rates of predation when released with each parasitoid than with both parasitoid species together and showed a significant preference for non-parasitized nymphs as prey. Both E. formosa and E. sophia parasitized more B. tabaci when released with the ladybird than when the wasps were released either alone or mixed with the other parasitoid. We also found that the presence of H. axyridis significantly reduced adult parasitoid emergence; the highest rate of adult emergence was obtained with parasitoids released alone. Our results indicate that different combinations of natural enemies can influence observed rates of predation, parasitism, and parasitoid emergence. Therefore, the combination of natural enemies to be used for a particular biological control program should depend on the specific objectives.","[Tan, Xiaoling; Hu, Nana; Zhang, Fan; Wang, Su; Ge, Feng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Tan, Xiaoling] Beijing Acad Agr & Forestry Sci, Inst Plant & Environm Protect, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China; [Hu, Nana] Guizhou Univ, Dept Plant Protect, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China; [Ramirez-Romero, Ricardo] Univ Guadalajara, CUCBA, Dept Agr Prod, Zapopan 45100, Jalisco, Mexico; [Desneux, Nicolas] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, French Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, Inst Sophia Agrobiotech, CNRS,UMR 1355 7254, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France","Wang, S; Ge, F (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",anthocoridae@163.com; gef@ioz.ac.cn,"Desneux, Nicolas/J-6262-2013; wang, su/AAC-6313-2019","Ramirez-Romero, Ricardo/0000-0003-1310-0484","Major State Basic Research Development Program of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2013CB127605]; Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest [201303024, 201303108]; Beijing NOVA ProgramBeijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission [Z121105002512039]; Youth Fund of Scientific Research of Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences [QNJJ201008]; project EUCLID (H2020-SFS) [633999]","This study was funded through the Major State Basic Research Development Program of China (973 Program) (No. 2013CB127605), Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest (No. 201303024 and No. 201303108), Beijing NOVA Program (No. Z121105002512039) and Youth Fund of Scientific Research of Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences (No. QNJJ201008).

Reptiles are sensitive to habitat disturbance induced by wildfires but species frequently show opposing responses. Functional causes of such variability have been scarcely explored. In the northernmost limit of the Mediterranean bioregion, lizard species of Mediterranean affinity (Psammodromus algirus and Podarcis guadarramae) increase in abundance in burnt areas whereas Atlantic species (Lacerta schreiberi and Podarcis bocagei) decrease. Timon lepidus, the largest Mediterranean lizard in the region, shows mixed responses depending on the locality and fire history. We tested whether such interspecific differences are of a functional nature, namely, if ecophysiological traits may determine lizard response to fire. Based on the variation in habitat structure between burnt and unburnt sites, we hypothesise that Mediterranean species, which increase density in open habitats promoted by frequent fire regimes, should be more thermophile and suffer lower water losses than Atlantic species. Methods. We submitted 6-10 adult males of the five species to standard experiments for assessing preferred body temperatures (T-p) and evaporative water loss rates (EWL), and examined the variation among species and along time by means of repeated-measures AN(C)OVAs. Results. Results only partially supported our initial expectations, since the medium-sized P. algirus clearly attained higher Tp and lower EWL. The two small wall lizards (P. bocagei and P. guadarramae) displayed low Tp and high EWL while the two large green lizards (T. lepidus and L. schreiberi) displayed intermediate values for both parameters. Discussion. The predicted differences according to the biogeographic affinities within each pair were not fully confirmed. We conclude that ecophysiology may help to understand functional reptile responses to fire but other biological traits are also to be considered.","[Ferreira, Catarina C.] Univ Porto, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Ferreira, Catarina C.; Santos, Xavier; Carretero, Miguel A.] Univ Porto, InBIO, CIBIO Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, Vairao, Portugal","Carretero, MA (corresponding author), Univ Porto, InBIO, CIBIO Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, Vairao, Portugal.",carretero@cibio.up.pt,"Santos, Xavier/O-4397-2019; Carretero, Miguel A/A-1472-2013","Santos, Xavier/0000-0002-4330-4261; Carretero, Miguel A/0000-0002-2335-7198","FEDER funds through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors-COMPETE; National Funds through FCT (Foundation for Science and Technology, Portugal) [UID/BIA/50027/2013, POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006821]; FCT under the Programa Operational Potential Humano-Quadro de Referencia Estrategico Nacional funds from the European Social Fund [SFRH/BPD/73176/2010]; Portuguese Ministerio da Educacao e Ciencia; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-008929 PTDC/BIA-BEC/101256/2008]","Miguel A.

These species exploit similar bioclimatic niches, but sing highly divergent learned songs, consistent with divergence by social selection. Cline analyses suggest that within-species stabilizing social selection on song-learning predispositions maintains species differences in song despite both hybridization and cultural transmission. We conclude that ecological competition between moreaui and fuelleborni contributes to the stabilization of the species border, but that ecological competition acts in conjunction with reproductive interference. The evolutionary maintenance of learned song differences in a hybrid zone recommend this study system for future studies on the mechanisms of learned song divergence and its role in speciation.","[McEntee, Jay P.; Penalba, Joshua V.; Bowie, Rauri C.

Case studies have revealed shifts towards slower life histories in organisms living at high elevations yet no synthetic analyses exist of elevational variation in life-history traits for major vertebrate clades. We examined (i) how life-history traits change with elevation in paired populations of bird species worldwide, and (ii) which biotic and abiotic factors drive elevational shifts in life history. Using three analytical methods, we found that fecundity declined at higher elevations due to smaller clutches and fewer reproductive attempts per year. By contrast, elevational differences in traits associated with parental investment or survival varied among studies. High-elevation populations had shorter and later breeding seasons, but longer developmental periods implying that temporal constraints contribute to reduced fecundity. Analyses of clutch size data, the trait for which we had the largest number of population comparisons, indicated no evidence that phylogenetic history constrained species-level plasticity in trait variation associated with elevational gradients. The magnitude of elevational shifts in life-history traits were largely unrelated to geographic (altitude, latitude), intrinsic (body mass, migratory status), or habitat covariates. Meta-population structure, methodological issues associated with estimating survival, or processes shaping range boundaries could potentially explain the nature of elevational shifts in life-history traits evident in this data set. We identify a new risk factor for montane populations in changing climates: low fecundity will result in lower reproductive potential to recover from perturbations, especially as fewer than half of the species experienced higher survival at higher elevations.","[Boyle, W.

The aim of our study was to investigate the ability of bispecific mixtures to simultaneously produce these two services of N management in relation to their interspecific interactions. Methods Three field experiments were conducted at contrasting sites from summer to autumn to evaluate 25 mixtures and 10 sole crops. We measured biomass, N acquisition, C:N ratio and soil mineral N. Ecosystem services were assessed using both experimental data and simulation model predictions. Results Overall, prediction of N mineralized from cover crop residues was significantly higher for mixtures than for non-legume sole crops. Predictions of nitrate leached after mixtures did not differ significantly from those after non-legume sole crops and remained significantly lower than those under bare soil, especially for mixtures with turnip rape which benefitted greatly from being in mixtures. Conclusions Some of the mixtures provided a choice of compromises between the two ecosystem services, which helps define solutions for adapting mixture choice according to the site's soil and climate characteristics and to fallow period management.","[Tribouillois, Helene; Justes, Eric] INRA, UMR 1248, AGIR, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France; [Cohan, Jean-Pierre] ARVALIS Inst Vegetal, Stn Expt La Jailliere, F-44370 La Chapelle St Sa, France","Tribouillois, H (corresponding author), INRA, UMR 1248, AGIR, F-31326 Castanet Tolosan, France.",helene.tribouillois@toulouse.inra.fr,,"Justes, Eric/0000-0001-7390-7058","Arvalis-Institut du Vegetal; Midi-Pyrenees RegionRegion Occitanie; UMR AGIR of INRA; French National Research Agency (MicMac-design, Programme STRA)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-09-STRA-06]","This study was supported by the Arvalis-Institut du Vegetal, the Midi-Pyrenees Region, the UMR AGIR of INRA and the French National Research Agency (project ANR-09-STRA-06; MicMac-design, Programme STRA 2009).

Consequently, biological control is being taken into consideration as a key component of ongoing area wide fruit fly management strategies. Two parasitoid species are currently considered for mass production and augmentative releases against pest species in the genus Anastrepha in the Americas: the braconid Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead), a larval-prepupal koinobiont endoparasitoid, and the diapriid Coptera haywardi (Ogloblin), a native idiobiont pupal endoparasitoid. The prediction that the combined use of D. longicaudata and C. haywardi would be more efficient at suppressing A. fraterculus populations than using them individually was tested under natural environmental conditions. Particularly, the efficacy of both parasitoid species to kill their host, the proportion of superparasitism and the effect of intrinsic competition on effectiveness of host control were determined. Females of both parasitoids were singly and sequentially released inside a field cage. Peaches artificially inoculated with A. fraterculus larvae were exposed to D. longicaudata, whereas A. fraterculus pupae inside Petri dishes were exposed to C haywardi. While used separately, effectiveness rates of D. longicaudata and C haywardi were around 75% and 56%, respectively. However, the total efficacy increased to 93% when they were used sequentially. Coptera haywardi was able to attack hosts that had escaped to D. longicaudata parasitism, contributing by around 19% of the total parasitism in A. fraterculus. Both parasitoid species would induce host mortality through superparasitism. The simultaneous use of both parasitoids in fruit-growing regions for the biological control of A. fraterculus in Argentina is recommended.

Understanding interspecific interactions, and the influences of anthropogenic disturbance and environmental change on communities, are key challenges in ecology. Despite the pressing need to understand these fundamental drivers of community structure and dynamics, only 17% of ecological studies conducted over the past three decades have been at the community level. 2. Here, we assess the trophic structure of the procellariiform community breeding at South Georgia, to identify the factors that determine foraging niches and possible temporal changes. We collected conventional diet data from 13 sympatric species between 1974 and 2002, and quantified intra-and inter-guild, and annual variation in diet between and within foraging habits. In addition, we tested the reliability of stable isotope analysis (SIA) of seabird feathers collected over a 13-year period, in relation to those of their potential prey, as a tool to assess community structure when diets are diverse and there is high spatial heterogeneity in environmental baselines. 3. Our results using conventional diet data identified a four-guild community structure, distinguishing species that mainly feed on crustaceans; large fish and squid; a mixture of crustaceans, small fish and squid; or carrion. In total, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba represented 32%, and 14 other species a further 46% of the combined diet of all 13 predators, underlining the reliance of this community on relatively few types of prey. Annual variation in trophic segregation depended on relative prey availability; however, our data did not provide evidence of changes in guild structure associated with a suggested decline in Antarctic krill abundance over the past 40 years. 4. Reflecting the differences in delta N-15 of potential prey (crustaceans vs. squid vs. fish and carrion), analysis of delta N-15 in chick feathers identified a three-guild community structure that was constant over a 13-year period, but lacked the trophic cluster representing giant petrels which was identified using conventional diet data. 5. Our study is the first in recent decades to examine dietary changes in seabird communities over time. Conventional dietary analysis provided better resolution of community structure than SIA. However, delta N-15 in chick feathers, which reflected trophic (level) specialization, was nevertheless an effective and less time-consuming means of monitoring temporal changes.","[Moreno, Rocio; Stowasser, Gabriele; Phillips, Richard A.] British Antarctic Survey, Nat Environm Res Council, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [McGill, Rona A.

When hybridization occurs within a contact zone, these factors regulate hybrid zone location and movement. While a hybrid zone's position may depend on both climate and interactions between the hybridizing species, little is known about how these factors interact to affect hybrid zone dynamics. Here, we utilize SDM (species distribution modeling) both to characterize the factors affecting the current location of a moving North American avian hybrid zone and to predict potential direct and indirect effects of climate change on future distributions. We focus on two passerine species that hybridize where their ranges meet, the Black-capped (Poecile atricapillus) and Carolina (P.carolinensis) chickadee. Our contemporary climate models predict the occurrence of climatically suitable habitat extending beyond the hybrid zone for P.atricapillus only, suggesting that interspecific interactions primarily regulate this range boundary in P.atricapillus, while climatic factors regulate P.carolinensis. Year 2050 climate models predict a drastic northward shift in suitable habitat for P.carolinensis. Because of the greater importance of interspecific interactions for regulating the southern range limit of P.atricapillus, these climate-mediated shifts in the distribution of P.carolinensis may indirectly lead to a range retraction in P.atricapillus. Together, our results highlight the ways climate change can both directly and indirectly affect species distributions and hybrid zone location. In addition, our study lends support to the longstanding hypothesis that abiotic factors regulate species' poleward range limits, while biotic factors shape equatorial range limits.","[McQuillan, Michael A.; Rice, Amber M.] Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA","McQuillan, MA (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 111 Res Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",mam612@lehigh.edu,"Rice, Amber/F-3410-2011","Rice, Amber/0000-0002-5475-8226; McQuillan, Michael/0000-0002-8909-620X",Lehigh University,This research was supported by Lehigh University.,,102,32,33,0,79,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

One proposed explanation is that negatively density-dependent offspring performance would select for females that disperse eggs among plants to minimize competition. Recent work showing larval density dependence often varies substantially among plants suggests that ovipositing females should not only respond to the density of competitors but also to traits predictive of the strength of density dependence mediated by plants. In this study, we used field and greenhouse experiments to examine oviposition behavior in an insect herbivore that experiences density-dependent larval performance and variability in the strength of that density dependence among host-plant individuals. We found females moved readily among plants in the field and had strong preferences for plants that mediate weak offspring density dependence. Females, however, did not avoid plants with high densities of competitors, despite the fact that offspring performance declines steeply with density on most plants in natural populations. This means females minimize the effects of density dependence on their offspring by choosing plants that mediate only weak larval density dependence, not by choosing plants with low densities of competitors. Our results suggest that explaining the lack of positive preference-performance correlations in many systems may not be as simple as invoking density dependence. Resource selection behavior may depend not just on the presence or absence of density-dependent offspring performance but also on variation in the strength of offspring density dependence among sites within populations.","[Wetzel, William C.; Strong, Donald R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Wetzel, WC (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",wcwetzel@cornell.edu,,"Wetzel, William/0000-0001-5390-6824","UC Davis Center for Population Biology; UC Natural Reserve Mathias Program; UC VESR; NSF DEB, the REACH IGERT at UC Davis [081430]","We thank R.

We tested the predictions of the stress gradient hypothesis in a cobble beach model system across both physical and biological stress gradients. We transplanted seven common littoral species within, adjacent to, and below Spartina alterniflora cordgrass stands in control, cage control, predator exclusion cage, shade, and shaded predator exclusion cage treatments to test the hypothesis that cordgrass expands intertidal organism habitats. On cobble beaches, cordgrass ameliorates physical and predation stresses, expanding the distribution and realized niches of species to habitats in which they cannot live without facilitation, suggesting that niche theory and species distribution models should be amended to accommodate the role of positive interactions in community assembly.","[Crotty, Sinead M.; Bertness, Mark D.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Crotty, SM (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",sinead_crotty@brown.edu,,,Robert P.

We studied reproductive performance of Xenopsylla ramesis and Parapulex chephrenis when they exploited their characteristic host (Meriones crassus and Acomys cahirinus, respectively) either alone or together with another species. We used egg production, the number of new imagoes, pre-imaginal survival and egg size as fitness-related variables and predicted that fitness will be higher in fleas feeding in mixed- than in single-species groups. In both fleas, mean number of eggs produced per female flea did not depend on experimental treatment. No effect of single- vs mixed-species infestation on the mean number of new imagoes per female and the number of emerged imagoes per egg was found for X. ramesis, whereas both these numbers were higher in mixed- than in single-species groups for P. chephrenis. X. ramesis produced eggs of similar size independently of treatment, whereas eggs produced by P. chephrenis in mixed-species groups were significantly larger than eggs produced in single-species groups. We conclude that an increase in reproductive performance as a response to co-infestation may be one of the mechanisms behind aggregative structure of flea infracommunities. However, this response may vary among flea species.","[Khokhlova, Irina S.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, French Associates Inst Agr & Biotechnol Drylands, Wyler Dept Dryland Agr, IL-8499000 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel; [Dlugosz, Elizabeth M.; Krasnov, Boris R.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Swiss Inst Dryland Environm & Energy Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-8499000 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel","Krasnov, BR (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Swiss Inst Dryland Environm & Energy Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel.",krasnov@bgu.ac.il,"Khokhlova, Irina/F-2235-2012; Krasnov, Boris R./F-2234-2012","Khokhlova, Irina/0000-0003-0169-7770; Krasnov, Boris R./0000-0002-0382-3331",Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [26/12]; Blaustein Center for Scientific Cooperation; Kreitman School of Advanced Graduate Studies; Swiss Institute for Dryland Environmental and Energy Research (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev),"This study was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (Grant no. 26/12 to BRK and ISK).

In this experiment, we tested Fourier transform mid-infrared (FT MIR)-attenuated total reflection (AIR) spectroscopy to discriminate roots of closely related crop and weed species grown in the greenhouse: maize/barnyard grass, barley/wild oat, wheat/blackgrass (Poaceae), and sugar beet/common lambsquarters (Chenopodiaceae). Fresh (moist) and dried root segments as well as ground roots were analyzed by FT MIR-ATR spectroscopy. Root absorption spectra showed species specific peak distribution and peak height. A clear separation according to species was not possible with fresh root segments. Dried root segments (including root basis, middle section, and root tip) of maize/barnyard grass and sugar beet/common lambsquarters formed completely separated species clusters. Wheat and blackgrass separated in species specific clusters when root tips were removed from cluster analysis. A clear separation of dried root segments according to species was not possible in the case of barley and wild oat. Cluster analyses of ground roots revealed a 100% separation of all tested crop and weed species combinations. Spectra grouped in Poaceae and Chenopodiaceae clusters. Within the Poaceae cluster, C-3 and C-4 species differed significantly in heterogeneity. Thus, root spectra reflected the degree of kinship. To quantify species proportion in root mixtures, a two- and a three-species model for species quantification in root mixtures of maize, barnyard grass, and wild oat was calculated. The models showed low standard errors of prediction (RMSEP) and high residual predictive deviation values in an external test set validation. Hence, FT MIR-ATR spectroscopy seems to be a promising tool for root research even between closely related plant species.","[Meinen, Catharina; Rauber, Rolf] Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Div Agron, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany","Meinen, C (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Crop Sci, Div Agron, Von Siebold Str 8, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany.",rrauber@uni-goettingen.de,,,German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG); Open Access Publication Funds of the Gottingen University,"We gratefully acknowledge technical assistance of A.

In theory, species interactions can either stimulate evolution by promoting coevolution or inhibit evolution by constraining ecological opportunity. The relative strength of these effects should vary as species richness increases, and yet there has been little evidence for evolution of component species in communities. We evolved bacterial microcosms containing between 1 and 12 species in three different environments. Growth rates and yields of isolates that evolved in communities were lower than those that evolved in monocultures, consistent with recent theory that competition constrains species to specialize on narrower sets of resources. This effect saturated or reversed at higher levels of richness, consistent with theory that directional effects of species interactions should weaken in more diverse communities. Species varied considerably, however, in their responses to both environment and richness levels. Mechanistic models and experiments are now needed to understand and predict joint evolutionary dynamics of species in diverse communities.","[Fiegna, Francesca; Scheuerl, Thomas; Moreno-Letelier, Alejandra; Bell, Thomas; Barraclough, Timothy G.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Barraclough, TG (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",t.barraclough@imperial.ac.uk,"Scheuerl, Thomas/AAC-6358-2020; Moreno-Letelier, Alejandra/AAF-8400-2020","Scheuerl, Thomas/0000-0001-5216-5630; Moreno-Letelier, Alejandra/0000-0001-7524-7639; Barraclough, Timothy/0000-0002-8084-2640; Bell, Thomas/0000-0002-2615-3932","NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/F02129/1, NE/K006215/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/K006215/1, NE/F021291/1] Funding Source: researchfish",This work was supported by NERC grants nos.

No correlation between the amounts of alpha-linolenic,acid in alga material and phytoprostane content was found. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the observed variability could be species-specific or result from interspecific interactions.

Conflicts associated with misregulation of transposable elements (TEs) in hybrids expectedly result in their activation and genome-wide changes that may be key to species boundaries. Repetitive genomes of wild wheats have diverged under differential dynamics of specific long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs), offering unparalleled opportunities to address the underpinnings of plant genome reorganization by selfish sequences. Using reciprocal F-1 hybrids between three Aegilops species, restructuring and epigenetic repatterning was assessed at random and LTR-RT sequences with amplified fragment length polymorphism and sequence-specific amplified polymorphisms as well as their methylation-sensitive counterparts, respectively. Asymmetrical reorganization of LTR-RT families predicted to cause conflicting interactions matched differential survival of F-1 hybrids. Consistent with the genome shock model, increasing divergence of merged LTR-RTs yielded higher levels of changes in corresponding genome fractions and lead to repeated reorganization of LTR-RT sequences in F-1 hybrids. Such non-random reorganization of hybrid genomes is coherent with the necessary repression of incompatible TE loci in support of hybrid viability and indicates that TE-driven genomic conflicts may represent an overlooked factor supporting reproductive isolation.","[Senerchia, Natacha; Felber, Francois; Parisod, Christian] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, Lab Evolutionary Bot, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Felber, Francois] Musee & Jardins Bot Cantonaux, CH-1007 Lausanne, Switzerland","Parisod, C (corresponding author), Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, Lab Evolutionary Bot, Rue Emile Argand 11, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",christian.parisod@unine.ch,"Felber, Francois/E-9528-2015; Parisod, Christian/A-1140-2010","Felber, Francois/0000-0002-7611-611X; Parisod, Christian/0000-0001-8798-0897","Swiss National Science Foundation through the National Centre of Competence in Research 'Plant Survival' and grants [31003A-153388, PZ00P3-131950]",This work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation through the National Centre of Competence in Research 'Plant Survival' and grants (31003A-153388 and PZ00P3-131950).,,53,27,27,0,40,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

In particular, invasive conifers (e.g., Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus spp.) escaped from forest plantations may impair seed production of anemophilous native conifers by altering the dynamics of wind-borne pollen flow among trees. In this study, we analyzed the effects of invasive conifers on the pollination and sexual reproduction of Andean cedar (Austrocedrus chilensis), a dioecious conifer native to the temperate forests of southern South America. Wind-dispersed pollen captured in pollen traps revealed that the timing of pollen release between the invasive and native conifers overlapped extensively, and the pollen cloud surrounding female cedar trees in invaded forest was heavily contaminated with pollen from the invasive conifers. Increasing abundance of invasive conifers in the proximity of female cedars decreased the local density of air-borne cedar pollen and increased contamination of the pollen cloud with pollen from the invasive conifers. This increased the chance of finding heterospecific pollen from these invaders in the micropyles of the native cedar. In turn, the presence of pollen grains from invasive conifers, particularly of P. menziesii, in the cedar's micropyles was associated with a strong increase in the percentage of seed abortion. Our results clearly support the hypothesis that invasive conifers can interfere with the pollination and sexual reproduction of native wind-pollinated conifers. Thus, plantations of introduced and highly invasive conifers should not occur in the proximity of stands of native conifers in order to guarantee their reproduction and long-term population viability.","[Martyniuk, Nicolas A.; Morales, Carolina L.; Aizen, Marcelo A.] Univ Nacl Comahue, Lab ECOTONO, CRUB, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Martyniuk, Nicolas A.; Morales, Carolina L.; Aizen, Marcelo A.] Inst Invest Biodiversidad & Medioambiente INIBIOM, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Martyniuk, NA (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, Lab ECOTONO, CRUB, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",nmartyniuk@comahue-conicet.gob.ar,"Martyniuk, Nico/H-4426-2014","Martyniuk, Nico/0000-0002-2423-7040; Aizen, Marcelo/0000-0001-9079-9749","Universidad Nacional del Comahue; APN, the Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia San Juan Bosco [560]; Centro de Investigacion y Extension Forestal Andino Patagonico; Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (PICTO Forestal) [36879]","We thank Alejandro Martyniuk for his assistance with the field experiments and companionship during sampling.

However, the impacts of intraspecific genotypic diversity in these studies are unknown, despite it forming a substantial part of the biodiversity. In a glasshouse experiment we constructed plant communities with different levels of barley (Hordeum vulgare) genotype and weed species diversity and assessed their relative biodiversity effects through additive partitioning into selection and complementarity effects. Barley genotype diversity had weak positive effects on aboveground biomass through complementarity effects, whereas weed species diversity increased biomass predominantly through selection effects. When combined, increasing genotype diversity of barley tended to dilute the selection effect of weeds. We interpret these different effects of barley genotype and weed species diversity as the consequence of small vs large trait variation associated with intraspecific barley diversity and interspecific weed diversity, respectively. The different effects of intra- vs interspecific diversity highlight the underestimated and overlooked role of genetic diversity for ecosystem functioning.","[Schoeb, Christian; Kerle, Sarah; Morcillo, Luna; Pakeman, Robin J.; Brooker, Rob W.] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Karley, Alison J.; Newton, Adrian C.] James Hutton Inst, Dundee DD2 5DA, Scotland; [Morcillo, Luna] Univ Alacant, Dept Ecol, Alacant 03080, Spain; [Morcillo, Luna] Univ Alacant, Inst Multidisciplinari Estudi Medi, Alacant 03080, Spain","Schob, C (corresponding author), James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland.",Christian.Schoeb@ieu.uzh.ch,"Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/P-7338-2015; Morcillo, Luna/AAB-2722-2020; Schob, Christian/B-6083-2008; Brooker, Rob W/F-9569-2012; Newton, Adrian C/H-4452-2011","Pakeman, Robin Jeffrey/0000-0001-6248-4133; Morcillo, Luna/0000-0002-8589-4300; Schob, Christian/0000-0003-4472-2286; Brooker, Rob W/0000-0002-7014-0071; Newton, Adrian C/0000-0003-0303-6706","Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [PA00P3_136474, PZ00P3_148261]; Leonardo da Vinci programme from the European Commission; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [AGL2008-05532-C02-01]; Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analysis Services (RESAS)","We thank Gill Banks, Linda Ford, Marie Gallon, Carol Kyle, Laura Lopez del Egido and Allan Sim for their help with the experiment, Paul Shaw and Bill Thomas for the description of the barley cultivars, David Gibson for comments on the experimental design, Yann Hautier for advice on statistical analyses, and two anonymous referees for helpful comments on a previous version of the manuscript.

We applied the model PEATBOG to explore impacts of long-term nitrogen (N) fertilization on C cycling in an ombrotrophic bog. Simulations of summer gross ecosystem production (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were evaluated against 8 years of observations and extrapolated for 80 years to identify potential effects of N fertilization and factors influencing model behaviour. The model successfully simulated moss decline and raised GEP, ER and NEE on fertilized plots. GEP was systematically overestimated in the model compared to the field data due to factors that can be related to differences in vegetation distribution (e.g. shrubs vs. graminoid vegetation) and to high tolerance of vascular plants to N deposition in the model. Model performance regarding the 8-year response of GEP and NEE to N input was improved by introducing an N content threshold shifting the response of photosynthetic capacity (GEP(max)) to N content in shrubs and graminoids from positive to negative at high N contents. Such changes also eliminated the competitive advantages of vascular species and led to resilience of mosses in the long-term. Regardless of the large changes of C fluxes over the short-term, the simulated GEP, ER and NEE after 80 years depended on whether a graminoid- or shrub-dominated system evolved. When the peatland remained shrub-Sphagnumdominated, it shifted to a C source after only 10 years of fertilization at 6.4 gNm(-2) yr(-1), whereas this was not the case when it became graminoid-dominated. The modelling results thus highlight the importance of ecosystem adaptation and reaction of plant functional types to N deposition, when predicting the future C balance of N-polluted cool temperate bogs.","[Wu, Y.; Blodau, C.] Univ Munster, Inst Landscape Ecol, Hydrol Grp, FB Geosci 14, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Blodau, C.; Moore, T.

Many examples of cannibalism have been reported in predacious phytoseiid mites. Furthermore, sib cannibalism avoidance is known in several species. However, whether females' actually prey upon their offspring under starved conditions has yet to be established. Here, female performance towards their offspring under no-prey-other-than-offspring, water-available and humidity-selectable conditions, was observed in four phytoseiid species, Amblyseius eharai, Amblyseius swirskii, Neoseiulus cucumeris and Typhlodromus bambusae. Typhlodromus bambusae females only survived for 4.14 +/- 0.42 days and there was a significant difference in survival duration between T. bambusae and the other three species (all survived more than 8 days). Neoseiulus cucumeris females survived longer than A. eharai and A. swirskii females, whereas there was no difference between A. eharai and A. swirskii females. On the other hand, the offspring (immature stages from egg to larva or protonymph) of A. eharai, A. swirskii and N. cucumeris died earlier in mother-presence than in mother-absence (egg alone) experiments, suggesting that cannibalistic interactions occur between mother and offspring. The survivorship of T. bambusae offspring in the mother-presence condition did not differ from the mother-absence condition, indicating that kin cannibalism is rare in this species. This must be related to the phenomenon that mothers tend to die before their offspring. The short longevity of T. bambusae mothers is one of the reasons why there is no significant difference in immature survival between the mother-presence and mother-absence experiments. Lastly, the reason(s) behind such variation in female phytoseiid performance towards their offspring is addressed in relation to the diet-specialization hypothesis.","[Zhang, Yanxuan; Ji, Jie; Lin, Jianzhen; Chen, Xia; Saito, Yutaka] Fujian Acad Agr Sci, Res Ctr Engn & Technol Nat Enemy Resource Crop Pe, Inst Plant Protect, Fuzhou 350013, Peoples R China","Saito, Y (corresponding author), Fujian Acad Agr Sci, Res Ctr Engn & Technol Nat Enemy Resource Crop Pe, Inst Plant Protect, Fuzhou 350013, Peoples R China.",yutsat@res.agr.hokudai.ac.jp,,,"Science and Technology Innovation Team of Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences [CXTD-2-13-13]; China Recruitment Program of Global Experts (Foreign Experts) [2012-323]; State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs Key Project for Introduction of Foreign Experts [SZ2013003]; Ministry of Science and Technology Fund for Transformation of Achievements [2009GB2C400173]; Ministry of Agriculture Special Fund for Scientific Research in the Public Interest [201103020]; 863 programNational High Technology Research and Development Program of China [2011AA10A201]; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24570014, 23405005]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24570014] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank A.

Individually differing levels of activity and stress responsiveness have been proposed as potential sources for such variation in BMR. Here, I used an open flow-through respirometry system to examine the possible correlates of the time it takes individual Laughing Doves Spilopelia senegalensis to reach lowest oxygen consumption level in a metabolic chamber ('BMR time'). Also, the association between individual response to handling stress and BMR was studied. Breath rate, measured while holding the bird in hand, was used as a measure of stress response to handling. It was found that BMR time' was not related to BMR or breath rate. However, its values were positively predicted by individuals' hematocrit. This indicates the potential importance of 'BMR time' as an indicator of activity. It was also found that breath rate was individually repeatable when two measurements were taken 12 hours apart. Breath rate was also positively related to BMR; however, the effect disappeared when mass-specific residuals of BMR were used. These results suggest that individual differences in response to standard handling stress probably do not affect BMR measurements.","Univ Fiji, Dept Sci, Lautoka, Fiji","Kilgas, P (corresponding author), Univ Fiji, Dept Sci, Lautoka, Fiji.",PriitK@unifiji.ac.fj,,,University of Pretoria post-doctoral fellowship; Fiji Higher Education Commission through the University of Fiji Competitive Research Fund,"I am thankful to Andrew McKechnie for his help with the experiments, to Ben Smit and Christian Pirk for their help in capturing the Laughing Doves, to Catherine Sole and Suko Mlambo for helping with molecular sex determination and to Oscar Mohale for his help in taking care of the birds.

However, ecological theory suggests that no two species can coexist while using the same limited resources in the same manner because competitive differences between the species will result in one species being outcompeted. Thus, some differentiation of the diets of coexisting generalist scavengers must exist in order to avoid competitive exclusion. In this study, I analyzed the feeding niches of two species of coexisting generalist scavengers (hermit crabs; Clibanarius digueti and Paguristes perrieri) to determine whether the species overlap in their: (1) preferred food items and (2) past diets. Food choice experiments conducted in the field showed that the species' preferences for the food items offered largely overlapped. However, gut content and stable isotope analyses of collected specimens revealed significant differences in the past diets of the species. These analyses suggest that C. digueti consumes more photosynthetic materials than P. perrieri. The results suggest that the species differentiate their diets despite both feeding opportunistically on carrion and detritus washed into the intertidal zone by the tides.","[Tran, Mark V.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Tran, Mark V.] Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Tran, MV (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",mvtran27@gmail.com,,,Michigan State University,"This work was supported by funds granted to M.

The ecological similarity of species can explain co-occurrence patterns, species interactions, and how species affect ecosystem processes. A useful approach to answer these questions is to group similar species in functional groups and then perform removal experiments. Here, we conducted a scientometric review of articles about plant functional diversity and plant functional group removal. We identified publication patterns and impact; environmental and geographic gaps; ecological effects being tested; which groups are removed; and what the removal methods are. We analyzed articles published between 1991 and 2012 in journals indexed for the Thomson ISI Web of Science database. Although the number of articles and citations of experimental articles increased during that period, the corresponding increase for functional diversity articles was 12 times greater. This might be because field and cafeteria experiments are harder to conduct. Most studies were performed in temperate regions, where taxonomic knowledge and scientific investment is greater. Studies on herbaceous vegetation predominate, probably because short-lived species are more easily removed and manipulated than are trees. The main reason for the removal experiments was to test hypotheses related to competition, and clipping at ground level was the most common removal method. Few studies were performed in the field and in greenhouses, which could control for differential responses of natural conditions and controlled environments.","[Morais, Joicy Martins] Univ Fed Goias, Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Cianciaruso, Marcus Vinicius] Univ Fed Goias, Dept Ecol, Goiania, Go, Brazil","Morais, JM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Goias, Goiania, Go, Brazil.",joicybio@hotmail.com,"Cianciaruso, Marcus/B-9509-2012","Cianciaruso, Marcus/0000-0001-5866-5345",Brazilian Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),"The authors thank the anonymous reviewer for the comments, which helped us improve the manuscript.

A previous meta-analysis of published experiments suggested that the effects of drought on both stomatal and non-stomatal limitations to photosynthesis may vary consistently among species from different hydroclimates. Here, we explicitly tested this hypothesis with two short-term water stress experiments on congeneric mesic and xeric species. One experiment was run in Australia using Eucalyptus species and the second was run in Spain using Quercus species as well as two more mesic species. In each experiment, plants were grown under moist conditions in a glasshouse, then deprived of water, and gas exchange was monitored. The stomatal response was analysed with a recently developed stomatal model, whose single parameter g(1) represents the slope of the relationship between stomatal conductance and photosynthesis. The non-stomatal response was partitioned into effects on mesophyll conductance (g(m)), the maximum Rubisco activity (V-cmax) and the maximum electron transport rate (J(max)). We found consistency among the drought responses of g(1), g(m), V-cmax and J(max), suggesting that drought imposes limitations on Rubisco activity and RuBP regeneration capacity concurrently with declines in stomatal and mesophyll conductance. Within each experiment, the more xeric species showed relatively high g(1) under moist conditions, low drought sensitivity of g(1), g(m), V-cmax and J(max), and more negative values of the critical pre-dawn water potential at which V-cmax declines most steeply, compared with the more mesic species. These results indicate adaptive interspecific differences in drought responses that allow xeric tree species to continue transpiration and photosynthesis for longer during periods without rain.","[Zhou, Shuangxi; Medlyn, Belinda; Prentice, I.

We characterized the intraspecific functional trait variability of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in Catalonia (NE Spain) in order to (1) compare it to the interspecific trait variability of trees in the same region, (2) explore the relationships among functional traits and the relationships between them and stand and climatic variables, and (3) study the role of functional trait variability as a determinant of radial growth. We considered five traits: wood density (WD), maximum tree height (H (max)), leaf nitrogen content (N-mass), specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf biomass-to-sapwood area ratio (B (L):A (S)). A unique dataset was obtained from the Ecological and Forest Inventory of Catalonia (IEFC), including data from 406 plots. Intraspecific trait variation was substantial for all traits, with coefficients of variation ranging between 8 % for WD and 24 % for B (L):A (S). In some cases, correlations among functional traits differed from those reported across species (e.g., H (max) and WD were positively related, whereas SLA and N-mass were uncorrelated). Overall, our model accounted for 47 % of the spatial variability in Scots pine radial growth. Our study emphasizes the hierarchy of factors that determine intraspecific variations in functional traits in Scots pine and their strong association with spatial variability in radial growth.

Intraspecific trophic variation, however, might be of key importance in understanding community organization. Here we study the variability of isotopic niche spaces of ground beetles and its consequences for the trophic structure of beetle assembly. Stable isotopes ratios (PC and o'5N) were measured in 1156 specimens of carabids belonging to 59 species inhabiting 20 island and two mainland sites of the Masuria Lakeland in northern Poland. Carabid species belonged to three different trophic guilds (named phytophages, decomposer feeders and generalist predators). However, this division is not sharp due to high intraspecific variability of i3otopic signatures, which indicates the use of very different types of resources by conspecific individuals inhabiting different sites. As a consequence, most species studied did not differ significantly in the isotopic niche space. This high niche overlap corroborates the view that resource competition is not a major factor shaping the composition of ground beetles communities. Future studies should take into account the complex trophic structure of beetle assemblages and explore the intraspecific niche variability of ground beetles.","[Zalewski, Marcin] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Dudek, Dorota; Godeau, Jean-Francois] Polish Acad Sci, Ctr Ecol Res, PL-05092 Lomianki, Poland; [Tiunov, Alexei V.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Ecol & Evolut, RU-119071 Moscow, Russia; [Okuzaki, Yutaka] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600811, Japan; [Ikeda, Hiroshi] Hirosaki Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, Hirosaki, Aomori 0368561, Japan; [Sienkiewicz, Pawel] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Entomol & Environm Protect, PL-60594 Poznan, Poland; [Ulrich, Werner] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Chair Ecol & Biogeog, PL-87100 Torun, Poland","Zalewski, M (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland.",zlewek@yahoo.com,"Ikeda, Hiroshi/B-3940-2011; Okuzaki, Yutaka/P-2239-2018; Tiunov, Alexei V./F-7771-2013","Okuzaki, Yutaka/0000-0002-9362-0078; Tiunov, Alexei V./0000-0003-2400-3559; Ulrich, Werner/0000-0002-8715-6619; Sienkiewicz, Pawel/0000-0003-4714-8873","Polish Science Committee [NN304 372839];  [NN 304 354538]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [25891002] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank Ela Zalewska, Tadeusz Plewka, PaweI Koperslci and Ichiro Tayasu for technical help, and Helena Hereman, Magdalena Magdalena Maruszlciewicz, Pawel Le niak and Pawel Zawidzki for advice on isotopic analysis.

Some of the contending mechanisms may generate tractable signatures in the amount of trait and phylogenetic dispersion among co-existing species. When a community presents a pattern with reduced trait or phylogenetic dispersion, mechanisms based on ecological filters are brought into consideration. On the other hand, limiting similarity mechanisms such as competitive exclusion are proposed when communities present patterns of trait or phylogenetic even-dispersion. The strength of these mechanisms likely varies with the spatial scale of an observed sample. I surveyed species-rich tropical litter ant communities in a spatially nested design that allowed me to explore the spatial scales, fine (0.25 m(2)), intermediate (9 m(2)), and broad (361 m(2)) at which these mechanisms act. I then assessed the relationship between observed ant communities and potential species pools ranging in size, from plot, site, and island-wide areas. Patterns of phylogenetic dispersion within ant communities suggested that ant communities were composed of species that were more closely related than expected by a random sampling of phylogenetic pools. The magnitude of phylogenetic clustering' increased with the size of the species pool but was similar among communities assembled from different spatial scales. Patterns of dispersion of one ecological trait (i.e. body size) within ant communities also showed clustering of body sizes, and most communities were composed of ant species that were smaller than expected by a random sampling of trait pools. Trait clustering increased with the size of the species pool but decreased at broad spatial scales. Together, these results suggest that ecological filters, not interspecific interactions, are structuring tropical ant communities, favoring clades with small worker sizes. The larger dependency on the size of regional pools than on the spatial scale suggests that environmental heterogeneity is greater among than within the study sites.","[Donoso, David A.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Grad Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Donoso, David A.] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Dept Ciencias Nat, Loja 1101608, Ecuador","Donoso, DA (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Grad Program Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",david.donosov@gmail.com,"Donoso, David A/A-2059-2016","Donoso, David A/0000-0002-3408-1457",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0842038],"Funding was provided by a grant from the NSF (DEB 0842038) to A.

Pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) have been shown to derive fitness benefits (larger clutches) when nesting in proximity to great tits (Parus major), presumably because they this way discover and obtain information about nesting sites. Tits suffer from the resulting association (smaller clutches). An arms race between the tits (information host) and the flycatchers (information parasite) could thus result. Great tits often cover eggs with nesting material before, but not during incubation. We hypothesized that one function of egg-covering could be a counter-adaptation to reduce information parasitism by pied flycatchers. We predicted that tits should bring more new hair to cover their exposed eggs when a pied flycatcher is present near to tit nest than when a neutral (non-competing) species is present. We conducted decoy and playback experiment in Oulu and Turku, Finland. First, we removed and collected all the hair covering the tit eggs. Then, we measured how the perceived presence of flycatcher or waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus) affects tits' egg-covering by collecting and weighing the hair brought on the eggs and photographing the nest 24 h after the playback. Results: Tits brought more hair into the nest and covered the eggs more carefully after flycatcher treatment, compared to waxwing treatment. We also found that the tits in Oulu (over 600 km to north from Turku) had more hair on the top of their eggs in general. Conclusions: Together, these results suggest that the counter-adaptation function of egg-covering against information parasites may be an extension of original function to protect eggs from low temperatures.","[Loukola, Olli J.; Forsman, Jukka T.] Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Laaksonen, Toni] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Loukola, OJ (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, POB 3000, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland.",olli.loukola@oulu.fi,"Laaksonen, Toni/B-4241-2014","Laaksonen, Toni/0000-0001-9035-7131; Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas/0000-0002-3782-317X; Seppanen, Janne-Tuomas/0000-0002-5132-6268","Biological Interactions Graduation School; Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [256067, 252818, 122665, 125720]","We thank Sami Kivel for valuable discussions and two anonymous referees in Peers in Peerage of Science for their thorough peer review and many valuable improving suggestions to our manuscript.

Environmental variation is hypothesized to cause species-specific patterns of variation in germination, which then generates the storage effect coexistence mechanism. However, it has never been shown how sufficient species differences in germination patterns for multispecies coexistence can arise from a shared fluctuating environment. Here we show that nonlinear germination responses to a single fluctuating physical environmental factor can lead to sufficient differences between species in germination pattern for the storage effect to yield coexistence of multiple species. We derive these nonlinear germination responses from experimental data on the effects of varying soil moisture duration. Although these nonlinearities lead to strong species asymmetries in germination patterns, the relative nonlinearity coexistence mechanism is minor compared with the storage effect. However, these asymmetries mean that the storage effect can be negative for some species, which then only persist in the face of interspecific competition through average fitness advantages. This work shows how a low dimensional physical environment can nevertheless stabilize multispecies coexistence when the species have different nonlinear responses to common conditions, as supported by our experimental data.

Cases where the phenomenon is massive and systematic, such as for hares (genus Lepus) in Iberia, would be best explained by recurrent hybridisation but this is difficult to prove because the donor populations are generally extinct. In the Pyrenean foothills, Lepus europaeus presumably replaced Lepus granatensis recently and the present species border is parallel to the direction of invasion, so that populations of L. granatensis in the contact zone represent proxies of existing variation before the invasion. Among three pairs of populations sampled across this border, we find less differentiation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) across than along it, as predicted under recurrent hybridisation at the invasion front. Using autosomal microsatellite loci and X- and Y-linked diagnostic loci, we show that admixture across the border is quasi-absent, making it unlikely that lack of interspecific mtDNA differentiation results from ongoing gene flow. Furthermore, we find that the local species ranges are climatically contrasted, making it also unlikely that ongoing ecology-driven movement of the contact account for mtDNA introgression. The lack of mtDNA differentiation across the boundary is mostly due to sharing of mtDNA from a boreal species currently extinct in Iberia (Lepus timidus) whose mitochondria have thus remained in place since the last deglaciation despite successive invasions by two other species. Home-loving mitochondria thus witness past species distribution rather than ongoing exchanges across stabilised contact zones.","[Melo-Ferreira, J.; Farelo, L.; Freitas, H.; Alves, P.

Population genetic studies begun immediately after the species was detected in North America revealed genetically distinct introductions that subsequently merged, likely contributing to the successful expansion. Interactions, particularly in the larval stage, with other known disease vectors give this invasive subspecies the potential to influence local disease dynamics. Its successful invasion likely does not involve superior direct competitive abilities, but it is associated with the use of diverse larval habitats and a cold tolerance that allows an expanded seasonal activity range in temperate climates. We predict a continued but slower expansion of Ae. j. japonicus in North America and a continued rapid expansion into other areas as this mosquito will eventually be considered a permanent resident of much of North America, Europe, Asia, and parts of Hawaii.","[Kaufman, Michael G.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Fonseca, Dina M.] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Vector Biol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Kaufman, MG (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",kaufma15@msu.edu; dinafons@rci.rutgers.edu,"Fonseca, Dina Madeira/B-9951-2011","Fonseca, Dina Madeira/0000-0003-4726-7100","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI021884, R56AI021884, R37AI021884] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R56 AI021884, AI21884, R01 AI021884, R37 AI021884] Funding Source: Medline",,,115,116,119,2,61,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",0066-4170,,978-0-8243-0159-0,ANNU REV ENTOMOL,Annu.

We examined food resource use and diet overlap among small-bodied fishes in the Grand Canyon section of the Colorado River as a first step in evaluating potential resource competition. We compared the diets of the predominant small-bodied fishes (native Speckled Dace Rhinichthys osculus, juvenile Flannelmouth Sucker Catostomus latipinnis, and juvenile Bluehead Sucker C. discobolus, and nonnative Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas) across seasons at four sites downstream of Glen Canyon Dam using nonmetric multidimensional scaling and Schoener's similarity index. The diets of these fishes included diatoms, amorphous detritus, aquatic invertebrates (especially simuliid and chironomid larvae), terrestrial invertebrates, and terrestrial vegetation. Diets varied with season and were affected by high turbidity. Fish consumed more amorphous detritus and terrestrial vegetation during the summer monsoon season (July-September), when turbidity was higher. The diets of all species overlapped, but there was large variation in the degree of overlap. The diets of juvenile suckers and Fathead Minnows were most similar, while Speckled Dace had relatively distinct diets. The differences took the form of higher proportions of diatoms and amorphous detritus in the diets of Bluehead Suckers and Fathead Minnows and higher proportions of simuliids and chironomids in those of Speckled Dace. If food resources are or become limiting, diet overlap suggests that competition may occur among native and nonnative species, which could have implications for the population dynamics of these fishes and for the management of the Colorado River ecosystem in Grand Canyon.","[Seegert, Sarah E.

Habitat use often changes in the course of the cycle. Higher densities can either lead to spill-over into secondary habitats or to increased habitat specificity because of interspecific competition. Here we investigate whether voles in the shrub tundra of southern Yamal exhibit density dependent habitat use. Voles were trapped at the Erkuta Tundra Monitoring Site (N 68.2 degrees, E 69.2 degrees) in three characteristic habitats over five years covering all phases of the population cycle. Our analyses focused on the two most numerous species Microtus gregalis (52% of individuals caught) and M. middendorffii (36%). A small-scale spill-over effect was observed for M. gregalis, which increasingly used the open habitat adjacent to their preferred willow thickets at high abundance. At a larger scale no such effect was observed for the two Microtus species - a result which is explained by the overall moderate densities of voles and the large spatial extent of the primary habitat of M. middendorffii: moist moss dwarf shrub tundra.

However, contradictory empirical results have fuelled claims that fragmentation has been overemphasized, and more attention should be given to habitat loss for preserving species. We assess variation in species sensitivity to forest amount and fragmentation and evaluate if fragmentation is related to extinction thresholds in seven forest bird species. LocationEurope. MethodsWe use the percentage of forest cover and the proportion of cover occurring in the largest patch to partition effects of forest amount versus fragmentation, and apply logistic regression to model the presence-absence of 17 forest bird species. For seven species showing robust models, we define two fragmentation scenarios, low and maximum, across the forest cover gradient and quantify species' sensitivity to forest contraction with no fragmentation, and to fragmentation under constant forest cover. Finally, we develop two tests of the extinction threshold hypothesis by comparing the occurrence probability of each species under the two fragmentation scenarios at different forest covers. ResultsAs expected, forest contraction had negative impacts on the occurrence probability of all seven species modelled, but - in line with theory - fragmentation also led to a higher extinction threshold for three (Western capercaillie, Hazel grouse and Eurasian pygmy-owl). One species (Black woodpecker) exhibited the opposite pattern indicating that it probably benefits from fragmentation. Differences among species responses may reflect dispersal abilities, specializations in resources/habitat characteristics and/or sensitivity to potential modifications of interspecific interactions. Main conclusionsAlthough forest amount is of primary importance for the persistence of forest specialist birds, fragmentation is also relevant for some, and neglecting forest fragmentation would be a mistake for these species. Species-specific traits can be helpful for interpreting species' reactions to fragmentation, and it should not be assumed that it always, or never, matters.","[Rueda, Marta; Morales-Castilla, Ignacio; Vidanes, Rosa M.; Ferrero, Mila; Rodriguez, Miguel A.] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Life Sci, Forest Ecol & Restorat Grp, Alcala De Henares 28871, Spain; [Rueda, Marta; Hawkins, Bradford A.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Rueda, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mruedaga@uci.edu,"MORALES-CASTILLA, IGNACIO/J-6663-2016; Morales-Castilla, Ignacio/AAB-2649-2019; Rodriguez, Miguel A/A-3409-2011; Rueda, Marta/K-5024-2014","MORALES-CASTILLA, IGNACIO/0000-0002-8570-9312; Morales-Castilla, Ignacio/0000-0002-8570-9312; Rodriguez, Miguel A/0000-0002-4082-2995; Rueda, Marta/0000-0002-9754-6258",Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [CGL2010-22119]; University of Alcala; Spanish Ministry for Education and ScienceSpanish Government [BVA-2010-0596],This study was sponsored by a research grant from the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain (CGL2010-22119 to M.

Sea stars are ubiquitous predators with diverse diets that play functionally important roles in the benthos. In this study, we examined the diet and the ecological roles of three sympatric species of the genus Astropecten (A. aranciacus, A. irregularis pentacanthus and A. platyacanthus). The study was performed between March 2010 and February 2011 on the Maresme coast (northwestern Mediterranean Sea). Results showed that their main diet consisted on gastropods and bivalves, such as Glycymeris glycymeris, Callista chione, Gibbula guttadauri and Cyclope neritea. Food competition between species was avoided by partition of prey resources. Intraspecific differences in the dietary compositions between seasons were found, but not between size classes. Ontogenetic patterns of prey size consumption were recognized in the three species. A large diet overlap was detected between A. aranciacus and A. platyacanthus in winter, due to changes in prey availability. Nevertheless, the analysis of the infaunal community composition and stomach contents indicated that food selection was not associated with prey availability.","[Baeta, Marc; Ramon, Montserrat] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain; [Ramon, Montserrat] Ctr Oceanog Balears, IEO, Palma De Mallorca 07015, Spain","Ramon, M (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Spain.",mramon@icm.csic.es,"Ramon, Montserrat/I-2572-2015; baeta, Marc/M-1077-2019","Ramon, Montserrat/0000-0001-7875-9293; ",,,,69,13,13,1,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

CRUSTACEA; ENVIRONMENTAL-STRESS; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; SPECIES RICHNESS; ROCKY SHORES; MUSSEL BEDS; SETTLEMENT; COMMUNITY; LARVAE; DETERMINANTS,"Barnacles are dominant sessile invertebrates on many rocky shores worldwide. Hence, investigating the factors that affect their recruitment is important. Through field experiments done on the Atlantic coast of Canada, we investigated interspecific and intraspecific relationships affecting intertidal barnacle recruitment. Specifically, we evaluated the effects of seaweed canopies (Ascophyllum nodosum) and adult barnacles (Semibalanus balanoides) on the density of barnacle recruits at the end of the recruitment season. The effects of three canopy treatments on barnacle recruitment and understory environmental conditions allowed us to identify positive and negative effects of canopies. At mid-intertidal elevations subjected to a moderate wave action, we found that, during high tides, the flexible algal fronds damage wire sensors established on the substrate (whiplash effect) and limit barnacle recruitment. However, at low tide, algal canopies limit water loss and temperature extremes and enhance barnacle recruitment in understory habitats. The net effect of algal canopies on barnacle recruitment, however, was neutral, as the positive and negative influences balanced out. By manipulating the abundance of adult barnacles under the seaweed canopies, we found that adult barnacles enhance barnacle recruitment, likely due to the known attraction that adults exert on larvae seeking settlement and to the absence of post-settlement events that could otherwise have blurred such effects by the adults. The presence of adult barnacles, however, did not protect developing recruits from canopy whiplash effects. By understanding the contrasting influences that intertidal algal canopies have on understory abiotic conditions and barnacle recruitment, our ability to predict net canopy effects depending on the relative degree of physiological (e.g., high vs. low intertidal zone) and physical (e.g., sheltered vs. exposed shores) stresses should increase. This study also suggests that recruitment, considered as an important external factor in environmental models of community organization, can also be affected by components of the community itself, potentially triggering local feedbacks.

Behavioral consistency has been shown to affect dispersal, foraging, exploration, and antipredator responses, which may have an impact on parental and offspring survival. Despite increasing research in behavioral consistency, the repeatability of nest defense behavior has rarely been assessed in wild bird populations. Furthermore, previous studies investigating nest defense behavior have utilized laboratory studies or mounted predators to elicit defensive behavior. It is important to assess personality in wild populations to fully understand the fitness consequences of behavioral consistency across natural contexts and to utilize live predators or competitors for accurate assessment of defensive behavior. We used an ecologically relevant, live, invasive, nest site competitor, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), to elicit nest defense behavior in a wild population of Eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) to determine if nest defense behavior is repeatable within and between years for males and females (males: 2009, N = 17; 2010, N = 18; both years, N = 9. Females: 2009, N = 22; 2010, N = 15; both years, N = 11). We also determined if individual behavior changes as a function of season, parental age, brood size, or the number of house sparrows around the nest site. We found that females demonstrated repeatable behavior both within and between years. Male nest defense behavior was only repeatable in 1 year and was influenced by season in the other year. Parental age, brood size, and the number of house sparrows around the nest site did not affect nest defense behavior. We conclude that Eastern bluebirds demonstrate consistent nest defense behavior, or personality, although males are more plastic than females.","[Burtka, Jennifer L.; Grindstaff, Jennifer L.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Zool, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Burtka, JL (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Zool, 501 Life Sci West, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",jay.burtka@okstate.edu,,,Bob and Julia Bollinger; Oklahoma Ornithological Society; Payne County Audubon Society; Department of Zoology at Oklahoma State University,"We would like to thank our field technicians and volunteers for help with this project, in particular Emily Clark, Erin LaVasque, and Brian Hidden.

This variation is often correlated between localities depending on the geographical separation between them, and different species can respond to local environmental fluctuations similarly or differently, depending on their adaptation. How this emerging structure in environmental correlation (between-patches and between-species) affects spatial community dynamics is an open question. This paper aims at a general understanding of the interactions between the environmental correlation structure and population dynamics in spatial networks of local communities (metacommunities), by studying simple two-patch, two-species systems. Three different pairs of interspecific interactions are considered: competition, consumer-resource interaction, and host-parasitoid interaction. While the results paint a relatively complex picture of the effect of environmental correlation, the interaction between environmental forcing, dispersal, and local interactions can be understood via two mechanisms. While increasing between-patch environmental correlation couples immigration and local densities (destabilising effect), the coupling between local populations under increased between-species environmental correlation can either amplify or dampen population fluctuations, depending on the patterns in density dependence. This work provides a unifying framework for modelling stochastic metacommunities, and forms a foundation for a better understanding of population responses to environmental fluctuations in natural systems.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Helsinki, Finland","Ruokolainen, L (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Helsinki, Finland.",lasse.ruokolainen@helsinki.fi,,"Ruokolainen, Lasse/0000-0003-0951-9100",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission,"The work was funded by the Academy of Finland.

Few studies have examined inter-specific competition in conjunction with intra-specific competition, with an individual-based approach. To our knowledge, none has been conducted on marine top predators. Sympatric Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) share similar geographic habitats and potentially compete. We studied their foraging niche overlap at Cabo Douglas, Fernandina Island from simultaneously collected dive and movement data to examine spatial and temporal inter-and intra-specific competition. Sea lions exhibited 3 foraging strategies (shallow, intermediate and deep) indicating intra-specific competition. Fur seals exhibited one foraging strategy, diving predominantly at night, between 0-80 m depth and mostly at 19-22 h. Most sea lion dives also occurred at night (63%), between 0-40 m, within fur seals' diving depth range. 34% of sea lions night dives occurred at 19-22 h, when fur seals dived the most, but most of them occurred at dawn and dusk, when fur seals exhibited the least amount of dives. Fur seals and sea lions foraging behavior overlapped at 19 and 21 h between 0-30 m depths. Sea lions from the deep diving strategy exhibited the greatest foraging overlap with fur seals, in time (19 h), depth during overlapping time (21-24 m), and foraging range (37.7%). Fur seals foraging range was larger. Cabo Douglas northwest coastal area, region of highest diving density, is a foraging hot spot for both species. Fur seals and sea lions foraging niche overlap occurred, but segregation also occurred; fur seals primarily dived at night, while sea lions exhibited night and day diving. Both species exploited depths and areas exclusive to their species. Niche breadth generally increases with environmental uncertainty and decreased productivity. Potential competition between these species could be greater during warmer periods when prey availability is reduced.","[Villegas-Amtmann, Stella; Jeglinski, Jana W.

We used these distributions to test the hypothesis that when projected onto past, alternative climate surfaces, species distribution models (SDMs) created using only climate variables are concordant with the empirical data of fossil Microtus species occurrences. Location Specimens from 11 fossil localities in California, Oregon and Nevada were identified and evaluated. Methods Geometric morphometrics and discriminant analyses were used to identify fossil Microtus specimens. Using a maximum-entropy modelling approach, the best model for all five species was selected using the Akaike information criterion. Nineteen bioclimate variables were used to create SDMs for the five Microtus species using both Community Climate System Model (CCSM) and Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) models. Results We confidently identified 144 Microtus fossils, including the first fossil specimens of Microtus oregoni and Microtus townsendii. SDMs reconstructed approximately half the extralimital fossil occurrences (i.e. those found outside the present-day range). Those species with extralimital occurrences not reconstructed have niche models primarily influenced by precipitation variables. The two species whose extralimitals were well predicted occupy indistinguishable climatic niches. Main conclusions The ranges of Pacific coast Microtus species have undergone substantial regional contractions since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21ka). Inconsistencies between LGM SDMs and Quaternary fossil ranges indicate potential problems with LGM precipitation reconstructions, although interspecific interactions are also likely to contribute to these differences. Overall, the study highlights the need for further, detailed, species-level palaeodistributions to put recent observations in a broader temporal context and examine the effectiveness of SDMs coupled with climate models for predicting range dynamics under scenarios of climate change.","[McGuire, Jenny L.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Davis, Edward Byrd] Univ Oregon, Museum Nat & Cultural Hist, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Davis, Edward Byrd] Univ Oregon, Dept Geol Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","McGuire, JL (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jennymcg@u.washington.edu,"McGuire, Jenny L./G-8819-2011","McGuire, Jenny L./0000-0002-0663-6902",EU project MOTIF [EVK2-CT-2002-00153]; BNHM NSF GK-12 ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF); Junea W.

Here, we present a first quantification of the interaction structure of a herbivore-centered food web from the High Arctic. Targeting the Lepidoptera of Northeast Greenland, we introduce generalized overlap indices as a novel tool for comparing different types of indirect interactions. First, we quantify the scope for top-down-up interactions as the probability that a herbivore attacking plant species i itself fed as a larva on species j. Second, we gauge this herbivore overlap against the potential for bottom-up-down interactions, quantified as the probability that a parasitoid attacking herbivore species i itself developed as a larva on species j. Third, we assess the impact of interactions with other food web modules, by extending the core web around the key herbivore Sympistis nigrita to other predator guilds (birds and spiders). We find the host specificity of both herbivores and parasitoids to be variable, with broad generalists occurring in both trophic layers. Indirect links through shared resources and through shared natural enemies both emerge as forces with a potential for shaping the herbivore community. The structure of the host-parasitoid submodule of the food web suggests scope for classic apparent competition. Yet, based on predation experiments, we estimate that birds kill as many (8%) larvae of S. nigrita as do parasitoids (8%), and that spiders kill many more (38%). Interactions between these predator guilds may result in further complexities. Our results caution against broad generalizations from studies of limited food web modules, and show the potential for interactions within and between guilds of extended webs. They also add a data point from the northernmost insect communities on Earth, and describe the baseline structure of a food web facing imminent climate change.","[Roslin, Tomas; Wirta, Helena; Hopkins, Tapani; Hardwick, Bess] Univ Helsinki, Dept Agr Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Varkonyi, Gergely] Friendship Pk Res Ctr, Nat Environm Ctr, Finnish Environm Inst, Kuhmo, Finland","Roslin, T (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Agr Sci, Helsinki, Finland.",tomas.roslin@helsinki.fi,"Varkonyi, Gergely/I-2310-2012; Hopkins, Tapani/U-6088-2019; Roslin, Tomas/E-8648-2016; Wirta, Helena/U-1892-2019","Varkonyi, Gergely/0000-0002-7977-2753; Roslin, Tomas/0000-0002-2957-4791; Wirta, Helena/0000-0002-4667-2166; Hardwick, Bess/0000-0001-5195-6115; Hopkins, Tapani/0000-0002-2256-0098",INTERACT under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme; University of Helsinki [788/51/2010]; Kone foundation,"Funding by INTERACT (http://www.eu-interact.org/; project QUANTIC) under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme, by the University of Helsinki (http://www.helsinki.fi/university/index.html; grant number 788/51/2010 to TR), and by the Kone foundation (http://www.koneensaatio.fi/en/, through a grant to HW) is gratefully acknowledged.

The optimal caste allocation theory argues that specialized morphological castes are efficient at specific tasks, and hence different caste ratios should affect the ergonomic efficiency, hence reproductive output of the colony. However, the reproductive output of different caste ratios has been documented in few species of insects with equivocal support for the theory. This study investigated whether the ratios of nonreproductive and reproductive morphs affect the reproductive output of a recently discovered social trematode, Philophthalmus sp., in which the nonreproductive members are hypothesized to be defensive specialists. A census of natural infections and a manipulative in vitro experiment demonstrated a positive association between the reproductive output of trematode colonies and the ratio of nonreproductive to reproductive morphs in the presence of an intra-host trematode competitor, Maritrema novaezealandensis. On the contrary, without the competitor, reproductive output was negatively associated with the proportion of nonreproductive castes in colonies. Our findings demonstrate for the first time a clear fitness benefit associated with the nonreproductive castes in the presence of a competitor while illustrating the cost of maintaining such morphs in noncompetitive situations. Although the proximate mechanisms controlling caste ratio remain unclear in this trematode system, this study supports the prediction that the fitness of colonies is influenced by the composition of specialized functional morphs in social organisms, suggesting a potential for adaptive shifts of caste ratios over evolutionary time.","[Kamiya, T.; Poulin, R.] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand","Kamiya, T (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.",philophthalmus@gmail.com,"Poulin, Robert/C-3117-2008; Kamiya, Tsukushi/AAX-6412-2020","Poulin, Robert/0000-0003-1390-1206; Kamiya, Tsukushi/0000-0002-9020-6699",,,,35,15,16,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1010-061X,1420-9101,,J EVOLUTION BIOL,J.

Most existing light availability models either consider only homogeneous canopies or are based on optical principles that are too complex for multi-annual and large-scale simulations required for evaluating weed dynamics. The TROLL model adopted a simpler approach, discretizing the canopy into cubic volume cells (voxels) and successively calculating PAR transmitted between voxel layers as a function of leaf area and extinction coefficient in each voxel. The present study aimed at developing at a simple, generic individual-based 3D model predicting light availability and interception in heterogeneous canopies for subsequent introduction into a weed dynamics model called FLORSYS. In a first step, TROLL was adapted to crop:weed canopies for arable crops in temperate latitudes by (1) developing a new function adapted to annuals for describing plant morphology, (2) accounting for lateral light transmission as a function of solar angle, and (3) predicting the variation in lateral transmission with season and latitude. In the second step, the predictions produced by the FLORSYS light availability model were compared to PAR measurements in heterogeneous crop stands. The model was shown to rank situations correctly and to predict incident PAR satisfactorily. A sensitivity analysis of FLoRSYS identified the voxel size optimizing prediction quality. In the last step, simulations were run to evaluate the potential of biological weed regulation via crop:weed competition for light. The present model will be connected to emergence, growth and development models in further studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Munier-Jolain, N. M.; Guyot, S. H.

Generalist fish species are recognised as important couplers of benthic and pelagic food-web compartments in lakes. However, interspecific niche segregation and individual specialisation may limit the potential for generalistic feeding behaviour. 2. We studied summer habitat use, stomach contents and stable isotopic compositions of the generalist feeder Arctic charr coexisting with its common resource competitor brown trout in five subarctic lakes in northern Norway to reveal population-level and individual-level niche plasticity. 3. Charr and trout showed partial niche segregation in all five lakes. Charr used all habitat types and a wide variety of invertebrate prey including zooplankton, whereas trout fed mainly on insects in the littoral zone. Hence, charr showed a higher potential to promote habitat and food-web coupling compared to littoral-dwelling trout. 4. The level of niche segregation between charr and trout and between pelagic-caught and littoral-caught charr depended on the prevailing patterns of interspecific and intraspecific resource competition. The two fish species had partially overlapping trophic niches in one lake where charr numerically dominated the fish community, whereas the most segregated niches occurred in lakes where trout were more abundant. 5. In general, pelagic-caught charr had substantially narrower dietary and isotopic niches and relied less on littoral carbon sources compared to littoral-caught conspecifics that included generalist as well as specialised benthivorous and planktivorous individuals. Despite the partially specialised planktivorous niche and thus reduced potential of pelagic-dwelling charr to promote benthicpelagic coupling, the isotopic compositions of both charr subpopulations suggested a significant reliance on both littoral and pelagic carbon sources in all five study lakes. 6. Our study demonstrates that both interspecific niche segregation between and individual trophic specialisation within generalist fish species can constrain food-web coupling and alter energy mobilisation to top consumers in subarctic lakes. Nevertheless, pelagic and littoral habitats and food-web compartments may still be highly integrated due to the potentially plastic foraging behaviour of top consumers.","[Eloranta, Antti P.] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Knudsen, Rune; Amundsen, Per-Arne] Univ Tromso, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway","Eloranta, AP (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FIN-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",antti.eloranta@jyu.fi,"Eloranta, Antti Pekka/AAA-1426-2020","Amundsen, Per-Arne/0000-0002-2203-8216; Eloranta, Antti/0000-0002-8893-0135",Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation; Ellen and Artturi Nyyssonen Foundation; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission,"We are grateful to Cesilie Lien, Laina Dalsbo, Emmanuela Daza Secco and other people helping with the field and laboratory work.

However, social and ecological factors responsible for interspecific differences in male's share of parental duties remain unclear. Genetic fidelity of females has been long considered important. Theory predicts that females should receive more help from their mates in raising the offspring in species with high genetic fidelity. Using avian incubation behaviour as a model system, we confirmed this prediction. The extent of male's help during incubation increased with decreasing rate of extra-pair paternity across species (22 species of socially monogamous songbirds from 13 families; male's share of incubation ranged from 6% to 58%), even after accounting for covariates, biases in species selection and intraspecific variability. Moreover, this result was not sensitive to two different phylogenies and branch length estimates. We suggest that our findings support the notion, backed by theory, that genetic fidelity is an important factor in the evolution of male parental care. We offer several behavioural scenarios for the coevolution between male's share of parental duties and the genetic mating system.","[Matysiokova, B.; Remes, V.] Palacky Univ, Ornithol Lab, Dept Zool, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic; [Matysiokova, B.] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Inst Zool, Poznan, Poland","Matysiokova, B (corresponding author), Palacky Univ, Ornithol Lab, Dept Zool, Tr Svobody 26, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic.",betynec@centrum.cz,"Remes, Vladimir/B-6842-2016",,,,,106,27,28,1,165,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1010-061X,1420-9101,,J EVOLUTION BIOL,J.

We used a zooplankton metacommunity to ask how dispersal, genetic drift and selection act to determine the local and regional distributions of trait variation. Since the formation of the lakes 80 years ago, cladoceran species have sorted into local assemblages that cluster by lake depth. Given this species sorting, we ask whether intraspecific variation in an ecologically important phenotypic trait body size has sorted as well. 2. We quantified changes in body size through time by measuring ephippia from D.similar to pulicaria, D.similar to dentifera and D.similar to ambigua recovered from sediment cores from two lakes. We then estimated mean body size of contemporary populations of two competing species, Daphnia pulicaria and D.similar to dentifera, in a laboratory common garden experiment. Finally, we used microsatellite loci to characterise genetic diversity and gene flow among local sites in the metacommunity. 3. Body size was variable both within and among years for the three species of Daphnia examined using sediment cores. For two lakes where we examined body size distributions through time, we observed a significant shift in body size of the first species to arrive after colonisation by other Daphnia species, which suggests selection has occurred historically. 4. Despite heritable variation in body size in the laboratory, evidence for trait sorting was only found for D.similar to pulicaria, which was larger in deeper lakes. Mean body size varied among lakes, but did not sort relative to depth for D.similar to dentifera. 5. Microsatellite data indicated that neutral genetic diversity was low in the region; only 27% of the individuals assayed were unique multi-locus genotypes. We also found significant patterns of isolation by distance for both species. However, population structure was stronger in D.similar to dentifera than in D.similar to pulicaria. Hence, we conclude that a limited number of colonists have successfully invaded this metacommunity, and those genotypes arriving in this new region have experienced significant dispersal limitation among local sites. 6. Overall, while dispersal and selection have clearly led to the development of predictable community assemblages related to depth in this metacommunity, the distribution of phenotypic traits within species can differ substantially even between two trophically similar species.

Economic analyses have shown that territories of animals are structured by trade-offs between benefits gained from resources and costs of defending them. Intuitively, home ranges should be similarly structured, but trade-offs are difficult to assess because there are no costs of defense, thus economic models of home-range behavior are rare. We present economic models that predict how home ranges can be efficient with respect to spatially distributed resources, discounted for travel costs, under 2 strategies of optimization, resource maximization and area minimization. We show how constraints such as competitors can influence structure of homes ranges through resource depression, ultimately structuring density of animals within a population and their distribution on a landscape. We present simulations based on these models to show how they can be generally predictive of home-range behavior and the mechanisms that structure the spatial distribution of animals. We also show how contiguous home ranges estimated statistically from location data can be misleading for animals that optimize home ranges on landscapes with patchily distributed resources. We conclude with a summary of how we applied our models to nonterritorial black bears (Ursus americanus) living in the mountains of North Carolina, where we found their home ranges were best predicted by an area-minimization strategy constrained by intraspecific competition within a social hierarchy. Economic models can provide strong inference about home-range behavior and the resources that structure home ranges by offering falsifiable, a priori hypotheses that can be tested with field observations.","[Mitchell, Michael S.] Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Powell, Roger A.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Zool, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Mitchell, MS (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, 205 Nat Sci Bldg, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",mike.mitchell@umontana.edu,,,"Auburn University's Peaks of Excellence Program; Auburn University's Center for Forest Sustainability; Citibank Corp.; Columbus Zoo Conservation Fund; Geraldine R.

Yet individually and collectively, these hypotheses fail to address the simultaneous influence of all three factors. Here we review existing hypotheses, and propose the tri-trophic interactions (TTI) hypothesis to consolidate and integrate their predictions. The TTI hypothesis predicts that dietary specialist herbivores (as compared to generalists) should escape predators and be competitively dominant due to faster growth rates, and that such differences should be greater on low quality (as compared to high quality) host plants. To provide a preliminary test of these predictions, we conducted an empirical study comparing the effects of plant (Baccharis salicifolia) quality and predators between a specialist (Uroleucon macolai) and a generalist (Aphis gossypii) aphid herbivore. Consistent with predictions, these three factors interactively determine herbivore performance in ways not addressed by existing hypotheses. Compared to the specialist, the generalist was less fecund, competitively inferior, and more sensitive to low plant quality. Correspondingly, predator effects were contingent upon plant quality only for the generalist. Contrary to predictions, predator effects were weaker for the generalist and on low-quality plants, likely due to density-dependent benefits provided to the generalist by mutualist ants. Because the TTI hypothesis predicts the superior performance of specialists, mutualist ants may be critical to A. gossypii persistence under competition from U. macolai. In summary, the integrative nature of the TTI hypothesis offers novel insight into the determinants of plant-herbivore and herbivore-predator interactions and the coexistence of specialist and generalist herbivores.","[Mooney, Kailen A.; Pratt, Riley T.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Singer, Michael S.] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Biol, Middletown, CT 06459 USA","Mooney, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",mooneyk@uci.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0919178, DEB-1120794]; University of California Irvine Academic Senate Council on Research, Computing and Libraries","This work was funded by National Science Foundation grants DEB-0919178 and DEB-1120794, the University of California Irvine Academic Senate Council on Research, Computing and Libraries.

The study of elevational range limits is central to understanding this widespread pattern and to predicting the responses of montane species to climate change. Yet, because large-scale manipulations of the distributions of most species are difficult, the causes of species elevational range limits (e.g. competitive interactions, physiological specialization) are poorly understood. Here, we harness the power of new mechanistic approaches to dissect the factors that underlie the elevational replacement of two salamander species in the Appalachian Highlands. Our results challenge the long-held idea that competitive interactions drive the lower elevational range limits of montane species and that physiological stress prevents low-elevation species from expanding to high elevations. We show that physiological constraints drive the lower elevational range limit of the montane-endemic species, Plethodon jordani. Conversely, we find that competition with P. jordani prevents the low-elevation species, P. teyahalee, from expanding its range to include higher-elevation habitats. These results are broadly consistent with the biogeography and behavior of other montane species, suggesting that similar mechanisms underlie patterns of elevational zonation across a variety of taxa and montane regions. To the extent that our findings are taxonomically and geographically widespread, these results challenge the idea that competitive release at species lower elevational range limits is driving the downslope range shifts exhibit by some montane taxa. Instead, our results raise the sobering possibility that even small changes in climate might cause erosion of the ranges of many high-elevation species.","[Gifford, Matthew E.; Kozak, Kenneth H.] Univ Minnesota, Bell Museum Nat Hist, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Kozak, Kenneth H.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Gifford, ME (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol, Little Rock, AR 72204 USA.",megifford@ualr.edu,"Gifford, Matthew/C-9500-2012","Gifford, Matthew/0000-0003-1263-0010","U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0949038, DEB-0824599, DEB-0949590]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0949038] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank L.

In the Great Lakes, competition with nonnative salmonids may be hindering the restoration efforts of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, a once-native top predator in Lake Ontario. We examined the effects of brown trout S. trutta and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, two nonnative fishes in Lake Ontario, on the social dominance and growth rate of juvenile Atlantic salmon from three strains being used for reintroduction efforts in Lake Ontario. Using seminatural stream channels, we found that the presence of either rainbow trout or brown trout reduced aggression, dominance, and food consumption of the Atlantic salmon. Brown trout had the strongest effect, increasing aggression levels in the channels by a factor of two and sharply reducing the dominance of Atlantic salmon. When both nonnatives were present, initiated aggression by Atlantic salmon decreased by a factor of three and food consumption halved as compared with when the salmon were alone. Consequently, over a 7-d time period, standard growth rate of the Atlantic salmon dropped from no change in mass when alone to a value of -0.3% per day when with the nonnative species. Of the three strains tested, one strain was least affected by the nonnative trouts, implicating genetic differences among the strains and suggesting that one strain may have greater poststocking success in Lake Ontario tributaries with naturalized populations of brown trout and rainbow trout.","[Van Zwol, Jessica A.; Neff, Bryan D.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Wilson, Chris C.] Trent Univ, Aquat Res & Dev Sect, Ontario Minist Nat Resources, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada","Neff, BD (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",bneff@uwo.ca,"Wilson, Chris C/J-4851-2012","Wilson, Chris C/0000-0002-9528-0652",World Wildlife Fund-Canada; Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"We gratefully acknowledge the support of World Wildlife Fund-Canada and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.

We test these ideas in a vertebrate group that is a model for competition and evolutionary studies by assessing the scale-dependence of BSFDs. BSFDs (body size defined as maximum total length) of North American squamates were assembled for the entire continent, biomes within the continent and local habitat patches within biomes. We described these distributions using skewness, kurtosis, interquartile range (IQR), and an index of evenness. We compared these parameters among spatial scales using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and bootstrap simulations. We assessed the relationship between body size and species richness using correlations (Pearsons and Spearmans R). The North American BSFD is bimodal, with a primary mode (240 mm) corresponding to lizards and small snakes and a secondary mode (912 mm) to snakes. Squamate BSFDs varied in a scale dependent fashion for some biomes and local habitat patches for kurtosis (12% of local patches and 10% of biomes more platykurtic), skewness (30% of biomes skewed to the right) and IQR (12% of patches increased). The index of evenness of BSFDs did not vary with spatial scale. Body size of biomes and local habitat patches closely resembles the North American BSFD as species richness increases. We found limited statistical support for the scale-dependency of North American squamate BSFDs (only 12-30% of patches or biomes conformed to the predicted pattern). These results suggest that the mechanisms implicated in scale-dependent patterns of BSFDs for mammals, geographic turnover of modal-sized species and competition within local assemblages may be of diminished importance in squamates. As geographic turnover of modal-sized species is theoretically linked to an evolutionarily optimal body size, this may suggest that optimal size theory is not adequate to predict spatial scaling of BSFDs in squamates.","[Cox, Christian L.] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, Arlington, TX 76010 USA; [Boback, Scott M.] Dickinson Coll, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA; [Guyer, Craig] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Cox, CL (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Biol, 501 S Nedderman Dr, Arlington, TX 76010 USA.",clcox@uta.edu,,,,,,71,7,7,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0071-3260,1934-2845,,EVOL BIOL,Evol.

Muskrat populations have been reduced in some streams where North American river otters (Lontra canadensis) were reintroduced, and it has been hypothesized that otter reintroduction could be used as a tool for conservation of mussels. We used occupancy estimation methods to evaluate the ecological relationship between muskrats and otters by collecting presence-absence data based on field sign found at bridge crossings in eastern and central Kentucky. Mean detection probabilities (ps) and occupancy probabilities (psi s) for muskrats were 0.692 (SE = 0.045) and 0.723 (SE = 0.071) and for otters were 0.623 (SE = 0.036) and 0.662 (SE = 0.069), respectively. Otter occupancy was related negatively to distance from release sites, which suggests that the otter population is still expanding its range. A 2-species interaction model indicated that the occupancy by muskrats and river otters was independent, and we conclude that river otter reintroduction would not be an effective strategy for conserving mussels.","[Williamson, Ryan] Univ Tennessee, Dept Forestry Wildlife & Fisheries, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Clark, Joseph D.] Univ Tennessee, US Geol Survey, Leetaon Sci Ctr, So Appalachian Res Branch, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Clark, JD (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Forestry Wildlife & Fisheries, 274 Ellington Plant Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",jclark1@utk.edu,,,"United States Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; National Park Service; University of Tennessee, Knoxville","Funding for this project was provided by the United States Geological Survey, the National Park Service, and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

It also supports a high biodiversity of endemic rocky intertidal species. Although the distributions of many of these species were qualitatively described several decades ago, little quantitative data on abundance, distribution and diversity has been collected across a range of spatial scales from local to biogeographical. Without such data it is difficult to assess range dynamics and connectivity of endemic and climate-sensitive species and assemblages, and thus predict responses to future impacts of climate warming, sea level rise, coastal squeeze and ocean acidification. This paper documents the geographic distributions, abundances and assemblage patterns of intertidal limpets at 63 sites around the New Zealand coast. Limpets are key functional components of most temperate ecosystems, influencing patterns of invertebrate-macroalgal dominance, carbon cycling and biodiversity. In contrast to continental-scale studies in other temperate systems, limpet assemblages were not more similar at the level of the biogeographic province, and only weak associations were found with biogeographic region. Limpet assemblages did differ between sites, but no spatial pattern was evident. Species distributions and assemblage structures did also not appear to be strongly influenced by environmental factors including temperature, coverage of key structural taxa including barnacles, mussels and macroalgae, or other potentially competing grazers. Limpet diversity was highest at some exposed locations, but there was no national trend. In general, the high variability we observed in individual species abundances at local, regional and biogeographic scales suggests that small scale, local factors rather than broad biogeographic drivers determine New Zealand rocky intertidal limpet assemblages. This creates a challenge for ecological forecasting of future responses to global environmental change. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We analysed the relationship between biodiversity and individual performance by focusing on vocal mimicry, a widespread interaction that may serve in intra-and interspecific communication. We studied the songs of two lark species (genus Galerida) that increase the complexity of their song displays by mimicking other birds, and analysed the influence of bird species richness on individual song performance. The diversity of mimicked species and the prevalence of mimicry increased in areas characterized by great a and g diversity (i.e. where larks experience more diverse encounters with community members, many of them being highly vocal owing to breeding). Conversely, the variability in species-specific song components peaked where larks were abundant, probably matching the complexity of conspecific social milieu. Some trade-offs existed between homo-and heterospecific complexity, suggesting that larks could change from population-to community-driven song variation by tracking the composition of the auditory environment. Mimicry, which serves communication with conspecifics or predators, may mediate interactions, ultimately cascading to aspects of ecological diversity other than those promoting its complexity.","[Laiolo, Paola; Ramon Obeso, Jose] CSIC, ICAB, Oviedo 33071, Spain; [Laiolo, Paola; Ramon Obeso, Jose] Univ Oviedo, E-33071 Oviedo, Spain; [Roggia, Yari] Univ Turin, Dept Anim Biol, I-10123 Turin, Italy","Laiolo, P (corresponding author), CSIC, ICAB, Oviedo 33071, Spain.",paola.laiolo@gmail.com,"Laiolo, Paola/Q-3747-2019; Laiolo, Paola/B-6566-2014","Laiolo, Paola/0000-0002-2009-6797; Laiolo, Paola/0000-0002-2009-6797; Obeso-Suarez, Jose Ramon/0000-0001-7157-6478",Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [CGL2008-02 749],"We are grateful to Jordi Moya for discussing with us the results of this study, and to Andrew Radford, Eben Goodale and an anonymous referee for their valuable comments and suggestions.

However, quantifying habitat quality is problematic because it may comprise of abiotic components at different spatial scales and also be influenced by biotic processes. This study investigated the relationship between reef-associated Caribbean fishes and habitat quality at 2 spatial scales: (1) multiple characteristics of Montastraea annularis coral colonies (<1 m(2)) and (2) coral density in a 5 x 5 m plot around each microhabitat. Furthermore, the influence on habitat quality of 2 biotic factors (predation pressure and interactions between competitively superior territorial damselfishes and other species) was considered. A total of 102 M. annularis colonies within thirty 25 m(2) plots were surveyed on a Belizean forereef. Generalised linear mixed-effect models demonstrated that both damselfishes and other reef associated species were correlated with colony-scale habitat quality (more abundant on taller, refuge-rich colonies). Adult reef-associated species were also correlated with larger-scale habitat quality, being more abundant on colonies with high densities of other Montastraea colonies within 25 m(2) (probably higher quality home ranges). However, the presence of damselfishes was associated with reduced abundances of other reef-associated species on M. annularis colonies, reflecting the importance of both biotic and abiotic controls of habitat quality. On reefs, coral mortality will reduce the density of optimal colonies and potentially increase the proportion occupied by damselfishes. This may lead to smaller populations of inferior competitors as they are increasingly displaced onto sub-optimal microhabitats.","[Harborne, Alastair R.; Kennedy, Emma V.] Univ Exeter, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Hatherly Lab, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; [Harborne, Alastair R.; Mumby, Peter J.; Ferrari, Renata] Univ Queensland, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","Harborne, AR (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Hatherly Lab, Prince Wales Rd, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",a.r.harborne@ex.ac.uk,"Mumby, Peter/F-9914-2010; Harborne, Alastair R/F-6155-2013; Ferrari, Renata/E-3109-2016; Kennedy, Emma V/M-3193-2014","Mumby, Peter/0000-0002-6297-9053; Harborne, Alastair R/0000-0002-6818-8615; Ferrari, Renata/0000-0002-5056-1178; Kennedy, Emma V/0000-0003-1821-9740",Global Environment Facility; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/F015704/1]; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/G017344/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"This study was funded by the Global Environment Facility's Coral Reef Targeted Research, awarded to P.J.M.

Here, we show that water flow has a net positive effect on the biodiversity of benthic invertebrate communities in three biogeographic regions. In Palau and Alaska, flow velocity predicted 55-91% of the variance in species richness in natural communities. In experimental communities in Alaska and Maine, enhanced water flow treatments resulted in higher levels of species density (+56%) and richness (+74%), which were predicted by the abundance of locally rare species. Additionally, the richness of recruitment was higher in experimentally enhanced flows (+46%). Thus, the data suggest that flow drives diversity by mediating the delivery of rare species in multiple biogeographic regions. Consequently, flow velocity should be included in future developments of diversity theory and conservation strategy.","[Palardy, James E.; Witman, Jon D.] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Palardy, JE (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 80 Waterman St,Box G-W, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",palardy@gmail.com,"Palardy, James/L-9092-2019","Palardy, James/0000-0002-8347-7108",,,,50,41,42,4,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Heteromyids cache seeds throughout their home ranges, either concentrated in I location (larder hoard) or in multiple, small seed piles (scatter hoards). To minimize cache pilferage by other rodents, coexisting species may scatter hoard seeds in distinct microhabitats. We examined interspecific differences in caching and pilfering behaviors of 3 coexisting heteromyid rodents, Merriam's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami), the pale kangaroo mouse (Microdipodops pallidus), and the little pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris), to determine if caching microhabitat affects likelihood of pilferage. In outdoor enclosures we tracked cache placement and measured pilferage of artificial caches using radiolabeled Indian ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides) seeds. M. pallidus and P. longimembris placed seed caches mostly under shrubs, whereas D. merriami placed caches predominately in open microhabitat. However, D. merriami showed a significant preference for pilfering caches under shrubs, whereas P. longimembris did not show a significant preference for pilfering caches in either open or undershrub microhabitats. The 2 species pilfered similar numbers of caches. Coexisting heteroymid rodent species may contribute to spatial heterogeneity of available resources by caching in different microhabitats, thereby reducing but not eliminating cache pilferage by other species.

Species deletion from communities can trigger cascading extinction events, with strong evidence from empirical and theoretical work. I examined model competitive communities, sequentially assembled using species drawn from a global pool with interaction strengths described by different distribution shapes (uniform or beta), with the same mean and variance. As community size increased, it became harder to assemble communities drawn from a uniform distribution compared to a beta distribution. The distribution of interaction values in the assembled communities differed from the shape of the initial distribution. The distribution shape and the relative abundance of the deleted species also had strong impacts on the probability of extinction cascades following primary species removal. Extinction cascades occurred in communities with a higher mean and variance of interaction strengths before the primary extinction. Those species lost had negative equilibrium densities and tended to be the least abundant, when assessed following the reorganisation that occurred after the primary and subsequent extinctions. Knowledge of the shape of the distribution of interaction strengths from real communities will allow us to make better predictions about which species are most at risk in extinction cascades under natural circumstances.","[Fowler, Mike S.] Univ Helsinki, Integrat Ecol Unit, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Fowler, MS (corresponding author), UiB CSIC, Populat Ecol Grp, IMEDEA, C Miquel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Spain.",mfowler@imedea.uib-csic.es,"Fowler, Mike/H-5092-2013","Fowler, Mike/0000-0003-1544-0407",NCoE EcoClim,"Thanks to Sami Aikio, Andreas Linden, Lasse Ruokolainen, Veijo Kaitala, Esa Ranta and Per Lundberg for discussions on community interactions and/or comments on the MS.

We studied the effect of the presence of conspecific larvae and their tracks on the oviposition site selection of an aphid- specific predator, Episyrphus balteatus DeGeer ( Diptera: Syrphidae), in two-choice experiments using a leaf disc bioassay. Gas chromatography - mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify the volatile chemicals released from odour extracts of E. balteatus larval tracks. The behavioural effects of these volatile substances on hoverfly females were also evaluated. Our experiments demonstrated that E. balteatus females were deterred from ovipositing when presented with a Vicia faba leaf with aphids and conspecific larvae. The oviposition-deterring stimulus was also active when females were presented with a leaf that contained conspecific larval tracks. A mixture of chemical compounds was found in the volatile pattern of odour extracts of larval tracks. The main volatile chemicals were 3-methylbutanoic acid, 2-methylbutanoic acid, 2-methylpropanoic acid, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, hexanoic acid and phenol. Females also laid significantly fewer eggs in response to odorant volatiles emitted from larval extracts. These results highlight that predatory hoverfly females avoid ovipositing in aphid colonies in which conspecific larvae or their tracks are already present, suggesting that this behaviour constitutes a strategy that enables females to optimize their oviposition site and reduce competition suffered by their offspring.

However, little is known about factors other than predation, which are associated with the loss of island biodiversity. We report that introduced Ship Rats Ratios ratios constructed arboreal dome-shaped nests and secondarily used open-cup nests of the Bull-headed Shrike Lanius bucephalus for roosting or rearing young in trees within hedgerows along sugarcane fields of Minami-daito Island (northwest Pacific). We found that temporal nest utilization by Ship Rats forced Bull-headed Shrikes to abandon their nests before egg-laying. We suggest that kleptoparasitism applies to the interaction between Bull-headed Shrikes and Ship Rats, which usurp shrike nests during their breeding period.

The models differ in two main aspects: whether they include direct competition among parasites and whether the analysis is based on some approximation and which one. If the analysis is not constrained by a priori assumptions about parasite distributions, it is found that species coexistence is very unlikely without some kind of direct competition among parasites; on the other hand, coexistence generally occurs when inter-specific competition is lower than intraspecific, similarly to standard theory for free-living species. If hosts differ in their predisposition to infection, but not in an identical way towards the two parasite species, then species coexistence becomes feasible even if inter-specific competition is as strong as intraspecific; in this case, coexistence becomes easier as the variance in predisposition increases. These models do not yield universal predictions for patterns of parasite distributions; an analysis of the mechanisms of interaction in each specific system is necessary for that.","Univ Trent, Dipartimento Matemat, I-38050 Trento, Italy","Pugliese, A (corresponding author), Univ Trent, Dipartimento Matemat, Via Sommarive 14, I-38050 Trento, Italy.",pugliese@science.unitn.it,"Pugliese, Andrea/E-1905-2011","Pugliese, Andrea/0000-0002-3512-8560",,,,33,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0065-2598,,978-1-4419-6063-4,ADV EXP MED BIOL,Adv.Exp.Med.Biol.,,2010,673,,,,,,32,50,,,10.1007/978-1-4419-6064-1,,19,"Medicine, Research & Experimental",Research & Experimental Medicine,BOO44,WOS:000277148900003,20632528,,,,2021-09-21,

Although phenotypic divergence and speciation have often been inferred to be the primary consequences of the release from competition or predation that accompanies a shift to a new adaptive zone, increased phenotypic variation within species is expected to represent the first stage resulting from such a shift. Using measures of intraspecific morphological variation of 30 species of Galapagos endemic land snails in a phylogenetically controlled framework, we show that the number of local congeners and the number of local plant species are associated with lower and higher intraspecific phenotypic variation, respectively. In this clade, ecological opportunity thus explicitly links the role of competition from congeners and the heterogeneity of resources to the extent of intraspecific phenotypic divergence as adaptive radiation proceeds.","[Parent, Christine E.; Crespi, Bernard J.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Behav Ecol Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Parent, CE (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",cparent@mail.utexas.edu,"Parent, Christine E/H-7482-2019",,Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"We thank D.

It is not known how these factors drive arctic fox population trends. To test their role in arctic fox decline, we developed a spatially explicit and individual-based model that allowed us to simulate fox interactions and food availability in a real landscape. A sensitivity analysis revealed that simulated arctic fox population size and den occupancy were strongly correlated with fecundity and mortality during the microtine crash phase, but also with red fox status. Model simulations suggested that arctic fox population trends depended on microtine cycles and that arctic fox distributions were restricted by red fox presence. We compared the model predictions with field data collected at Vindelfjallen, Sweden. The model recreated the observed arctic fox trend only with the inclusion of arctic fox avoidance of red fox home ranges. The results indicate that avoidance behaviours can affect population trends and hence that relatively small numbers of red foxes can have a strong negative impact on arctic fox population size and distribution.","[Shirley, Mark D.

The two objectives were (a) to compare pea-barley intercropping to sole cropping in terms of grain and nitrogen yield amounts and stability, and (b) to explore options for managing pea-barley intercropping systems in order to maximize the biomass produced and the grain and nitrogen yields according to the available resources, such as light, water and nitrogen. The study consisted of simulations taking into account soil and weather variability among three sites located in northern European Countries (Denmark, United Kingdom and France), and using 10 years of weather records. A preliminary stage evaluated the STICS intercrop model's ability to predict grain and nitrogen yields of the two species, using a 2-year dataset from trials conducted at the three sites. The work was carried out in two phases, (a) the model was run to investigate the potentialities of intercrops as compared to sole crops, and (b) the model was run to explore options for managing pea-barley intercropping, asking the following three questions: (i) in order to increase light capture, Would it be worth delaying the sowing dates of one species? (ii) How to manage sowing density and seed proportion of each species in the intercrop to improve total grain yield and N use efficiency? (iii) How to optimize the use of nitrogen resources by choosing the most suitable preceding crop and/or the most appropriate soil? It was found that (1) intercropping made better use of environmental resources as regards yield amount and stability than sole cropping, with a noticeable site effect, (2) pea growth in intercrops was strongly linked to soil moisture, and barley yield was determined by nitrogen uptake and light interception due to its height relative to pea, (3) sowing barley before pea led to a relative grain yield reduction averaged over all three sites, but sowing strategy must be adapted to the location, being dependent on temperature and thus latitude, (4) density and species proportions had a small effect on total grain yield, underlining the interspecific offset in the use of environmental growth resources which led to similar total grain yields whatever the pea-barley design, and (5) long-term strategies including mineralization management through organic residue supply and rotation management were very valuable, always favoring intercrop total grain yield and N accumulation.

As an example of such intra-guild competition, we investigated sett (den)-site selection by two sympatric species of badger, the Chinese ferret badger (Melogale moschata) and the hog badger (Arctonyx collaris) in Houhe National Nature Reserve, central China. As members of the same guild we predicted that competition should occur between these species; and that their relationship along various niche dimensions should be affected by their five-fold difference in body size. We tested mechanisms facilitating coexistence in terms of sett sites at two spatio-temporal scales: (1) habitat selection; (2) internal den-microhabitat conditions. Logistic regression models revealed that ferret badgers selected sites characterized by dense, species-diverse shrub cover, low elevation and low tree cover. Discriminant function analysis revealed that these primary differences were attributable to slope angle, shrub cover and human activity. Niche overlap value, in terms of sett-site characteristics, was 0.359 (values in excess of 0.6 often limit viable coexistence). At the microclimatic scale, both the absolute, and range, of temperature Values within setts also differed significantly between M. moschata and A. collaris. Our findings for these little-known, co-existing badger species provide evidence for two mechanisms (trade-off in relative abilities to exploit different habitats and microhabitat) facilitating niche separation, with regard to den site selection.","[Zhang, L.; Jiang, P. -P.; Ding, P.] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Y. -B.] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Inst Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Newman, C.; Macdonald, D.

In coastal habitats surrounding Jervis Bay in south-eastern Australia, R. rattus co-occurs with the native bush rat, Rattus fuscipes, and brown antechinus, Antechinus stuartii. Relative distributions and abundances, and fine-scale space use suggest invasive and native rodents compete for use of space and habitat. Such competitive interactions were not evident between R. rattus and native A. stuartii, which was negatively influenced more by disturbance to habitat. Differences in rodent communities between spatially separate forests forming the northern and southern peninsulas of Jervis Bay potentially reflect symmetrical competition and differences in competitive outcomes. In southern forests, R. rattus was largely restricted to patches of disturbed forest associated with campgrounds. Competitive interference by native rodent populations inhabiting surrounding intact forests may have so far limited R. rattus colonization of these areas. In northern forests, R. rattus was the predominant rodent irrespective of disturbance, while populations of R. fuscipes were unusually low seemingly due to poor juvenile recruitment. Native individuals avoided areas frequented by adult R. rattus and given that species did not partition use of microhabitats, R. rattus most likely precluded R. Juscipes from suitable habitat and in doing so limited native populations. We discuss how natural disturbance of habitat and human activity have potentially facilitated successful invasion by R. rattus of the northern forests. Studies that manipulate rodent populations are required to support these interpretations of observed patterns.","[Stokes, Vicki L.; Williams, Richard L.] CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Stokes, Vicki L.; Banks, Peter B.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Pech, Roger P.] Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand","Stokes, VL (corresponding author), Alcoa Australia, Res Dept, Huntly, WA 6208, Australia.",vicki.stokes@bigpond.com,,"Banks, Peter/0000-0002-4340-6495",,,,58,18,21,0,43,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1442-9985,,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,JUN,2009,34,4,,,,,395,408,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2009.01941.x,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,473HD,WOS:000268196000005,,,,,2021-09-21,

The objective of this study was to use CROPGRO-cotton, a process-based model, to simulate cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production under different levels of light in a pecan (Carya illinoensis K. Koch) alleycropping system in Jay, Florida, USA. Soil classification in the area was Red Bay sandy loam soil (Rhodic Paleudult). To separate roots of cotton and pecan, polyethylene-lined trenches were installed parallel to tree rows, thus competition for water and nutrients was assumed to be non-existent. Four treatments were set up in the CROPGRO-cotton model, as follows: (1) control (full amount of light transmittance), (2) Row 1 (50% light transmittance), (3) Row 4 (55% light transmittance), and (4) Row 8 (70% light transmittance). Cotton model parameters affecting specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area index (LAI), maximum leaf photosynthetic rate (FLMAX) and carbon partitioning were calibrated using the full sun treatment. Measurements of SLA, LAI, and aboveground biomass were made on the different shaded treatments and compared with simulated values. Simulation results showed that aboveground mechanisms affecting production in shaded environment (i.e., SLA, LAI, LFMAX, and carbon partitioning) influence model behavior. After calibration, the model predicted SLA of cotton in all treatments with reasonable precision. However, LAI was underestimated in the more shaded treatment rows 4 and 8. Generally, the model provided a close agreement between measured and simulated biomass both in 2001 and 2002 (R (2) = 0.95 and R (2) = 0.92, respectively). In 2001, predicted biomass for the control was 5,401 kg ha(-1) compared to the measured value of 5,393 kg ha(-1). A similar trend was also observed in 2002. The CROPGRO-Cotton model was able to describe variations in growth among the shaded treatments well across both growing seasons. However, it was found that additional research is needed to improve the model's ability to simulate LAI under shading conditions. Parameters associated with photosynthesis and dry matter partitioning were reasonably stable across shading treatments and years but those associated with leaf area growth varied.","[Zamora, Diomides S.; Jose, Shibu; Cropper, Wendell P., Jr.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Jones, James W.] Univ Florida, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Zamora, Diomides S.] Univ Minnesota Extens, Brainerd, MN 56401 USA","Jose, S (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, 118 Newins Ziegler Hall,POB 110410, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",sjose@ufl.edu,"Jones, James/AAP-9048-2020; Cropper, Wendell P/E-5952-2010","Jones, James/0000-0002-3239-8960; Cropper, Wendell P/0000-0001-7851-7382",Center of Subtropical Agroforestry (CSTAF) [00-52103-9702]; USDA Southern Region Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education [LS02-136],"Special thanks are extended to the simulation modeling group of the Agricultural and Biological Engineering Department, University of Florida, especially to Dr. Carlos Messina, McNair Bostick and Valerie Walen for their helpful input in running the model.

Typically, emphasis is on pattern emulation, and less on processes, such as competition, predation or habitat selection. Knowing how communities in the boreal forest assemble can provide further insight to the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on the processes responsible, permitting assessments about whether forestry practices emulate processes as well as patterns. We contrasted variation in species richness among forest types, with stand area, and between local (forest stand) and regional (landscape) scales on managed and natural boreal landscapes in NW Ontario. Species richness varied more among forest stand types than between landscapes, or with stand area, on either landscape. On both landscapes, mean local species richness was 1/3 of regional richness, consistent with the hypothesis that competition structured stand-level assemblages regardless of stand origin. We further compared the structure of stand-level assemblages from randomized null models using presence/absence and abundance data with observed assemblages on each landscape, while controlling for variation in habitat structure among stands. Local bird assemblages were over-dispersed in niche space relative to random assemblages, also consistent with the competition hypothesis, regardless of stand origin. We found no evidence that patterns of variation in diversity of songbirds and woodpeckers, nor the processes that govern them, differed between managed and natural boreal forest landscapes. Our results suggest that past forest practices in this region, if by default, nevertheless emulated natural patterns of variation in diversity and species assembly of bird communities.","[Wyshynski, Sarah A.; Nudds, Thomas D.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Nudds, TD (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",tnudds@uoguelph.ca,,,Network of Centres of Excellence; The Canadian Forest Service and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources,"We thank Ian Thompson, James Baker, and John Fryxell for inviting our collaboration with the Marten Project in Ear Falls.

However, the stability of ecological networks may be more dependent on the way different interaction types are combined in real communities. To address this issue, we start by compiling an ecological network in the Donana Biological Reserve, southern Spain, with 390 species and 798 mu-tualistic and antagonistic interactions. We characterize network structure by looking at how mutualistic and antagonistic interactions are combined across all plant species. Both the ratio of mutualistic to antagonistic interactions per plant, and the number of basic modules with an antagonistic and a mutualistic interaction are very heterogeneous across plant species, with a few plant species showing very high values for these parameters. To assess the implications of these network patterns on species diversity, we study analytically and by simulation a model of this ecological network. We find that the observed correlation between strong interaction strengths and high mutualistic to antagonistic ratios in a few plant species significantly increases community diversity. Thus, to predict the persistence of biodiversity we need to understand how interaction strength and the architecture of ecological networks with different interaction types are combined.","[Melian, Carlos J.; Bascompte, Jordi; Jordano, Pedro] CSIC, Estac Biol Donana, ES-41080 Seville, Spain; [Melian, Carlos J.; Krivan, Vlastimil] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA; [Krivan, Vlastimil] Biol Ctr AS CR, Inst Entomol, Dept Theoret Ecol, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic","Melian, CJ (corresponding author), CSIC, Estac Biol Donana, Apdo 1056, ES-41080 Seville, Spain.",melian@nceas.ucsb.edu,"Melian, Carlos/C-2146-2008; Melian, Carlos/AAZ-2026-2020; Krivan, Vlastimil/F-1709-2010; Jordano, Pedro/A-5162-2008; Bascompte, Jordi/B-7596-2008; Krivan, Vlastimil/J-7015-2019","Melian, Carlos/0000-0003-3974-6515; Melian, Carlos/0000-0003-3974-6515; Krivan, Vlastimil/0000-0003-0971-1231; Jordano, Pedro/0000-0003-2142-9116; Bascompte, Jordi/0000-0002-0108-6411; ","Postdoctoral and a Sabatical Fellowship; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0553768]; Univ. of California at Santa Barbara; Santa Barbara campus; Grant Agency of the Czech Academy of SciencesGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [IAA100070601]; Spanish Ministry of Science and TechnologySpanish Government [REN200304774, REN2003-00273]; European Heads of Research Councils; European Science FoundationEuropean Science Foundation (ESF)European Commission; EC Sixth Framework Programme through a EURYI (European Young Investigator) awardEuropean Commission","This paper is dedicated to the memory of J.

We conducted an experiment to evaluate how pond hydroperiod affected the ability of two larval anuran species (Hyla squirella and Bufo terrestris) to interact with intraspecific and interspecific competitors. Pond hydroperiod altered how an increase in the abundance of intraspecific competitors affected fitness components of B. terrestris but not for H. squirella. Specifically, an increase in intraspecific abundance caused a reduction in B. terrestris survivorship in short hydroperiod ponds but had no effect on fitness components of B. terrestris in long hydroperiod ponds. Interspecific competition did not occur between these species in either short or long hydroperiod ponds. Our study highlights the point that the strength of density-dependent processes operating in the aquatic environment can depend on pond hydroperiod. Consequently, the extent to which processes operating in the aquatic environment contribute to the regulation of population and metapopulation size for amphibians will also likely depend on pond hydroperiod.","[Rogers, Tracy Noel; Chalcraft, David R.] E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA","Chalcraft, DR (corresponding author), E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",chalcraftd@ecu.edu,,"Chalcraft, David/0000-0002-2165-0948",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0716558],"This work was completed in partial fulfillment of the degree requirements for a Master of Science degree at East Carolina University.

The aim of this study was to use this highly specific host-parasite systems to review: (1) the diversity and distribution of Dactylogyrus species, (2) the patterns of organization and structure of Dactylogyrus communities, (3) the evolution and determinants of host specificity and (4) the mode of Dactylogyrus speciation and co-evolutionary patterns in this Dactylogyrus-cyprinid systems. Dactylogyrus are a highly diverse group of parasites, with their biogeography and distribution clearly linked to the evolutionary history of their cyprinid hosts. The coexistence of several Dactylogyrus species on one host is facilitated by increasing niche distances and the differing morphology of their reproductive organs. The positive interspecific and intraspecific interactions seem to be the most important factors determining the structure of Dactylogyrus communities. Host specificity is partially constrained by parasite phylogeny. Being a strict specialist is an ancestral character for Dactylogyrus, being the intermediate specialists or generalists are the derived characters. The evolution of attachment organ morphology is associated with both parasite phylogeny and host specificity. Considering larger and long-lived hosts or hosts with several ecological characters as the measures of resource predictability, specialists with larger anchors occurred on larger or longer-living fish species. Intra-host speciation, a mode of speciation not often recorded in parasites, was observed in Dactylogyrus infecting sympatric cyprinids. Sister parasite species coexisting on the same host occupied niches that differed in at least one niche variable. Intra-host speciation, however, was not observed in Dactylogyrus species of congeneric hosts from geographically isolated areas, which suggested association by descent and host-switching events.","[Simkova, A.] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic; [Morand, S.] Univ Montpellier 2, CNRS, Inst Sci & Evolut, Dept Genet Environm,CC065, F-34095 Montpellier, France","Simkova, A (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic.",simkova@sci.muni.cz,"Morand, Serge/M-5433-2018; Simkova, Andrea/F-7636-2019","Morand, Serge/0000-0003-3986-7659; Simkova, Andrea/0000-0002-5995-6766","Masaryk University; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic;  [MSM 0021 622 416.]","This study was funded by the Research Project of the Masaryk University, Brno, Project No.: MSM 0021 622 416.

In this study, however, we used a multi-species competition experiment with six annuals to measure relative competitive ability in terms of reproductive output, i.e. the number of offspring produced for the next generation. Under greenhouse conditions, plants of each species were started in pots from germinating seeds and were grown singly (free of competition) and at high density in both monocultures and in mixtures with all study species. Several traits traditionally regarded as determinants of competitive ability in plants were recorded for each species grown singly, including: seed mass, germination time, early growth rate and potential plant size (biomass and height). Under competition, several traits were recorded as indicators of relative performance in both monocultures and mixtures, including: biomass of survivors, total number of survivors, number of reproductive survivors, and reproductive output (total seed production) of the survivors. As expected, species that grew to a larger biomass in isolation had higher seed production in isolation. However, none of the traditional plant growth/size-related traits, measured either in isolation or under competition, could predict between species variation in reproductive output under competition in either monocultures or mixtures. In mixtures, 97% of this variation in reproductive output could be explained by between-species variation in the number of reproductive survivors. The results indicate that traits measured on plants grown singly may be poor predictors of reproductive output under competition, and that species' rank order of competitive ability in terms of the biomass of survivors may bear no relationship to their rank order in terms of the number of offspring produced by these survivors. This has important implications for the interpretation of mechanisms of species coexistence and community assembly within vegetation.","[Neytcheva, Marina S.; Aarssen, Lonnie W.] Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada","Neytcheva, MS (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Dept Biol, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",aarssenl@biology.queensu.ca,"Aarssen, Lonnie W./K-5778-2012",,,,,59,23,23,3,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,SEP,2008,117,9,,,,,1298,1307,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16695.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,337BJ,WOS:000258410200003,,,,,2021-09-21,

This kind of indirect effects has received little attention to date, although recent research suggest they may not be infrequent. Chytridiomycosis is an EID that is affecting amphibian assemblages worldwide. Here we present the first (to our knowledge) field evidence of its indirect effect on assemblage structure through the disruption of a biotic interaction. We have documented an expansion of the common toad (Bufo bufo) after chytridiomycosis nearly extirpated the midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) in Penalara Natural Park (Central Spain). Bufo bufo has significantly increased its number of breeding sites. All newly occupied breeding ponds were colonized once the large numbers of large, overwintering A. obstetricans tadpoles they had previously held disappeared. An experiment demonstrated that breeding B. bufo adults strongly avoided laying eggs in water containing A. obstetricans tadpoles, accounting for observed patterns of pond use. A second experiment failed to show any predation by large A. obstetricans tadpoles on B. bufo eggs, but other researchers have documented reductions in condition, growth and survival of B. bufo larvae caused by the presence of A. obstetricans tadpoles. In Penalara, chytridiomycosis attacks B. bufo too, but its effect on it has been quite less severe than on A. obstetricans. Our findings show how, besides any chytridiomycosis direct effects, interspecific differences in its impact may alter assemblage-influencing biotic interactions and, hence, assemblage structure in indirect ways.","[Bosch, Jaime; Rincon, Pedro A.] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Bosch, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",bosch@mncn.csic.es,"Bosch, Jaime/H-3042-2011","Bosch, Jaime/0000-0002-0099-7934",,,,55,24,25,3,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

We examined the response of several dominant and subordinate cavity-nesting species to a reduction in the availability of an essential resource (nesting cavities) using the novel experimental approach of blocking the entrances to high-quality cavities. We monitored nest abundance on seven treatment and 13 control sites (aspen groves in a grassland matrix) in British Columbia, Canada, for two years pretreatment (2000-2001), two years during treatment (2002-2003), and two years posttreatment (cavities reopened; 2004-2005). At the community level, nest abundance declined by 50% on treatment sites following cavity blocking and returned to pretreatment levels following cavity reopening. Nest abundance of European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), a dominant secondary cavity-nester (SCN), declined by 89% and failed to recover posttreatment. Conversely, nest abundance of Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides; a subordinate SCN) increased following cavity blocking and remained high following reopening. Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) were unaffected by cavity blocking. We suggest that starlings, while being the dominant SCN, may be limited by availability of suitable nest sites, whereas bluebirds may be limited by starling abundance. We propose that plasticity in nest site preferences of subordinate cavity-nesters may enable them to contend with natural variation in availability of critical resources, such as nest cavities and food, in addition to coping with interspecific competition. This is the. first community-level, multiyear study involving manipulation of nest site availability via experimental cavity blocking.","[Aitken, Kathryn E.

Here, we studied interspecific variation in vocal mimicry in a comparative study of 241 European songbirds. We tested whether vocal mimicry is a mode of repertoire acquisition or whether it resulted from imperfect song learning. We also investigated the effect of the degree of contact with the vocal environment (with species having larger ranges, abundance, or being long lived having a higher degree of mimicry) and a possible link with cognitive capacity (an overall larger brain in species with mimicry). Finally, we determined the potential evolutionary role of vocal mimicry in different interspecific contexts, predicting that mimicry may affect the intensity of brood parasitism, predation, or degree of hybridization. While controlling for research effort and phylogenetic relationships among taxa, we found that effect sizes for intersong interval, brain size, breeding dispersal, abundance, age-dependent expression of repertoires, and predation risk reached a level that may indicate evolutionary importance. Vocal mimicry seems to be a consequence of song continuity rather than song complexity, may partially have some cognitive component but may also be dependent on the vocal environment, and may attract the attention of predators. However, estimates of sexual selection and interspecific contacts due to brood parasitism and hybridization varied independently of vocal mimicry. Therefore, mimicry may have no function in female choice for complex songs and may be weakly selected via interspecific associations. These findings provide little evidence for vocal mimicry having evolved to serve important functions in most birds.","Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; CSIC, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, Dept Funct & Evolut Ecol, Almeria, Spain; Univ Paris 06, Lab Parasitol Evolut, Paris, France","Garamszegi, LZ (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Campus Drie Eiken, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",laszlo.garamszegi@ua.ac.be,"Eens, Marcel/AAC-8466-2020; Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015; Aviles, Jesus/K-3332-2014; Garamszegi, Laszlo Z/B-5089-2011; Moller, Anders/O-6665-2016","Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183; Aviles, Jesus/0000-0002-1463-8393; Moller, Anders/0000-0003-3739-4675",,,,68,25,26,0,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Moreover, aggregations of aposernatic species, and morphologically similar beetles such as Anchomenus dorsalis and Brachinus sclopeta are even rarer. Most interestingly, in these aggregations, we observed a peculiar rubbing behaviour of A. dorsalis towards B. sclopeta. In this study we aimed (i) to verify if A. dorsalis displays the rubbing behaviour towards non-aposematic species, (ii) to describe in detail and to quantify this behaviour between A. dorsalis and B. sclopeta, and (iii) to verify if previous experience of inter-specific gregariousness with the same species may exert some effects on the frequency of the rubbing display. We have investigated the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of rubbing behaviour towards aposematic and non-aposematic carabide beetle species, and then we used A. dorsalis and B. sclopeta as model species. We tested the rubbing of A. dorsalis towards B. sclopeta with either solitary A. dorsalis or in A. dorsalis coming from monospecific (A. dorsalis) or from heterospecific (A. dorsalis and B. sclopeta) aggregations. We finally tested the effectiveness of the B. sclopeta cuticular odour in eliciting rubbing from A. dorsalis by presenting olfactory dummies (special paper) either soaked with water or after it had previously been placed in a monospecific group of B. sclopeta for 15 days. First of all, we found important differences in the occurrence of rubbing behaviour towards aposematic and non-aposematic species, as A. dorsalis displayed the rubbing only towards the former. Secondly, rubbing frequency depended on the pre-test conditions (isolated, mono- or heterospecific aggregations) of the tested A. dorsalis individuals, as no rubbing occur-red in individuals coming from heterospecific aggregations. The paper presentation tests demonstrated that the odour of B. sclopeta was sufficient to provoke rubbing in A. dorsalis. We conclude that aggregation in these species of carabid beetles may influence their anti-predatory defences possibly increasing the effectiveness of the aposematic (warning) signals. More work is needed to delineate in detail the evolutionary significance of this behaviour, focusing on the possibility that interspecific aggregations may not be so rare in ground beetles, and that this positive interaction could involve a larger number of species and genera, at least in wet, sun-exposed and open land habitat types.","Univ Calabria, Dipartimento Ecol, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; Univ Florence, Dipartimento Biol Anim & Genet, I-50125 Florence, Italy","Brandmayr, TZ (corresponding author), Univ Calabria, Dipartimento Ecol, Via P Bucci, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",tuzetto@unical.it,"Bonacci, Teresa/ABB-1329-2020; Brandmayr, Pietro/B-3022-2014; Massolo, Alessandro/AAO-5344-2021","Brandmayr, Pietro/0000-0002-6753-4897; Massolo, Alessandro/0000-0002-6333-4281",,,,49,13,14,0,26,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0394-9370,1828-7131,,ETHOL ECOL EVOL,Ethol.

While small-scale individual-level studies on normative-native fish interactions have helped elucidate mechanisms of impact, very few investigations have occurred at a scale consistent with that of species replacement. Thus, large-scale population-level studies are needed to understand the effects of normative fish as well as to more effectively conserve native fishes in the presence of normative fish. For this reason, we conducted an evaluation of the effects of normative brown trout Salmo trutta on the individual- and population-level performance of native cutthroat trout using a field-experimental approach. We studied local populations of cutthroat trout in the presence and absence of brown trout in long stream reaches and subsequently compared growth, condition, stable-isotope-based measures of dietary habits, movement, and survival between treatment groups. We found clear evidence for reduced cutthroat trout growth owing to the presence of brown trout. Additionally, we observed differences in cutthroat trout dietary habits based on delta C-13 signatures resulting from our experimental manipulation of brown trout abundance. Finally, brown trout suppressed cutthroat trout movement but had no apparent effect on their survival. Considering previous studies, we concluded that the individual-level effects of brown trout on cutthroat trout are scale invariant. Higher-level impacts (i.e., on movement and survival), in contrast, appear to be more sensitive to the scale at which the investigation is conducted. Overall, our results indicate that brown trout can have strong negative effects on cutthroat trout performance and should therefore be more explicitly considered in native fish conservation plans.","Utah State Univ, US Geol Survey, Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Aquat Watershed & Earth Resources,Coll Nat, Logan, UT 84322 USA","McHugh, P (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, US Geol Survey, Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Dept Aquat Watershed & Earth Resources,Coll Nat, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",pam@cc.usu.edu,"Budy, Phaedra/B-2415-2012","Budy, Phaedra/0000-0002-9918-1678",,,,88,35,37,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-8487,1548-8659,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

Treatments included four areas of weed control around individual trees (0.375, 1.49, 3.35, and 5.95 m(2)), no weed control (check), total vegetation control, control of herbaceous competition only, or control of woody competition only. Douglas-fir growth and woody-species invasion differed between the Coast Range site (Summit) and the Cascade Range foothills site (Marcola). Woody species reinvasion was more intense at Summit, with Douglas-fir cumulative mortality in the check treatment reaching 23% in year 12. Woody-only control improved Douglas-fir growth at Summit but had no significant effect on growth at Marcola. Total vegetation control had a profound effect on stem volume growth 12 years after planting. At Summit, total vegetation control resulted in a 355% increase in volume per hectare relative to the check. At Marcola the increase was only 63%. At Summit, growth increased with each increase in area of weed control, whereas at Marcola growth increased with increasing area of weed control up to 3.35 m(2) of control. Results suggest that much of the gain in volume growth attributable to weed control may be lost if weed-control treatments are not highly efficacious. The differential response to woody control indicates that its benefit at a given site is strongly related to the abundance of competitive hardwood species, which may be predicted from the preharvest stand structure and vegetation community.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Forest Capital Partners, Monmouth, OR 97361 USA","Rose, R (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Sci, 321 Richardson Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",robin.rose@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,30,37,37,0,6,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA-N R C RESEARCH PRESS,OTTAWA,"BUILDING M 55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

We assembled all possible food webs including one or more of the ciliate species and cross-classified them with four levels of enrichment of the bacterial medium. The qualitative outcome of food web interactions was independent of enrichment and always the same: Tetrahjrmena strongly depressed or excluded Colpidium, and Blepharisma strongly depressed or excluded both bacterivores. Consequently, in all sub-webs only the dominant ciliate species responded positively to enrichment. The total density of bacteria increased with enrichment irrespective of food web composition. In contrast, the response of singlecelled bacteria to enrichment depended on food web composition and was only weakly positive in most food webs with the omnivore. Enrichment had a positive effect on the relative success of (presumably more defended) bacterial aggregates. The outcome of interspecific interactions among ciliates could not be predicted from monoculture experiments and deviated from earlier experiments in which each bacterivore coexisted separately with the omnivore. As a potential explanation we suggest that changes in experimental protocol reduced spatial heterogeneity and increased attack rates. A simple, dynamical model shows that increased attack rates can indeed greatly decrease the upper limit and range of enrichment over which intermediate consumers can coexist with omnivores.","Uppsala Univ, Dept Limnol, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; Univ Munich, Dept Biol 2, DE-82152 Martinsried, Germany","Liess, A (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Limnol, Norbyvagen 20, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",antonia.liess@ebc.uu.se,"Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013; Liess, Antonia/H-6789-2016","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; Liess, Antonia/0000-0003-1556-3861",,,,53,15,15,1,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2006,114,1,,,,,15,26,,10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14516.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,070YP,WOS:000239563300003,,,,,2021-09-21,

One of these, B biotype, has proven to be particularly adapted to invading new areas, but the underlying reasons as to why it has a well-developed capacity to invade is not known. To develop an understanding of factors that may be contributing to B's invasive capacity, inter-biotype mating interactions and host plant suitability for the exotic B (B. tabaci Mediterranean/Asia Minor/Africa) and the indigenous Australian (AN) biotype (B. tabaci Australia) were examined. The results suggest that when confined to a mutually acceptable host, B cannot establish when the ratio of AN : B exceeds 20 : 1. However, when simultaneously provided with a host that only it prefers, B is able to establish even at 50 : 1 (AN : B). Further, when both biotypes occur together the number of progeny per female increases (relative to the number produced when only one biotype is present). The response is observed for both biotypes, but is considerably greater in the case of B. In addition, B performs better in the presence of the AN biotype B. tabaci Australia while AN perform worse in coexistence with B, but only if the demographics allow B to mate without significant interference. This leads to the prediction that B will invade in circumstances where its unique hosts are of sufficient number to escape the full negative impact of inter-biotype mating interactions and reduced competitiveness in terms of reproductive rate, while exposing the indigenous biotype to the full effects of the interaction.","CSIRO, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia","De Barro, PJ (corresponding author), CSIRO, 120 Meiers Rd, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia.",paul.debarro@csiro.au,"De Barro, Paul J/C-1724-2008",,,,,31,51,53,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Although the two species have similar diets, the jackal is about three times larger than the red fox. The current evidence for interspecific competition between these two canids is circumstantial and indirect. In this study we aimed to measure experimentally the response of red foxes to increasing exposure to the presence of the golden jackal. Our field experiments comprised three stimuli: urine as a scent stimulus, a mounted specimen and urine as a static animal-image stimulus, and a caged pet animal as a live animal stimulus. The treatment and control were placed near food trays, and the behaviour of foxes around these trays was documented by video recorders. In most cases, the presence of scent or cast of a golden jackal did not alter the behaviour of the foxes. However, foxes avoided the test arena when a live jackal was present. This finding provides strong evidence that red foxes fear jackals, and shows that foxes are more concerned when a live jackal is present. The possible implications of the observed fox behaviour for the understanding of large-scale competitive exclusion among canid species are discussed.

The nest site limitation hypothesis postulates that nesting opportunities are more limited for weak excavators, which consequently invest more in each breeding attempt by laying larger clutches. Alternatively, clutch size may be determined by diet; the clutch sizes of strong excavators may be smaller because they are able to specialize on a more seasonally stable prey. We built a conceptual model that integrated hypotheses for interspecific variation in clutch size and tested it with comparative data on life- history traits of woodpeckers ( Picidae) and nuthatches ( Sittidae). In most analyses, diet explained more variation in clutch size among species than did propensity to excavate. Migratory status was positively associated with clutch size but was difficult to distinguish from diet since resident species consumed more bark beetles ( a prey available in winter) and had smaller clutches than migratory species. The literature suggests that cavities are not limited in natural, old- growth forests. Although our data do not rule out nest site limitation, we conclude that annual stability of food resources has a larger impact on the evolution of clutch sizes in excavators than does limitation of nest sites.","Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada; Univ Calif Berkeley, Hastings Reservat & Museum Vertebrate Zool, Carmel Valley, CA 93924 USA; Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Wiebe, KL (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, 112 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada.",karen.wiebe@usask.ca; koenigwd@berkeley.edu; kmartin@interchange.ubc.ca,"Koenig, Walter D/A-5509-2009","Koenig, Walter/0000-0001-6207-1427",,,,89,30,32,2,28,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Recent studies have demonstrated considerable interspecific variation in the intensity of threat-sensitive response patterns, ranging from strongly graded to relatively nongraded or hypersensitive threat-sensitive response patterns. Here, we test for intraspecific plasticity in threat-sensitive responses by varying group size. We exposed juvenile convict cichlids, Archocentrus nigrofasciatus (Gunther, 1867), as individuals or in small (groups of three) or large (groups of six) shoals to a series of dilutions of conspecific chemical alarm cues and a distilled water control. Singleton cichlids exhibited significant reductions in time spent moving and in frequency of foraging attempts (relative to distilled water controls) when exposed to a 12.5% dilution of conspecific alarm cue, with no difference in response intensity at higher stimulus concentrations, suggesting a nongraded (hypersensitive) response pattern. Small shoals exhibited a similar response pattern, but at a higher response threshold (25% dilution of stock alarm cue solution). Large shoals, however, exhibited a graded response pattern. These results suggest that group size influences the trade-off between predator avoidance and other fitness related activities, resulting in flexible threat-sensitive response patterns.","Concordia Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada","Brown, GE (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Biol, 7141 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada.",gbrown@alcor.concordia.ca,"Brown, Grant E/B-7182-2013","Brown, Grant E/0000-0003-3493-3477",,,,51,64,64,0,34,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0008-4301,,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

How do patterns of local habitat use change along an elevation gradient? How do patterns of local habitat partitioning interact with partitioning at a landscape scale? Location Northern and southern Lesser Antilles islands, West Indies. Methods We document how Anolis Daudin, 1802 lizards partition habitat locally at sites along a landscape-scale elevation gradient. We examine habitat partitioning both with and without interspecific interactions in the predominately flat northern Lesser Antilles islands and in the more mountainous southern islands. Results Anoles partition local habitat along perch-height and microclimate axes. Northern-group sympatric anoles partition local habitat by perch height and have overlapping distributions at the landscape scale. Southern-group sympatric anoles partition local habitat by microclimate and specialize in particular habitats at the landscape scale. In both the northern and southern groups, species use different perch heights and microclimates only in areas of species overlap along the elevation gradient. Main conclusions We demonstrate the interaction between local- and landscape-scale habitat partitioning. In the case of microclimate partitioning, the interaction results from the use of thermal physiology to partition habitat at multiple scales. This interaction prompts the question of whether habitat partitioning developed 'local-out' or 'landscape-in'. We pose this dichotomy and present a framework for its resolution.","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Buckley, LB (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 371 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",lbuckley@stanford.edu,,,,,,36,15,18,0,20,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

We used stochastic two species, circular three patch dynamic models to investigate the patterns of invasion and impacts upon the affected species. Both persistent and degradable toxicants were incorporated as parts of the model system to act as disturbance regimens. There is a clear series of patterns that result from these simulations. Competition increases population variability, but decreases the number of distinct outcomes possible from the same initial conditions. Isolation of the patch of the introduction was the main determinant of successful establishment through a process we call the beachhead effect. Coexistence of species was often possible in local patches, contrary to the analytical solutions of Lotka-Volterra equations and numerous modeling studies. Contaminants and their resultant disturbances are important as contributors to the stochastic nature of models. The stochasticity leads to a variety of outcomes from some sets of initial conditions. Different outcomes have different probabilities of occurrence and are dependent upon the specific initial conditions of the simulation. A clear pattern that is apparent is the beachhead effect, where the invasive establishes a population within a relatively remote patch before migrating to the remainder of the landscape. We make predictions and provide specific research hypotheses as to the causes and effects of invasive species establishment, spread, and impacts.","Western Washington Univ, Huxley Coll Environm, Inst Environm Toxicol & Chem, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; Western Washington Univ, Huxley Coll Environm, Inst Environm Toxicol, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA","Landis, WG (corresponding author), Western Washington Univ, Huxley Coll Environm, Inst Environm Toxicol & Chem, 516,High St,ES518,MS9180, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA.",landis@cc.wwu.edu,,"Landis, Wayne/0000-0001-9468-3532",,,,41,5,7,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0272-4332,1539-6924,,RISK ANAL,Risk Anal.,DEC,2005,25,6,,,,,1637,1651,,10.1111/j.1539-6924.2005.00680.x,,,15,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences",996YF,WOS:000234211500023,16506989,,,,2021-09-21,

Here we dissect their contributions to community stability in a model herbivore-natural enemy interaction consisting of two aphid species (Acyrthosiphon pisum and Megoura viciae) and a specialist parasitoid (Aphidius ervi) that attacks only one of the aphids (A. pisum). In replicated cage experiments, we found that the two aphid species alone were unable to coexist, with A. pisunt competitively excluding M. viciae. We also found that the simple host-parasitoid interaction between A. pisum and the parasitoid was unstable. However, the three-species community persisted for at least 50 weeks. We constructed a series of models to explain the stability of the full community and conclude that it is due to a combination of density-mediated and trait-mediated indirect interactions. Parasitoid attack on the susceptible host reduces the interspecific competition experienced by the non-host (a density-mediated effect), and the presence of the non-host reduces the searching efficiency of the parasitoid (a trait-mediated effect).","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","van Veen, FJF (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",f.vanveen@imperial.ac.uk,"van Veen, Franciscus JF/H-2101-2013","van Veen, Frank/0000-0003-0708-5492",,,,44,50,51,0,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2005,86,12,,,,,3182,3189,,10.1890/04-1590,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,994YI,WOS:000234066700006,,,,,2021-09-21,

A generic relationship describing the response of assimilation rate to temperature and light using SLA and leaf nitrogen content as conversion factors successfully predicted inter-specific differences in assimilation rates in the field. This relationship could be incorporated into weed-crop competition models to predict the productivity and competitive impact of weed mixtures, including species outside the current data set. Assimilation rates at light saturation in the field were determined largely by SLA.

We recently showed that P. mulleri infection was associated with G. d. celticus hosts being more vulnerable to predation by the invasive amphipod Gammarus pulex. Parasitized G. d. celticus also had a reduced ability to prey upon other co-occurring amphipods. We suggested the parasite may have pervasive influences on host ecology and behaviour. Here, we examine the association between P. mulleri parasitism and parameters influencing individual host fitness, behaviour and interspecific interactions. We also investigate the relationship between parasite prevalence and host population structure in the field. In our G. d. celticus study population, P. mulleri prevalence was strongly seasonal, ranging from 8.5% in summer to 44.9% in winter. The relative abundance of hosts with the heaviest parasite burden increased during summer, which coincided with high host mortality, suggesting that parasitism may regulate host abundance to some degree. Females were more likely to be parasitized than males and parasitized males were paired with smaller females than unparasitized males. Parasitism was associated with reduction in the host's activity level and reduced both its predation on the isopod Asellus aquaticus and aggression towards precopula pairs of the invasive G. pulex.

In gregarious species, larvae tolerate each other and several individuals can develop from a single host. We report experiments on two congeneric braconid species aimed at understanding how gregarious development evolved in one genus, and the consequences of larval interactions for parental behavior. In the transition from solitary to gregarious development, one possible intermediate stage is if solitary species frequently lay more than one egg per host. If the risk of conspecific superparasitism (another female of the same species oviposits into a single host) is high, optimal clutch size theory predicts the laying of multiple-egg clutches, because a female will increase the probability of the surviving larva being her own. Under the same conditions, theory predicts that gregarious species should reduce their clutch size. In our experiments, the solitary Aphaereta genevensis increased their clutch size under the risk of intraspecific competition for hosts whilst the gregarious A. pallipes reduced their clutch size, as predicted. In A. genevensis, the response to the risk of competition was dependent upon body size, being greatest amongst small females. In A. pallipes, the response did not depend on female body size, but clutch size increased with body size in all treatments, unlike in A. genevensis. Under the risk of competition from the other species, the response differed relative to the intraspecific treatments and differed between species. Thus, our data suggest that: (1) competition for hosts may have contributed to the evolution of gregarious development in this genus; (2) female wasps can combine information from both external and internal cues in complex ways during clutch size adjustment; and (3) the social environment may alter the adaptive response to both external and internal cues in adult females.","Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England","Mayhew, PJ (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Biol, POB 373, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England.",pjm19@york.ac.uk,"Mayhew, Peter J/I-6363-2012; Mayhew, Peter/B-1370-2008","Mayhew, Peter J/0000-0002-7346-6560; ",,,,71,26,28,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Resource partitioning has been suggested as an important driving force in the radiation of the surfperch family, Within the family, two congeneric sister species, Embiotoca jacksoni and E. lateralis, are known to compete strongly for a preferred single food resource and may be used as a model of ecological interactions for the family. Along the California coast, the distribution of the two species differs. Embiotoca jacksoni has a continuous range, whereas E. lateralis shows a disjunction with a distribution gap in the Southern California Bight. Two hypotheses may explain this disjunct distribution. Ecological competition may have displaced E. lateralis in favor of E. jacksoni. Alternatively, a common vicariant event may have separated the species into northern and southern populations, followed by secondary contact in E. jacksoni but not in E. lateralis. The two hypotheses predict different phylogeographic and demographic signatures. Using a combined phylogeographic and coalescent approach based on mitochondrial control region data, we show that vicariance can only account for a portion of the observed divergences. Our results are compatible with a significant role played by ecological competition in the southern range of the species.","Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","Bernardi, G (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 100 Shaffer Rd, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",bernardi@biology.ucsc.edu,"Bernardi, Giacomo/F-6346-2011","Bernardi, Giacomo/0000-0002-8249-4678",,,,66,34,36,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,FEB,2005,59,2,,,,,386,394,,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2005.tb00997.x,,,9,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,904AZ,WOS:000227468700012,15807423,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

We conducted a laboratory study to determine whether temperature influenced the effects exerted by large rainbow trout on the growth of Atlantic salmon parr. Bioenergetic models were used to predict maintenance rations so that food resources were limiting over a range of temperatures; equal biomasses of rainbow trout were substituted for Atlantic salmon to evaluate the relative effect of interspecific interactions on Atlantic salmon growth. In the presence of rainbow trout, salmon growth increased as temperatures increased from 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C; no such temperature effect occurred for salmon maintained alone. Growth differences between salmon maintained with and without trout were highly significant at 25 degrees C but not at 15 degrees C. We conclude that the presence of trout depressed salmon growth at 15 degrees C but not at higher temperatures, most likely a result of differences in thermal optima between these two species. Field data show that the proportion of stocked Atlantic salmon to wild rainbow trout coexisting in natural streams is a function of mean summer temperature. As stream temperatures increased, Atlantic salmon became increasingly favored over rainbow trout, but with a concomitant decrease in total salmonine biomass. We suggest that Atlantic salmon restoration programs focus more attention on relatively warm streams in watersheds where interactions with naturalized rainbow trout may occur.","SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Fac Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA","Coghlan, SM (corresponding author), Arkansas State Univ, Dept Chem & Phys, State Univ, AR 72467 USA.",scoghlan@astate.edu,,,,,,49,19,19,1,12,INT ASSOC GREAT LAKES RES,ANN ARBOR,"2205 COMMONWEALTH BLVD, ANN ARBOR, MI 48105 USA",0380-1330,,,J GREAT LAKES RES,J.

Here, we investigate the growth and life-span of 5 small species of coral reef goby (family Gobiidae): Istigobius goldmanni, Asterropteryx semipunctatus, Amblygobius bynoensis, Amblygobius phalaena and Valenciennea muralis. All 5 species were relatively short-lived, with the oldest individual sampled ranging from 11 to 16 mo depending on species and sex. Rapid growth occurred over much of the size range of all 5 species and, in contrast to most reef fishes, relatively little or no time was spent at an asymptotic size. Patterns of growth were best described by a Broken Stick model for L goldmanni, and by either a Broken Stick modi l or the von Bertalanffy growth function for the other 4 species. Summer-growing individuals had higher growth rates than winter-growing individuals, but this did not affect the overall patterns of growth. Sex-specific differences in growth were evident for L goldmanni and A. semipunctatus, with males growing faster and attaining a larger maximum size than females. In contrast, there was no significant difference in growth between male and female A. bynoensis, A. phalaena and V muralis. This pattern may be related to interspecific differences in intensity of sexual selection, mating system, and reproductive behaviour. Overall, the patterns of growth and life-span of these 5 small species conformed to traditional concepts of life-history theory.","Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; Univ Otago, Dept Marine Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Hernaman, V (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",vhernaman@xtra.co.nz,"Munday, Philip L/F-5443-2011","Munday, Philip L/0000-0001-9725-2498",,,,72,33,34,1,20,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The emphasis is on process rather than pattern. Phylogeographic studies in some groups, such as the agarics, demonstrate predominantly allopatric speciation, often through vicariance, as seen in many plants and animals. The variety of life history factors in fungi suggests, however, a diversity in speciation mechanisms that is borne out in comparison of some key examples. Life history features in fungi with a bearing on speciation include genetic mechanisms for intra- and interspecies interactions, haploidy as monokaryons, dikaryons, or coenocytes, distinctive types of propagules with distinctive modes of dispersal, as well as characteristic relationships to the substrate or host as specialized or generalist saprotrophs, parasites or mutualists with associated opportunities and selective pressures for hybridization. Approaches are proposed for both retrospective, phylogeographic determination of speciation mechanisms, and experimental studies with the potential for genomic applications, particularly in examining the relationship between adaptation and reproductive isolation.","Univ Toronto, Dept Bot, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada","Kohn, LM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Bot, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",kohn@utm.utoronto.ca,,,,,,115,133,144,1,42,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4286,1545-2107,,ANNU REV PHYTOPATHOL,Annu.

We describe the demographic responses of both biomass and numbers of adult fish, predicting the mean and the variance of temporal fluctuations resulting from stochastic recruitment of juveniles. We find that top-down control acts by suppressing variability of numbers of fish, which in turn suppresses the variability of biomass. Bottom-up control has no effect on fluctuations of numbers of fish, though it strongly reduces fluctuations of biomass. Because fecundity of fish is directly linked to body mass, the regulation of biomass tightly regulates reproductive output independently of the number of individuals in the population. Finally, populations under pelagic control experience bounded fluctuations of biomass and numbers directly proportional to the bounded fluctuations of recruitment. The demographic signatures predicted from both bottom-up and pelagic control are consistent with current evidence supporting the recruitment limitation hypothesis in reef fish ecology. We propose tests to discriminate the dominant mode of density-dependent regulation using qualitative trends in time series demographic data across environmental clines.","Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Sandin, SA (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ssandin@ucsd.edu; pacala@princeton.edu,,,,,,58,19,19,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Recent efforts to understand how the patterning of interaction strength affects both structure and dynamics in food webs have highlighted several obstacles to productive synthesis. Issues arise with respect to goals and driving questions, methods and approaches, and placing results in the context of broader ecological theory. 2. Much confusion stems from lack of clarity about whether the questions posed relate to community-level patterns or to species dynamics, and to what authors actually mean by the term 'interaction strength'. Here, we describe the various ways in which this term has been applied and discuss the implications of loose terminology and definition for the development of this field. 3. Of particular concern is the clear gap between theoretical and empirical investigations of interaction strengths and food web dynamics. The ecological community urgently needs to explore new ways to estimate biologically reasonable model coefficients from empirical data, such as foraging rates, body size, metabolic rate, biomass distribution and other species traits. 4. Combining numerical and analytical modelling approaches should allow exploration of the conditions under which different interaction strengths metrics are interchangeable with regard to relative magnitude, system responses, and species identity. 5. Finally, the prime focus on predator-prey links in much of the research to date on interaction strengths in food webs has meant that the potential significance of non-trophic interactions, such as competition, facilitation and biotic disturbance, has been largely ignored by the food web community. Such interactions may be important dynamically and should be routinely included in future food web research programmes.","Univ Calif, White Mt Res Stn, Bishop, CA 93514 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Utrecht, Dept Environm Sci, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; Rockefeller Univ, New York, NY 10021 USA; Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10021 USA; Linkoping Univ, Dept Biol, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; Univ Coll Cork, Dept Zool Ecol & Plant Sci, Cork, Ireland; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, NERC, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Univ London, Royal Holloway & Bedford New Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; Univ London, Queen Mary, Sch Biol Sci, London E1 4NS, England; Univ Aegean, Dept Marine Sci, Mitilini 81100, Lesvos Isl, Greece; IFARAN, Lab Math Ecol, Moscow 119017, Russia; Univ Manchester, Dept Theoret Phys, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; IMIM UPF GRIB, Complex Syst Lab, Barcelona, Spain; Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Berlow, EL (corresponding author), Univ Calif, White Mt Res Stn, Bishop, CA 93514 USA.",eric@wmrs.edu; cohen@rockefeller.edu; gkok@aegean.gr,"Montoya, Jose/AAH-2369-2019; Jansen, Vincent A A/C-8353-2009; Montoya, Jose M/E-3605-2010; Petchey, Owen/D-8851-2011; Kokkoris, Giorgos D/A-1222-2010","Petchey, Owen/0000-0002-7724-1633; Montoya, Jose M./0000-0002-6676-7592; Logofet, Dmitrii/0000-0001-5229-6534; Jones, John Iwan/0000-0002-7238-2509; Kokkoris, Georgios/0000-0002-9342-6566; Jansen, Vincent A.A./0000-0002-6518-2090",,,,189,371,381,4,225,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

On Prosecco, densities of Amblyseius andersoni, and to a lesser extent of Typhlodromus pyri increased when downy mildew symptoms occurred on a high number of leaves. On Pinot, A. andersoni was the dominant species and its densities markedly increased when downy mildew spread. A. andersoni populations were significantly larger on leaves with downy mildew symptoms than on leaves without symptoms and their densities were positively correlated to the extent of leaf surface showing symptoms. The effect of downy mildew on T pyri populations was less marked. There were no relationships between downy mildew spread and spider mite abundance (Panonychus ulmi). Untreated plots or plots treated with folpet to control downy mildew were monitored in an experimental vineyard colonized by A. andersoni. A. andersoni populations increased when downy mildew symptoms spread and their densities were significantly higher in the control than on folpet plots. In another experimental vineyard, T pyri densities were significantly higher in the control (severely infected by downy mildew) than on copper hydroxide plots. Isoelectric focusing electrophoresis (IEF) was employed to detect downy mildew in mites and glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) was selected from among different enzymes. A stain corresponding to downy mildew in addition to the phytoseiid intrinsic stains was detected in a high proportion of A. andersoni and T pyri collected from infected leaves. Downy mildew stains were not detected in P. ulmi females collected from infected leaves. Most A. andersoni and T pyri females confined on symptomatic leaves became positive to IEF a few hours later.

In three different years, we found evidence for a metacommunity structure. We also found that spatial and environmental components act independently of each other due to the small Geographic area and the high dispersal rates in this system. Despite these homogenizing forces. local environmental variables (associated with alternative equilibria in shallow lakes) were strongly related with zooplankton community structure in the studied years.

Territories of Ortolan Buntings were in areas with lower vegetation density than those of Yellowhammers, and as a consequence they tended to be in areas with shorter trees and further from farmland than Yellowhammers. A previous study in the same area found that Ortolan Buntings used farmland up to 2.7 km from their territories for foraging, and here we report that Yellowhammers also used farmland outside territories. Overall, Yellowhammers settled in areas with denser vegetation, which were closer to attractive farmland feeding areas, than Ortolan Buntings. The differences in habitat choice did not result from competitive exclusion of the migratory Ortolan Buntings by the resident and heavier Yellowhammers close to farmland, for (1) interspecific territory overlap was larger than intraspecific overlap, (2) few observations of interspecific aggression were made, and (3) playback of song elicited no interspecific responses. Thus, settlement of Ortolan Buntings was not restricted by Yellowhammers, and their differences in habitat were apparently due to different preferences. The observation that both species obtained food outside territories in another habitat argues against food resource partitioning being the cause of differences in nesting habitat. Instead, we argue that nest site partitioning may play a role in nesting habitat segregation between these sympatric species.","Agr Univ Norway, Dept Biol & Nat Conservat, N-1432 As, Norway; Ecole Natl Super Agron Montpellier, F-34060 Montpellier, France","Dale, S (corresponding author), Agr Univ Norway, Dept Biol & Nat Conservat, POB 5014, N-1432 As, Norway.",svein.dale@ibn.nlh.no,,,,,,39,17,20,1,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2193-7192,2193-7206,,J ORNITHOL,J.

We used seminatural stream channels, landscaped to provide a range of depths, to test whether the factors influencing the formation of social hierarchies are similar in single- and mixed-species groups of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, and brown trout, Salmo trutta. We also tested whether these species have similar feeding rhythms during the day and whether dominant and subordinate individuals feed at different times, under both allopatric and sympatric conditions. Size, appeared to be a good predictor of feeding success of both species in allopatry, but not when they were in direct competition. In contrast, rate of aggression was positively correlated with feeding success in both allopatry and sympatry. However, the timing and rate of feeding of dominants and subordinates differed significantly only in the allopatric trials, with subordinate individuals in the sympatric trials being able to adopt a nonaggressive alternative strategy and continue feeding. These results highlight the behavioural plasticity of juvenile salmonids, which can adapt their feeding behaviour to the social environment, and suggest that the presence of another species with similar, but not identical, ecological requirements may increase the opportunity for the expression of alternative behavioural strategies.

The transmission of PAR through the plant canopies was measured using a line quantum sensor under six plant density treatments at the time of maximum canopy development each year. Four measures of plant abundance (planting density, actual density, projected leaf area index, and crown cover) were evaluated for their ability to predict PAR transmission through the plant canopies. Visual estimates of crown cover provided the best models each year. Vertical profiles of PAR transmission were used to compare the canopy structure among plant species and were used to refine the models. During the second growing season, increasing crown cover of bluejoint grass and large-leaved aster had the largest influence on PAR. In the third season, green alder, upland willow, and white birch (along with bluejoint grass and fireweed at the jack pine crown level) had the greatest influence on PAR. PAR measurements taken from a nearby forest for several of the plant species indicate that the models developed from our controlled experiment are reasonably applicable to naturally occurring plant populations.","Univ Maine, Dept Forest Ecosyst Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA; Ridgetown Coll, Agron Bldg, Ridgetown, ON N0P 2C0, Canada; Ontario Forest Res Inst, Sault St Marie, ON P6A 5N5, Canada; Univ Guelph, Dept Plant Agr, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","Wagner, RG (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Dept Forest Ecosyst Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",,,,,,,39,21,23,1,22,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0045-5067,,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

Using three scales of resolution, we examine the importance of a long-lived desert tree, iron-wood (Olneya tesota), in structuring plant communities and promoting biological diversity in the Sonoran Desert. We examined the positive effects of Olneya canopies of different sizes on plant communities in mesic and xeric habitats throughout the central Gulf Coast subregion of Sonora, Mexico. In xeric sites, Olneya canopies had strong positive effects on plant richness and abundance, and small positive effects on the size of plants, underscoring the role of facilitation in extreme environments. In mesic sites, Olneya canopies had very little effect on perennials and a negative effect on ephemeral richness, suggesting predominantly competitive effects in this less stressful environment. Overall, Olneya canopies increased biological diversity where abiotic stress was high, but did not increase diversity in more mesic areas. Thus Olneya canopies caused consistent shifts in plant-community structure among xeric and mesic sites, but not when these landscapes were combined. Benefactor size also mediated positive interactions, with larger Olneya canopies supporting larger perennials in both xeric and mesic sites. Thus stress gradients and benefactor size both influenced the balance of facilitative and competitive effects under nurse-plant canopies, and the spatial scale at which facilitative effects shape community structure.","US Forest Serv, USDA, Savannah River Inst, New Ellenton, SC 29809 USA; Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Tewksbury, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Box 118525, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jtewksbury@zoo.ufl.edu,,"Tewksbury, Joshua/0000-0002-9786-1477; Lloyd, John/0000-0002-9143-3789",,,,82,217,235,1,79,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2001,127,3,,,,,425,434,,10.1007/s004420000614,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,434ED,WOS:000168801400015,28547113,,,,2021-09-21,

The occupants benefit from favorable microhabitat, reduction in antiherbivore defense, and protection from natural enemies. The primary shelter maker has to spend energy and time and producing silk, but shelter users have great advantages without incurring costs. Shelter users consist of a wide range of arthropod taxa and can be divided into two groups: coexisting organisms that live with a primary shelter maker in the same shelter, and secondary users, which inhabit a leaf shelter after it is utilized by a shelter maker. Leaf shelters mediate interactions between (1) primary shelter makers and coexisting organisms or (2) primary shelter makers and secondary users, (3) secondary users, (4) shelter users and their natural enemies, and (5) primary shelter makers, secondary users, and their host plants. Most interactions between primary shelter makers and coexisting organisms constitute a direct trophic Linkage rather than indirect ones. There are actually unidirectional beneficial effects from a primary shelter maker to secondary shelter users, whereas leaf shelters mediate competition and predation among shelter users. By providing a leaf shelter, a shelter maker leads to increased diversity of interactions. Leaf shelters modify the distribution of organisms on the host plant and influence herbivory on the host plant. In tritrophic interactions, leaf shelters act as cues for natural enemies that search for a shelter user as prey. Furthermore, by enhancing habitat heterogeneity, leaf shelters affect the abundance and species richness of arthropods on host plants.","Univ Tokyo, Sch Agr & Life Sci, Lab Wildlife Biol, Tokyo, Japan","Fukui, A (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Hirano Cho, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",aki@fieldnote.com,,,,,,80,71,75,0,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

They represent four monophyletic groups regarded by some authorities as genera, but more traditionally as subgenera of the large genus Parus. To test the competition-based hypothesis that less closely related species are more likely to co-occur, we used specimens and observations obtained in October 1989 and May 1991 to delineate the morphology, elevational range, and habitat associations of each species in this rich assemblage. A morphometric cluster analysis did not support the assumption that phylogenetic similarity predicts morphological and hence ecological similarity. Up to five species commonly co-occurred in mixed flocks, as in Europe (where five subgenera are represented), but a randomization test showed that community assembly was random with respect to subgenus. On the other hand, for the entire data set (P = 0.05) and during spring (P = 0.07), species in the same morphometric cluster were less Likely to co-occur than were species with dissimilar morphology. It appears, therefore, that competition between species of similar morphology may play (or have played) some role in structuring assemblages of parids during the breeding season in this area. For this reason, more detailed studies of the parid assemblage in this area are recommended.","Coll Charleston, Dept Biol, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; Acad Nat Sci Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA; Ohio State Univ, Borror Lab Bioacoust, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Mccallum, DA (corresponding author), POB 51063, Eugene, OR 97405 USA.",,,,,,,54,5,5,0,5,WILSON ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC,ANN ARBOR,"MUSEUM OF ZOOLOGY UNIV MICHIGAN, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA",0043-5643,,,WILSON BULL,Wilson Bull.,MAR,2001,113,1,,,,,53,64,,10.1676/0043-5643(2001)113[0053:CAPOPA]2.0.CO;2,,,12,Ornithology,Zoology,455NC,WOS:000170032100007,,,,,2021-09-21,

But, despite the numerous studies on interspecific trophic interactions, few studies have evaluated their feeding strategy, especially by experimental approaches. In this study, we determined, in the absence of both intra and interspecific competitive interactions, the feeding preferences of the freshwater grass shrimp Palaemonetes antennarius for the most common potential resources in its habitat. Plant and animal items were offered as food to each adult shrimp in multiple-choice laboratory experiments. Resource selection was determined under conditions of low and high food availability and related to the shrimp body size. The role of microbial colonisation in favouring detritivory was also investigated. Results of these experiments showed that P. antennarius consumed only animal items, mostly preferring the isopod Proasellus coxalis. In addition, palatability of the unselected plant remains and non-living prey was not improved by the microbial enrichment. Shrimps also resorted to cannibalism at low ration. By contrast, at high ration they specialised on a narrower range of resources, directing more their feeding efforts towards isopods. The preference ranking of the selected food types was inversely related to the average mass of the prey and varied with the shrimp body size. In particular, the number of live isopods in the diet increased exponentially with the shrimp mass at food high ration, which resulted not to be limiting. In conclusion, food availability influences the food niche of P. antennarius whose feeding strategy in the laboratory is facultative specialisation on dead and live animals rather than omnivory. Ease of handling and/or capture seems to play a role in the food preference ranking.","Univ Rome, Dept Genet & Mol Biol, I-00185 Rome, Italy","Costantini, ML (corresponding author), Univ Rome, Dept Genet & Mol Biol, Via Sardi 70, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",marialetizia.costantini@uniroma1.it,,"Costantini, Maria Letizia/0000-0001-6242-558X; ROSSI, LORETO/0000-0001-8014-5397",,,,37,11,12,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JAN,2001,443,1-3,,,,,129,136,,10.1023/A:1017556406309,,,8,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,421LM,WOS:000168065900011,,,,,2021-09-21,

I compared Markov chain models of ecological communities to explore general processes leading to diversity differences of sessile species between coral reefs and rocky intertidal mussel beds. As predicted by diversity theory, high diversity coral reefs had lower species replacement probabilities and higher disturbance rates than did lower diversity mussel beds. Intransitivities in species replacements, recruitment limitation and responses to perturbing species from equilibrium (Jacobian elements) did not differ significantly between systems. Tradeoffs between the displacement risk or displacement ability of a species and either disturbance risk or colonising ability were not apparent. Manipulating the coral reef model to eliminate disturbance or intransitivities caused declines in species diversity, whereas removing recruitment limitation or increasing the probability of interspecific replacement did not. Higher overall disturbance levels can explain part of the diversity difference between systems, but much remained unexplained, indicating that details of the pattern and strengths of species interactions were probably extremely important.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Wootton, JT (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 1101 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",twootton@uchicago.edu,"Wootton, J.

Being basically non-evolutionary the MacArthur and Wilson's paradigm of island biogeography holds well in explaining processes that operate on the short ecological time, and proved to be helpful in explaining such issues as colonisation-extinction processes, species richness at equilibrium and species turnover. But several limitations make it insufficient as a modern tool for explaining evolutionary changes on islands. Colonising an island necessarily entails rapid evolutionary changes as a response to both non-selective and selective evolution. This results in a cascade of changes of life history traits, the so-called insular syndrome. Components of this syndrome include changes in morphology (size and shape), demography (age-specific fecundity, survival, dispersal) and behaviour. Shifts in behaviour are among the most spectacular features in insular vertebrates. Surprisingly few systematic and broad-scale analyses of demographic changes on islands have been designed to document the classical tenet of evolutionary shifts from high reproductive rates and short life span towards the opposite combination of life history traits as a result of high intraspecific competition in crowded insular populations. Examples of shifts in life history traits are given from a detailed case study on the biology of Blue tits in the island of Corsica, and most of these changes fit the predictions of an insular syndrome. An interesting trend resulting from shift from dispersal to sedentariness and habitat fidelity in islands is the potential far population differentiation at much smaller spatial scales than an mainland regions. This results in enhancing within-species diversity which counterbalances the species impoverishment of insular biotas. Although ecological adjustments and evolutionary changes make insular communities self-regulating assemblages of species that are resistant face to the risks of spontaneous extinction and invasion, insular communities are among the most vulnerable biota on Earth. The most important threats to island birds are discussed and some directions are given for promoting studies that could contribute to fill the most important gaps in our knowledge on evolution on islands and contribute to conservation issues.","CNRS, CEFE, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Blondel, J (corresponding author), CNRS, CEFE, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",,,,,,,152,100,103,2,72,OBSERVATOIRE OCEANOLOGIQUE BANYULS,BANYULS-SUR-MER CEDEX,"LABORATOIRE ARAGO, BP 44, 66651 BANYULS-SUR-MER CEDEX, FRANCE",0240-8759,,,VIE MILIEU,Vie Milieu,DEC,2000,50,4,,,,,205,220,,,,,16,Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,404EV,WOS:000167085200002,,,,,2021-09-21,

Morphological features (i.e. snout-vent length, SVL, mass and limb parameters), locomotor performance (sprint speed, climbing speed, manoeuvrability and endurance) and microhabitat use were measured in three lacertid lizard species. Additionally, microhabitat preference was tested in the laboratory with species kept apart and in combination with each other to assess mutual interference. 2, It was predicted that each species possesses morphological adaptations that allow it to excel in those performance measures relevant in its particular microhabitat. 3, The three species differed in microhabitat use. Lacerta bedriagae was mostly seen on boulders, while Podarcis sicula occurred among vegetation. Podarcis tiliguerta seemed more general in its microhabitat use. The results from the microhabitat preference in the laboratory corresponded well to these field observations. 4. Besides differing in SVL, the three species differed in limb length and diameter, and body mass tall relative to SVL). L. bedriagae has long forelimbs, short hindlimbs and a high body mass, while P. sicula has short forelimbs, long hindlimbs and a low body mass. P. tiliguerta is morphologically intermediate. 5. The differences found in morphology translated partially into performance differences. Only climbing speed and endurance differed among species. L. bedriagae excelled in both cases. Considering its microhabitat use, this seemed adaptive. 6, Unexpectedly, the interference experiments suggested that L. bedriagae is the least competitive of the three species.","Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium","Vanhooydonck, B (corresponding author), Univ Instelling Antwerp, Dept Biol, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium.",,,"Aerts, Peter/0000-0002-6867-5421; Van Damme, Raoul/0000-0002-4585-6940",,,,66,64,70,2,15,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Roots and rhizomes were identified to the species level by tracking their connections to above-ground parts, 2 Fine-scale horizontal heterogeneity of total root and rhizome biomass at different depths was recorded at the same time in the same grassland. 3 Both pairwise and multivariate statistical analysis showed that in the 0-3 cm layer the frequencies of roots and rhizomes of individual plants were closely coupled to the occurrence of the same species immediately above-ground. In contrast, in the 3-6 cm layer, these correlations peaked when root and rhizome frequencies were compared with plants above-ground displaced by a horizontal distance of 2 cm, This confirms the predominantly inclined growth of both roots and rhizomes; while the inclined growth has been shown regularly by studying single plants, the current study shows its prevalence at the community level as well. 4 The similarity to the above-ground patterns in the upper soil layer was due to the spatial constraints of plant presence above-ground; in contrast, the spatial patterns in the 3-6 cm layer were independent of plant presence above-ground. The role of root growth plasticity is discussed in this context. 5 Autocorrelation analysis of the root data revealed that there was a pronounced difference in the grain of horizontal spatial pattern between total root biomass and species-specific root frequencies. AII the species had rather loose root systems and clumps of one species rarely extended more than 0.5cm. In contrast, there was significant long-range clumping of root biomass up to 10cm, The below-ground heterogeneities in overall biomass and in species-specific distributions were therefore probably determined by different environmental processes. 6 No such difference in clumping range between total biomass and species-specific frequencies was observed in above-ground parts. This was attributed to homogeneity of the above-ground resource (light) compared with the inherently heterogeneous nature of the below-ground resources, and the different nature of competition for these resources may account for differences in vegetation patterns above- and below-ground.","Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; Univ Utrecht, Dept Plant Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands","Pechackova, S (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic.",pechackova@ibot.cas.cz,/G-1804-2014,/0000-0002-6636-0012,,,,49,38,43,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0477,1365-2745,,J ECOL,J.

A model of resource competition predicts that increases in diversity cause community stability to increase, but population stability to decrease. These opposite effects are, to a great extent, explained by how temporal variances in species abundances scale with mean abundance, and by the differential impact of this scaling on population vs. community stability. Community stability also depends on a negative covariance effect (competitive compensation) and on overyielding (ecosystem productivity increasing with diversity). A long-term study in Minnesota grasslands supports these predictions. Models of competition predict, and field experiments confirm, that greater plant diversity leads to greater primary productivity. This diversity-productivity relationship results both from the greater chance that a more productive speicies would be present at higher diversity (the sampling effect) and from the better coverage of habitat heterogeneity caused by the broader range of species traits in a more diverse community (the niche differentiation effect). Both effects cause more complete utilization of limiting resources at higher diversity, which increases resource retention, further increasing productivity. Finally, lower levels of available limiting resources at higher diversity are predicted to decrease the susceptibility of an ecosystem to invasion, supporting the diversity-invasibility hypothesis. This mechanism provides rules for community assembly and invasion resistance. In total, biodiversity should be added to species composition, disturbance, nutrient supply, and climate as a major controller of population and ecosystem dynamics and structure. By their increasingly great directional impacts on all of these controllers, humans are likely to cause major long-term changes in the functioning of ecosystems worldwide. A better understanding of these ecosystem changes is needed if ecologists are to provide society with the knowledge essential for wise management of the earth and its biological resources.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Tilman, D (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",,,,,,,108,1147,1272,30,1252,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1999,80,5,,,,,1455,1474,,10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[1455:TECOCI]2.0.CO;2,,,20,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,281XZ,WOS:000085187900001,,,,,2021-09-21,

The evidence that links observed responses of rodents to habitat variables is largely correlative, and theories on mechanisms of recovery are often simplified or speculative. Experimental manipulations of resources, competitive interactions and predation rates are proposed as the best way to clarify which factors are most influential upon individuals, populations and communities in the post-fire environment.","Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; Univ Sydney, Inst Wildlife Res, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Sutherland, EF (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",,"Dickman, Christopher/Q-4662-2019","Dickman, Christopher/0000-0002-1067-3730",,,,84,107,118,1,37,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1035-3712,1448-5494,,WILDLIFE RES,Wildl.

The occurrence of one or more shifts in resource use in an individual of a given species during its life should mean that it would also belong to different guilds at different life stages. We specifically addressed this issue by describing the feeding habits of ten species of carnivorous fishes occurring in tidepools in rocky intertidal areas along the coast of central Chile. Most of these species undergo clear ontogenetic dietary shifts and a feeding guild structure of this group of fishes was established that takes these dietary shifts into account. Each species was divided into a number of size classes. Dietary overlap values between both intraspecific and interspecific size-class pairs in the entire group of ten species were used to construct EI phenogram of dietary similarity through an UPGMA cluster analysis. Numbers of guilds and their memberships were established objectively by applying a boot strapping procedure. Four ontogenetic feeding guilds (OFGs), each consisting of size-classes of species, were recognized. The majority of species belonged to more that one guild. Interestingly, when the bootstrapping procedure was applied to a phenogram based on the diets of taxonomic or complete species, only one significant guild was found. The implications of these ontogenetic dietary shifts for interspecific interactions are substantial because the identity of the species with which each fish species shares resources change through their lives. The usefulness of taxonomic species for investigating potential competitive interactions in this assemblage is greatly undermined.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile","Ojeda, FP (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Casilla 114-D, Santiago, Chile.",pojeda@genes.bio.puc.cl,,,,,,60,98,112,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,1998,114,4,,,,,563,573,,10.1007/s004420050481,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,ZR339,WOS:000073964200014,28307906,,,,2021-09-21,

Our model shows that the mixing rate between the source and sink resource populations has a dramatic influence on the outcome of competition. When there is a strict sink-source dependence, so that resource renewal in the sink is entirely dependent on the source, only exploitation competition decides which species can survive at a very small mixing rate. Increasing the flow rate basically amounts to increasing the role played by interference competition. If interspecific interference is very small, compared with intraspecific interference, increasing the mixing rate allows coexistence of many species, indeed, unlimited coexistence if the species' resource exploitation efficiencies are similar enough. If interspecific interference is significant and there is a trade-off between the exploitation and interference competitive abilities of two species, it is possible to have one species replacing the other along a gradient of increasing mixing rate, with either coexistence or alternative single-species equilibria at intermediate values of the mixing rate. It is also possible to have one species always outcompeting the other, or alternative single-species stable equilibria at large mixing rates. When the strict sink-source dependence is relaxed by allowing the resource to have a partly independent renewal-loss dynamics in the sink area, the variety of possible outcomes along a gradient of mixing rate is further increased. These outcomes are often strongly sensitive to the parameters of resource dynamics and interspecific interference competition. The implications of these results for biological conservation can be profound; detailed knowledge of interspecific interactions appears to be necessary to determine the effect of any land management that alters dispersal opportunities.

We first tested an underlying assumption of the food competition hypothesis, using data on the prey consumed by Anolis aeneus. This assumption is that SSD reduces intersexual food competition relative to the amount of competition expected if males and females are the same size. Contrary to this assumption, estimates of food competition were lower if males and females were the same size than if males were larger than females or vice versa. Next, we tested the prediction from both hypotheses that SSD should be positively related to female density, using data from 25 taxa (24 species) of anoles. Statistically significant relationships between these two variables were obtained in the vast majority of potentially correct phylogenies for the species in this data set, based on either a gradual or a speciational model of evolution. In addition to documenting a relationship between SSD and density, this study shows how comparative questions can be pursued in taxa that currently lack a definitive phylogeny.","WASHINGTON UNIV, DEPT BIOL, ST LOUIS, MO 63130 USA; VIRGINIA POLYTECH INST & STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, BLACKSBURG, VA 24061 USA","Stamps, JA (corresponding author), LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATL LAB, SECT EVOLUT & ECOL, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA.",,"Stamps, Judy A/A-5142-2010","Andrews@vt.edu, Robin/0000-0001-6974-3732",,,,134,94,100,0,18,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

On average 50% of foraging observations were in mixed-species foraging aggregations, but with extensive interspecific variation. The occurrence of mixed-species foraging aggregations was relatively constant from the end of May until early July, with no indication that the appearance of fledglings increased the frequency of aggregations. These mixed-species foraging aggregations consisted of a wide variety of species in terms of foraging niche: typical flycatchers, specialized arboreal insectivores, and generalists were observed foraging together. The titmice species (Parus spp.) seemed to be preferred as foraging companions. The sites where foraging aggregations were observed did not differ from an equal number of randomly chosen sites with respect to forest vegetation structure. The dispersion of individuals in study areas was analysed using a 50 m x 50 m quadrat as the sampling unit. Altogether, 96 quadrats were surveyed. The dispersion of individual birds with respect to individuals of other species was non-random, and significantly clumped within quadrats. We used two playback experiments to test whether the aggregations were due to active search for heterospecific companions. In the first experiment, 20 randomly assigned sites received two 10-min treatments: willow tit (Parus montanus) song and silence as control. In the second experiment, we had two control treatments at 30 playback sites for the willow tit sons, the song of the olive-sided flycatcher (Contopus borealis) and classical music. More species were observed during willow tit song than during any of the controls. This suggests that aggregated dispersion pattern and the existence of mixed-species foraging aggregations were due to active search for heterospecific companions, and also that recognition of neighbouring species was involved. We suggest that birds actively aggregate in mixed-species Foraging groups to gain protection against predators and/or enhance feeding efficiency. The results support the view that positive interactions have an importance in structuring northern breeding bird communities.","FINNISH GAME & FISHERIES RES INST,MELTAUS GAME RES STN,FIN-97340 MELTAUS,FINLAND","Monkkonen, M (corresponding author), UNIV OULU,DEPT BIOL,POB 333,FIN-90571 OULU,FINLAND.",,"Monkkonen, Mikko/A-2821-2011; Forsman, Jukka/H-5345-2012","Monkkonen, Mikko/0000-0001-8897-3314",,,,50,62,65,0,45,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1996,77,1,,,,,127,136,,10.2307/3545592,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VQ986,WOS:A1996VQ98600014,,,,,2021-09-21,

Spatial patterns at regional and local scales were examined for evidence that species interactions can influence distribution and abundance within a guild of benthic fishes in upland streams of Oklahoma, U.S.A. Three groups of community patterns were examined: the species-area relationship, species-habitat associations, and interspecific associations. 2. The species-area relationship for riffle habitats was compared to a null species-area model based on random placement. The observed species-area curve was steeper resulting in less species per unit area in small streams than predicted by the null model. 3. Small, species-poor streams had summed fish densities at least as high as larger, species-rich streams, suggesting density compensation. 4. Several significant patterns of negative covariation were found among species at the regional scale, before and after statistically accounting for effects due to measured habitat variables. 5. For two of these negatively covarying taxa (Cottus carolinae and Etheostoma spectabile), the influence of each species on the distribution of the other was evaluated experimentally in field enclosures varying in depth and current velocity. The sculpin C. carolinae caused a shift in habitat use by the darter E. spectabile, but no reciprocal shift was found. 6. These results indicate an agreement between local and regional patterns of distribution for C. carolinae and E. spectabile and suggest that biotic interactions can influence regional patterns of distribution for species within this guild.","UNIV OKLAHOMA, DEPT ZOOL, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA; UNIV OKLAHOMA, OKLAHOMA BIOL SURVEY, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA",,,,,,,,62,55,57,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

In a graphical analysis, relationships between aggression and social and ecological factors were explored. Increasing relatedness between individuals was predicted to reduce aggressive encounters, except when correlates of fitness (e.g. body size) differed between individuals and/or when environmental conditions increased the profitability of aggression. These predictions were tested in a multifactorial experiment in which genetic relatedness, food quantity, relative body size and the potential for physical encounters were manipulated. The effects of each factor and their interactions on larval aggression and correlates of fitness (body size and timing of metamorphosis) were examined. Frequency of aggression depended upon an interaction between kinship, food quantity and relative larval size. Thus, in accordance with our graphical model, kinship-based aggression varied in a context-dependent fashion. Low food level reduced body size and increased the time required to reach metamorphosis. When larvae were not separated by a barrier, growth was inhibited in the smaller, but not the larger, individual of a pair. Moreover, the larval period was significantly shortened in chambers where barriers were absent. Neither kinship nor initial relative size, either alone or in combination with the other factors, significantly affected larval performance. These results show that the frequency of larval aggression in A. opacum depends upon prevailing social and environmental conditions; however, the influence of aggression on larval growth and metamorphosis remains unclear. Previous inferences regarding context-dependent kin discrimination in amphibians have been based on independent, interspecific studies or concurrent, intraspecific comparisons between individuals of alternative morphologies. The present results provide direct evidence that simultaneous variation in multiple socio-ecological factors may alter aggression in a single amphibian species in which kin discrimination is known to occur.

Both species exhibited similar microhabitat usage when alone, When refugia were absent, both species suffered heavy mortality. Shifts in microhabitat use when refugia were present resulted in increased survivorship of larvae. Behaviors resulting in habitat partitioning and the use of refugia by larvae may be important components for the coexistence of A. maculatum and A. jeffersonianum in breeding ponds.

The ability of competing models to predict ecosystem change is assessed in terms of ecosystem organising processes and attributes such as competition, resistance and resilience, temporal thresholds and feedback. The ability to detect change is viewed in terms of detection at the community and landscape scales. Relevance to management and communication are assessed within the context of effectively communicating the effects of management decisions on ecosystem processes to both traditional and non-traditional decision makers and a larger public constituency.

I studied 7 southern European communities of 3-6 breeding species of herons. Foraging habitats and prey types varied widely among regions for each heron species, while prey weights varied less. Principal Components Analysis characterized each heron species by its use of a specific key resource, composed of combinations of prey size, foraging habitat and prey type, in order of decreasing importance. The largest herons (grey and purple) and the smallest (squacco heron) were characterized by specific prey weights and types, while the intermediate sized herons (little egret and night heron) were characterized by prey types and foraging habitats. Similarities among heron species in habitat use' prey types and prey weights were significantly higher than random in only a few species-pairs, and no value was significantly lower than random. Aggressions were infrequent both against conspecifics and heterospecifics. When compared with explicit predictions of the hypotheses that resource use is shaped by opportunism, independent selectivity, or inter-species competition, the patterns observed indicate that heron species, although partially selective for prey size, tend opportunistically to use similar habitats and prey types, presumably the most profitable and locally abundant.

We evaluated 61 vegetation variables from individual vireo territories and equivalent scrubland plots unoccupied by vireos. Principal components indicated strong vegetation trends for all plots involving the abundance of junipers (from high to low) and openness (from low to high) extending from the Lampasas Cut Plains to the Wichita Mountains and then to the Edwards Plateau. In all regions, vireo territories had relatively high densities of deciduous vegetation (primarily oaks) close to the ground (i.e., up to 1-2 m, and in one region 3 m). In addition, vireo territories occurred where variation in relative density measures of woody vegetation was highest. However, even with the vireo's limited geographic range, differences were found among regions in the vegetational characteristics of areas defended by territorial males. Vireos avoided higher juniper densities on the Lampasas Cut Plains and more open areas on the Edwards Plateau. On the Edwards Plateau, with generally less dense vegetation and the lowest density of junipers, the older (ASY; after-second-year) males selected territories with higher juniper densities at lower height intervals than found on nonvireo plots. Territories of second-year males (SY) and older males (ASY) differed in vegetation characteristics. On the Edwards Plateau, SY males occupied territories with vegetation structurally more like nonvireo plots than like territories of ASY males. In the Wichita Mountains, where a remnant vireo population occurs, territories of SY males were similar to those of ASY males. In both regions, however, SY males were found in more open habitats. Competition with other foliage-gleaning species may have played a role in restricting the Black-capped Vireo to early successional stages of scrubland habitats, where they also may effectively avoid several species of nest predators. Periodic habitat disturbance has beneficial effects for vireos and can be used in management of this endangered species. Attempts should be made to maintain 35 to 55% dispersed scrub cover (primarily deciduous) in spatially heterogeneous configurations. Sometimes inherent site characteristics (e.g., poor soils) may naturally promote the degree of vegetational heterogeneity requisite for Black-capped Vireos. Managers should employ techniques that encourage thick regrowth of deciduous woody vegetation. Typically, juniper cover should be kept well below 10%, which may be possible only through habitat manipulation. However, in areas where amounts of deciduous vegetation are marginal (e.g., Edwards Plateau region and to the southwest), junipers may contribute important cover. Thus, site and regional characteristics need consideration when making decisions about juniper control.","USA,CONSTRUCT ENGN RES LABS,DIV NAT RESOURCES,CHAMPAIGN,IL 61826; UNIV OKLAHOMA,OKLAHOMA BIOL SURVEY,NORMAN,OK 73019; UNIV OKLAHOMA,DEPT ZOOL,NORMAN,OK 73019","GRZYBOWSKI, JA (corresponding author), UNIV CENT OKLAHOMA,DEPT BIOL,EDMOND,OK 73034, USA.",,,,,,,72,44,47,0,9,COOPER ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897",0010-5422,,,CONDOR,Condor,MAY,1994,96,2,,,,,512,544,,10.2307/1369333,,,33,Ornithology,Zoology,NN823,WOS:A1994NN82300021,,,,,2021-09-21,

The leeches, Erpobdella octoculata, Glossiphonia complattata and Helobdella stagnalis, and their prey were manipulated inside experimental enclosures, matched by controls, erected on the stony shore of an eutrophic, English lake. 2. Five separate manipulations were performed: the addition of tubificid oligochaetes, the addition of snails, the increase in numbers of G. complanata and H. stagnalis, the increase in numbers of E. octoculata, and the reduction in numbers of all three leech species. All invertebrates were sampled, using trays buried in the substratum, in early March, prior to leech reproduction, in July and in late October/early November when breeding had ceased. Leech manipulations were executed immediately after the first sampling of invertebrates, when food addition, at fortnightly intervals, also commenced. 3. The addition of tubificids resulted in significantly greater numbers and biomasses of E. octoculata and H. stagnalis in the experimental compared to the control sites in the autumn sample, i.e. after breeding. The same was true for G. complanata when snails were added. When the numbers of leeches were either decreased or increased, no significant differences in numbers or biomass of the manipulated species were obtained in the autumn. 4. Elevation or readjustment of leech numbers appeared to be achieved through changes in juvenile mortality and to a lesser extent through fecundity. 5. Current results, together with previous findings, provide evidence for food limitation, with a high mortality of recruited young (up to 98%) which is linked to food supply. There is also some evidence for interspecific competition for food, though the occurrence of food refuges, the temporal separation of breeding peaks, and differences in feeding behaviour, involving body size and foraging strategies, between the glossiphoniids reduce the intensity of interactions.","UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND",,,,,,,,26,8,8,0,3,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Hard clams emigrated more in the presence of G. gemma than in its absence in both laboratory and field experiments. The overall effect of reduced food was increased emigration. Presence of G. gemma in sand enhanced hard clam growth while not affecting survival, but in muddy sand growth and survival decreased. Hard clams grew best in muddy sand without gem clams. In further experiments hard clams grew faster in shallower sediments and slower with addition of G. gemma biodeposits. We conclude that undisturbed post-settlement M mercenaria grow more slowly than they are capable of because they spend part of the time buried, presumably to avoid surface predators. Clams that are kept near the sediment surface, either because of sedimentary properties or interaction with spatial competitors, grow considerably faster than undisturbed clams in sand. This interpretation implies a trade-off between opposing selective pressures such that clams partition time between the necessary risk of feeding and the safe but energetically unprofitable sub-surface refuge from predation.","SUNY, MARINE SCI RES CTR, STONY BROOK, NY 11794 USA; KOREA OCEAN RES & DEV INST, POLAR RES CTR, SEOUL 425600, SOUTH KOREA; OREGON STATE UNIV, OREGON SEA GRANT INST, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA",,,,,,,,38,15,15,0,2,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

All the potentially limiting resources (seasonal time, diel time, habitat and food) are analyzed as single niche dimensions, and then the real multidimensional niche is calculated. Resource states are objectively defined, using an algorithm that groups the significant resource categories. The larvae were segregated by prey, season, habitat, and water depth, in order of decreasing importance; their overlap was very low when their complete multidimensional niche was considered, and therefore they have few opportunities for present-day competition. The adults were largely segregated by season and water depth, and to a lesser degree by habitat and prey; their multidimensional niches overlapped to a certain degree, thus leaving conditions for ongoing competition. Considering all the species and the life stages together, the order of importance for segregation was season, prey, habitat, water depth and diel activity, with a low overlap in the complete niche. Differences in prey size were probably due to morphological constraints; differences in diel activity had very little effect on segregation, except in separating larvae from the adults, and were likely promoted by need to avoid mutual predation and cannibalism. It remains to be tested whether seasonal, habitat, and water depth differences are due to competitive pressures or to ecophysiological constraints.","DIPARTIMENTO BIOL ANIM, PIAZZA BOTTA 9, I-27100 PAVIA, ITALY",,,,"FASOLA, MAURO/0000-0002-7366-5893",,,,34,33,33,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,JAN-MAR,1993,16,1,,,,,73,81,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.1993.tb00060.x,,,9,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KP391,WOS:A1993KP39100009,,,,,2021-09-21,

Experimental evidence in support of this concept has been presented only for bryozoans. We present an experimental rejection of the hypothesis of the independence of food and space as factors limiting individual growth in small groups of blue mussel Mytilus edulis (L.). Mussels were grown in the laboratory, using natural seawater. In the present experiment, physical interference (crowding) and exploitative competition for food did co-occur. Growth of mussels changed from positive to negative along an assumed food gradient in series of the chambers employed in this experiment. In addition, growth was severely impeded by interference in small individuals, but not in large individuals: competition was asymmetrical with respect to size. We present a model of this interaction based on a biomechanical analysis of the effect of reduction of shell gape in neighbouring mussels interacting together. The model predicts that the effect of interference on individual growth is size-dependent and can be determined in terms of the shell-length / body-mass relationship. In the context of predicting self-thinning slopes in bivalves, our data strongly suggest that simultaneous occurrence of physical interference and exploitative competition results in a steepening of the expected slope (beta) of space-limited self-thinning relationships, when log biomass (B) is expressed as a function of log density (N) in the equation log B = log k + beta-log N.",,"FRECHETTE, M (corresponding author), MINIST PECHES & OCEANS, INST MAURICE LAMONTAGNE, CP 1000, Mont Joli G5H 3Z4, QUEBEC, CANADA.",,,,,,,40,74,77,1,10,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Although such assumptions are generally not tested, the analyses and conclusions derived depend on nonrandom patterns' being present. Several null or neutral models have been proposed to test for these patterns. We contrast two of the more prevalent models and develop two new models, subsequently evaluating them with five sets of fish community data. Three of the null models provide similar results, from which it is concluded that fish communities from five regions of Ontario are nonrandomly structured. These three models evaluate pairs of species according to departures from null or random co-occurrence expectations, A Monte Carlo model based on the procedure proposed by E. F. Connor and D. Simberloff supports random community organization, but we attribute this discrepancy to the conservative pooling of species-pair information in that model. We recommend a hybrid model combining Monte Carlo and log-linear methods for future studies, although the log-linear model of M. E. Gilpin and J. M. Diamond provides a reasonable approximation. On the basis of species associations derived from the various models, we attribute much of the nonrandom structure to common habitat requirements among co-occurring species. A predominance of positively associated species generally involves pairs of species with similar ecological characteristics. Strong negative associations typically involve predator-prey species.

These enclosures allowed each species to experience environmental conditions within each lake without directly interacting with each other. In the four-species lake, two other sets of enclosures addressed the effects of intra- and interspecific competition. Changes in total biomass of enclosure stocks (from growth and mortality) indicated that in the absence of other species, perch did best in the lake containing the richest fish assemblage, intermediate in the two-species lake, and worst in the mudminnow-only lake. Mudminnow stocks similarly performed significantly better in the four-species lake than the mudminnow-only lake. These results suggest that the lakes' environmental conditions contribute to the patterns of presence and abundance of perch, but that interspecific interactions override a similar contribution for the mudminnow, which is regarded as a fugitive species.

After a 2-year pretreatment period, 80% of the adult white sucker population was removed from Douglas Lake, Michigan, with trap nets set during the spring spawning season of 1987. Following white sucker removal, the abundance of chironomid larvae and the mayfly Caenis sp. increased 13-18-fold in Douglas Lake. In Little Bear Lake, the control lake, Caenis sp. showed a 20% decline in abundance during the study period (1985-1989), and chironomid larvae showed a 2.2-fold increase over the same time period. Associated with the increase in benthic invertebrate abundance in Douglas Lake, the diet of adult (> age-0) yellow perch shifted from predominantly zooplankton to predominantly benthos. This shift was accompanied by an increase in mean stomach content weight and feeding rate, eventually becoming apparent as increased growth. Relatively small changes in feeding rate and no trend in the diet or growth rate of adult yellow perch were apparent in the reference lake. The size structure of the adult yellow perch population in Douglas Lake showed a small increase in the proportion of large (> 150 mm total length) individuals during the first 3 years following white sucker removal and a great increase during the fourth year. In the control lake, no significant change in the population size structure of yellow perch was observed. From these results, we suggest that removal of adult white suckers can be a useful management tool to improve yellow perch growth and the quality of yellow perch fisheries. Changes in yellow perch growth and size structure, however, did not occur immediately after white sucker removal and were relatively small in magnitude during the duration of this study.","MICHIGAN DEPT NAT RESOURCES,INST FISHERIES RES,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109; MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,DEPT FISHERIES & WILDLIFE,E LANSING,MI 48824",,,,,,,,49,34,36,1,19,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE SUITE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199",0002-8487,,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

The larvae of two pond-breeding salamanders, Ambystoma maculatum and A. talpoideum, exhibit several behavioral displays that are employed during interspecific competitive interactions. Biting (BITE), lunging (LUNGE, unsuccessful bite attempts), movement toward (MT), and looking toward (LT) an opponent function as aggression, whereas movement away (MA) from an opponent functions as submission. Significantly more winners of conflicts than losers were aggressive both before and after an act of overt aggression (BITE and LUNGE), whereas significantly more losers than winners were submissive after BITE and LUNGE. Overall, winners of contests were significantly larger than were losers. Contests in which both larvae exchanged multiple acts of BITE or LUNGE were initiated by smaller larvae, however, with aggression reciprocated from the larger opponent. Such reciprocity was not observed in contests in which the larger individual initiated an attack. These data indicate that relative body size is an important correlate with aggressive superiority and that the use of passive behavioral displays may establish the superiorities of competitors while minimizing the incidence of injurious bites.","UNIV SW LOUISIANA, DEPT BIOL, LAFAYETTE, LA 70504 USA; UNIV ZURICH, INST ZOOL, CH-8057 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND",,,,,,,,31,31,33,0,9,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS & HERPETOLOGISTS,MIAMI,"MAUREEN DONNELLY, SECRETARY FLORIDA INT UNIV BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 11200 SW 8TH STREET, MIAMI, FL 33199 USA",0045-8511,1938-5110,,COPEIA,Copeia,DEC 13,1991,,4,,,,,936,942,,10.2307/1446089,,,7,Zoology,Zoology,GW221,WOS:A1991GW22100006,,,,,2021-09-21,

The weight of tubes of P. elegans varied between 2 and 13 g DW/100 cm2 at the two stations investigated and during the year, which is equivalent to 230-1500 cm of tubes per 100 cm2 of sediment surface. Sediment stability may be affected directly or indirectly by the amount of tubes present. M. balthica shows a linear relation between the maximum size of particles which can be inhaled and animal length. In Kiel Bay, particles > 0.5 mm are out of the range of this species. In summer, the potential feeding area (PFA) of a P. elegans population at one station in Kiel Bay was 1.8 times the available surface area. The PFA of three different populations of M. balthica in Kiel Bay exceeded the available surface area by factors of 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2. These findings indicate strong intra- and interspecific competition for food. Additionally, the feeding of both species may strongly affect the recruitment of benthic species via pelagic larvae.

We asked (a) What are the relative effects of variation in environmental, land use (i.e., anthropogenic), and spatial factors on the variation in the species composition of component communities (i.e., in a locality)? and (b) What is the dominant pattern of species associations in infracommunities (in a host individual), and how do these associations vary along environmental and/or anthropogenic gradients? In component communities, the greatest portion of variation in helminth species composition was explained by the combined effects of space, anthropogenic pressure, and NDVI, with the pure effect of the spatial predictor being much stronger than the effects of the remaining predictors. In infracommunities, the probability of occurrence of some, but not all, helminth species depended on the occurrence of another species, with the numbers of negative and positive co-occurrences being equal. The strength and/or sign of associations of some species pairs were spatially stable, whereas interactions between other species pairs varied along the gradient of the amount of green vegetation, from negative to positive and vice versa. We conclude that the processes in parasite infracommunities and component communities in frogs are intertwined, with both bottom-up and top-down effects acting at different hierarchical scales.","[Rubenina, Ilze; Kirjusina, Muza; Ceirans, Andris; Gravele, Evita; Gavarane, Inese; Pupins, Mihails] Daugavpils Univ, Inst Life Sci & Technol, Parades St 1A, LV-5401 Daugavpils, Latvia; [Krasnov, Boris R.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, Swiss Inst Dryland Environm & Energy Res, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Sede Boger Campus, Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel","Rubenina, I (corresponding author), Daugavpils Univ, Inst Life Sci & Technol, Parades St 1A, LV-5401 Daugavpils, Latvia.",ilze.rubenina@du.lv,,,,,,102,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0932-0113,1432-1955,,PARASITOL RES,Parasitol.

To date, little is known about the spatio-temporal interactions of ungulates in forested habitats. Using camera traps, we investigated the spatio-temporal responses of alpine chamois to the presence of red deer in the mountain forests of northern Croatia during the four seasons of 2018/2019. We hypothesized that chamois activity patterns should be affected by the presence of red deer, leading to either temporal or spatial segregation between the species. Our results showed that chamois tended to be more active during the day when red deer were absent, and showed contrasting patterns of activity across seasons, from bimodal to multimodal. However, temporal overlap coefficients between chamois and red deer were moderate throughout the study period, ranging from 0.57 in summer to 0.68 in autumn. Conversely, we found inconsistent/random occupancy patterns of chamois and red deer at different camera trap locations in different seasons. Our results are among the few available data on the interaction of these two species in forested areas and suggest weak effects of red deer on the spatio-temporal behaviour of Alpine chamois. However, finer-scale data may be required to better understand the relationship between these species.","[Kavcic, Kresimir; Radocaj, Tena; Sprem, Nikica] Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Dept Fisheries Apiculture Wildlife Management & S, Svetosimunska Cesta 25, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Corlatti, Luca] Univ Freiburg, Chair Wildlife Ecol & Management, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Safner, Toni] Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Dept Plant Breeding Genet & Biometr, Svetosimunska Cesta 25, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Safner, Toni] Ctr Excellence Biodivers & Mol Plant Breeding CoE, Svetosimunska Cesta 25, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Gracanin, Ana; Mikac, Katarina M.] Univ Wollongong, Ctr Sustainable Ecosyst Solut, Sch Earth Atmospher & Life Sci, Fac Sci Med & Hlth, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia","Radocaj, T (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Dept Fisheries Apiculture Wildlife Management & S, Svetosimunska Cesta 25, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",tradocaj@agr.hr,,"Kavcic, Kresimir/0000-0002-2907-3911; Sprem, Nikica/0000-0002-3475-6653",RESBIOS European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program [872146],This study was supported by the RESBIOS European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program (No. 872146).,,54,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1616-5047,1618-1476,,MAMM BIOL,Mamm.

Those interactions can be neutral, positive, or negative for the species involved. Capuchin monkeys are medium-sized primates that can encounter both larger and smaller primates in their varied habitats. Gracile capuchins (Cebus) are reported to present different types of interactions with other primates. Interactions with howler monkeys frequently include physical aggression, while interactions with spider monkeys are mostly threats and chases. Moreover, interaction types are not consistent across populations. Among robust capuchins (Sapajus spp.), however, no reports have been published. Here we describe and classify encounters of Sapajus libidinosus and S. nigritus with Alouatta caraya, A. guariba, Brachyteles arachnoides, and Callithrix jacchus in three sites in the environments of Cerrado, Caatinga (savannah-like), and Atlantic forest, and compare the interaction patterns among sites and different group sizes. The latter is a factor that can influence the outcome, and we expected capuchins in larger groups to be more aggressive toward other primates. Our results of 8421 h of total contact with the capuchin groups show that, indeed, capuchins in sites with larger groups presented aggressive interactions with higher frequency. However, the other species' body size also seems important as smaller primates apparently avoided capuchins, and interactions with the larger muriquis were mostly neutral for the capuchin. Capuchins showed neutral or aggressive behaviors toward howler monkeys, with differences between the rainforest and savannah groups. We found that robust capuchins can present aggressive interactions even to primates larger than themselves and that aggressive behavior was the most common response in populations living in larger groups and drier environments.","[Falotico, Tiago] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Arts Sci & Humanities, Av Arlindo Bettio 1000,Predio CMP1,Sala T6, BR-03828000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Falotico, Tiago; Mendonca-Furtado, Olivia; Fogaca, Mariana Dutra; Verderane, Michele P.] Neotrop Primates Res Grp, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Mendonca-Furtado, Olivia] Natl Inst Atlantic Forest, Santa Teresa, Brazil; [Mendonca-Furtado, Olivia; Fogaca, Mariana Dutra; Tokuda, Marcos; Ottoni, Eduardo B.; Verderane, Michele P.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Psychol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Fogaca, Mariana Dutra] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Vienna, Austria; [Tokuda, Marcos] Quinzinho Barros Municipal Zool Pk, Sorocaba, Brazil","Falotico, T (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Arts Sci & Humanities, Av Arlindo Bettio 1000,Predio CMP1,Sala T6, BR-03828000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.; Falotico, T (corresponding author), Neotrop Primates Res Grp, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",tfalotico@gmail.com,"Falotico, Tiago/I-1918-2012; Ottoni, Eduardo Benedicto/E-4941-2012; Verderane, Michele/E-3078-2013","Falotico, Tiago/0000-0002-0638-1989; Ottoni, Eduardo Benedicto/0000-0003-1288-8345; Verderane, Michele/0000-0001-8467-8385; Dutra Fogaca, Mariana/0000-0002-6776-9389","FUMDHAM; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2006/07187-5, 2013/05219- 0, 2018/01292- 9, 2006/07190-6, 2014/04818-0, 2006/51578- 9, 2009/50182-2, 2008/52293, 2008/55684-3, 2009/51589-9]; CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [140651/2010-1, 381215/2019]; CapesCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)","T.F. and E.B.O. thank FUMDHAM and Niede Guidon for their support during the research in SCNP, and the field assistants Francisco Chico Reinaldo and George Reinaldo.

In this context, microbial interactions with these non-Saccharomyces species must be considered for a rational design of yeast starter combinations. Previously, transcriptional responses of S. cerevisiae to short-term co-cultivation with Torulaspora delbrueckii, Candida sake, or Hanseniaspora uvarum was compared. An activation of sugar consumption and glycolysis, membrane and cell wall biogenesis, and nitrogen utilization was observed, suggesting a metabolic boost of S. cerevisiae in response to competing yeasts. In the present study, the transcription profile of S. cerevisiae was analyzed after 3 h of cell contact with Metschnikowia pulcherrima. Results show an overexpression of the gluco-fermentative pathway much stronger than with the other species. Moreover, a great repression of the respiration pathway has been found in response to Metschnikowia. Our hypothesis is that there is a direct interaction stress response (DISR) between S. cerevisiae and the other yeast species that, under excess sugar conditions, induces transcription of the hexose transporters, triggering glucose flow to fermentation and inhibiting respiration, leading to an increase in both, metabolic flow and population dynamics.","[Mencher, Ana; Morales, Pilar; Gonzalez, Ramon; Tronchoni, Jordi] Univ La Rioja, Inst Ciencias Vid & Vino, CSIC, Gobierno La Rioja, Logrono, La Rioja, Spain; [Tronchoni, Jordi] Univ Int Valencia, Valencia, Comunidad Valen, Spain; [Curiel, Jose A.] Ctr Invest & Desarrollo Alimento Func CIDAF, Granada, Andalucia, Spain","Tronchoni, J (corresponding author), Univ Int Valencia VIU, C Pintor Sorolla 21, Valencia 46002, Spain.",jtronchoni@universidadviu.com,"J.A., Curiel/H-8831-2015; Gonzalez, Ramon/G-9281-2011; Tronchoni, Jordi/A-7082-2015","J.A., Curiel/0000-0002-0111-1437; Gonzalez, Ramon/0000-0001-7388-1660; Tronchoni, Jordi/0000-0001-9227-2713","Spanish Government (MINECO/FEDER UE) [AGL2015-63629-R]; FGCSIC by the COMFUTURO program; MINECO [FPDI-2013-15520, BES-2016-077557]",This work was funded by the Spanish Government through grant AGL2015-63629-R (MINECO/FEDER UE).

Low densities of economically valuable sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) in understories are often common, likely driven by many factors, including deer browsing, management-dictated stand structure, and site fertility/moisture regimes. However, landscape sugar maple regeneration patterns and relationships with underlying factors are largely unknown. We quantified associations of spatially varying factors with sugar maple regeneration using detailed vegetation and white-tailed deer winter fecal pellet surveys from 141 northern hardwood stands in Michigan, managed for decades with single-tree selection silviculture. We developed models of plot-level sugar maple regeneration counts for three key size classes as a function of plot- and stand-level predictors, including deer use, forest structure, and site quality. Among our 141 stands, sugar maple seedlings (50 cm tall) were consistently abundant, averaging 69,000 stems ha(-1) and present in 76% of plots per stand, on average (25 plots per stand, each 2 m(2)). In contrast, small (50-137 cm tall) and large (5 cm DBH) sugar maple sapling densities were much lower, averaging 2,300 and 1,100 stems ha(-1), respectively, and occurring, on average, in 31% and 32% of plots per stand (25 plots per stand, each 12.6 m(2)). Under a wide range of potential sugar maple stocking criteria, most stands are understocked in saplings; e.g., only 29% of stands had 2,500 small sugar maple sapling stems ha(-1) and 35% of stands had > 1,000 large sapling stems ha(-1). Based on our models, sapling densities negatively associated with deer use and were more abundant on medium than high quality sites. Across all size classes, negative associations with subcanopy trees and/or shrub densities suggest light limitation, whereas positive associations with sugar maple canopy trees > 25 cm DBH suggest persistent seed limitations. Overall, our study supports need for alternative forest and/or deer management strategies over much of the range of northern hardwood forests in Michigan to promote higher densities of large sugar maple regeneration for canopy recruitment. Medium quality sites with abundant large sugar maple canopy trees and low deer browsing pressure (for example, the deep snow region in the north western Upper Peninsula) are the exception; high sugar maple sapling densities suggest forests in this region are thriving under single-tree selection management.","[Henry, Catherine R.; Walters, Michael B.; Finley, Andrew O.; Farinosi, Evan J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Roloff, Gary J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Henry, CR (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",henrycat@msu.edu,,,Michigan Department of Natural Resources; Michigan State University; Michigan State University Plant Science Fellowship; Hancock Timber Resource Group; Rohatyn Group,"This research was funded by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.

NOR increased the relative abundance of Scenedesmus species in the absence of grazers but exerted opposite effects when Daphnia was present in both short- and long-term experiments due to reduced colony size. Meanwhile, increasing NOR concentrations led to quickly increased total algal density in the initial stage, followed by a sharp decline in the long-term experiment in the absence of grazers; when Daphnia was present, population fluctuations were even larger for both prey and predator species (e.g., grazer extinction at the highest concentration). Thus, NOR affected the outcome of species interactions and decreased temporal stability of plankton ecosystems, suggesting that antibiotics have more extensive impacts than presently recognized.","[Pan, Ying; Dong, Jinyan; Wan, Lingling; Chang, Xuexiu] Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Pan, Ying; Dong, Jinyan; Wan, Lingling] Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Plateau Mt Ecol & Restorat Degrade, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Pan, Ying; Sun, Shucun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [MacIsaac, Hugh J.; Drouillard, Ken G.; Chang, Xuexiu] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9 B 3P4, Canada","Chang, XX (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China.; Chang, XX (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9 B 3P4, Canada.",changxx@ynu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31670440]; Yunnan Province Key Research Program for Science and Technology [2018BC002, 32017BC041]; Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of China [S201910673095]","We thank Shiwei Yan, Guangdi Yi, Dan Liu, Jun Luo, Yuhe Wu, Deqin Gao, Han Yang, Guanwen Chen, Jie-xin Tan, and Zi-yong Cao for their help with data collection.

The aim of this work was to infer the role that such interactions play in the population dynamics of psyllids and aphids in pear orchards. Interactions were inferred from field data and periodical sampling along a 4-year study, and from interaction assays performed under controlled conditions. RESULTS A decline in the abundance of the pear psyllid (Cacopsylla pyri L.), parallel to an increase in the abundance of aphids, was registered over 4 years. Ants were the dominant species, representing about 90% of the predators, followed by spiders and predatory hemipterans (namely Pilophorus gallicus Remane). Ant abundance increased over the 4 years, matching the population dynamics of aphids. Evidence of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions were found for ant-aphid and ant-psyllid, respectively: (i) ant-aphid abundances on pear trees were positively correlated, and ants reduced predation on aphids by generalist predators, and (ii) ant-psyllid abundances were negatively correlated, ants have a negative effect on the psyllid population growth rates, and ants were found to prey on the psyllid. CONCLUSIONS Because of their high abundance in comparison with other predators and the mutualistic-antagonistic relationships with aphids-psyllids, ants are considered to be the principal force behind the decline of pear psyllid populations and the increase in aphid numbers. In summary, ants contribute positively to biological control by the suppresion of pests (i.e. the psyllid) which are more damaging than those they protect (i.e. aphids).

This new approach challenges classical niche theory with potentially great ecological consequences, but so far has only scarce empirical support. Here, we investigated if and how consistent inter-individual differences in behavior predict space use and movement patterns in free-ranging bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and thereby contribute to individual niche specialization. Individuals were captured and marked from three different subpopulations in North-East Germany. Inter-individual differences in boldness and exploration were quantified via repeated standardized tests directly in the field after capture. Subsequently, space use and movement patterns of a representative sample of the behavioral variation (n=21 individuals) were monitored via automated VHF telemetry for a period of four days, yielding on average 384 locations per individual. Bolder individuals occupied larger home ranges and core areas (estimated via kernel density analyses), moved longer distances, spatially overlapped with fewer conspecifics and preferred different microhabitats based on vegetation cover compared to shyer individuals. We found evidence for personality-dependent space use, movement, and occupation of individual spatial niches in bank voles. Thus, besides dietary niche specialization also spatial dimensions of ecological niches vary among individuals within populations, which may have important consequences for ecological interactions within- and between species.","[Schirmer, Annika; Eccard, Jana A.; Dammhahn, Melanie] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Herde, Antje] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat, Potsdam, Germany; [Herde, Antje] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Anim Behav, Bielefeld, Germany","Schirmer, A (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Anim Ecol, Maulbeerallee 1, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany.",annika.schirmer@uni-potsdam.de,"Dammhahn, Melanie/AAD-5479-2019",,German Science Foundation (DFG) within the BioMove research training group [DFG-GRK2118/1],"Experiments were conducted under the permission of the Landesamt fur Umwelt, Verbraucherschutz und Gesundheit, Brandenburg (LUGV_7RO-4610/34 + 5#86908/2011; V3-2347-44-2011).

To better understand how carnivore communities are structured, we analysed camera trap data for 108087 trap days across 12 countries spanning five continents. We estimate local probabilities of co-occurrence among 768 species pairs from the order Carnivora and evaluate how shared ecological traits correlate with probabilities of co-occurrence. Within individual study areas, species pairs co-occurred more frequently than expected at random. Co-occurrence probabilities were greatest for species pairs that shared ecological traits including similar body size, temporal activity pattern and diet. However, co-occurrence decreased as compared to other species pairs when the pair included a large-bodied carnivore. Our results suggest that a combination of shared traits and top-down regulation by large carnivores shape local carnivore communities globally.","[Davis, Courtney L.; Murphy, Asia J.; Miller, David A.

Our goal is for both theoretical and empirical ecologists to be able to use the theory to interpret their findings, and to get a precise sense of the limits of its applicability. To this end, we introduce an explicit handling of limiting factors, and a new way of defining the scaling factors that partition invasion growth rates into the different mechanisms contributing to coexistence. We explain terminology such as relative nonlinearity, storage effect, and growth-density covariance, both in a formal setting and through their biological interpretation. We review the theory's applications and contributions to our current understanding of species coexistence. While the theory is very general, it is not well suited to all problems, so we carefully point out its limitations. Finally, we critique the paradigm of decomposing invasion growth rates into stabilizing and equalizing components: we argue that these concepts are useful when used judiciously, but have often been employed in an overly simplified way to justify false claims.","[Barabas, Gyoergy] Linkoping Univ, Div Theoret Biol, Dept IFM, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [D'Andrea, Rafael] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Stump, Simon Maccracken] Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Barabas, G (corresponding author), Linkoping Univ, Div Theoret Biol, Dept IFM, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",gyorgy.barabas@liu.se,"D'Andrea, Rafael/I-2588-2019","D'Andrea, Rafael/0000-0001-9687-6178",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [VR 2017-05245]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1457515],"We would like to thank Robin Snyder and an anonymous reviewer for their helpful and supportive suggestions; Peter Adler, Evan K.

Given that species interactions can have significant positive and negative effects on wood-decay fungal activity, one possibility is that biotic processes serve as the primary controls on community function, with abiotic controls emerging only after species associations are accounted for. Here we explore this hypothesis in a factorial field warming- and nitrogen-addition experiment by examining relationships among wood decomposition rates, fungal activity, and fungal community structure. We show that functional outcomes and community structure are largely unrelated to abiotic conditions, with microsite and plot-level abiotic variables explaining at most 19% of the total variability in decomposition and fungal activity, and 2% of the variability in richness and evenness. In contrast, taxonomic richness, evenness, and species associations (i.e., co-occurrence patterns) exhibited strong relationships with community function, accounting for 52% of the variation in decomposition rates and 73% in fungal activity. A greater proportion of positive vs. negative species associations in a community was linked to strong declines in decomposition rates and richness. Evenness emerged as a key mediator between richness and function, with highly even communities exhibiting a positive richness-function relationship and uneven communities exhibiting a negative or null response. These results suggest that community-assembly processes and species interactions are important controls on the function of wood-decay fungal communities, ultimately overwhelming substantial differences in abiotic conditions.","[Maynard, Daniel S.] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 1101 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Maynard, Daniel S.; Covey, Kristofer R.; Sokol, Noah W.; Bradford, Mark A.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Crowther, Thomas W.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Univ Str 16, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Morrison, Eric W.; Frey, Serita D.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [van Diepen, Linda T.

In principle, persistent, directional changes in communities are only predicted when community properties covary genetically with the fitness of resident species. Estimates of genetic covariance between the fitness of a resident species and its community are therefore necessary to close the eco-evolutionary loop in studies of community genetics, but such estimates are rare. Emulating community genetics experiments in plants, we used clonal replicates of 21 genotypes of a resident species (the encrusting bryozoan, Hippopodina) to investigate the magnitude of genotypic variance contributing to assembly of a marine benthic community. Genotypes explained up to 35% of variation in community assembly. Critically, the performance of Hippopodina genotypes covaried both with the evenness of communities and with the abundances of some individual species, representing an indirect genetic effect that creates the potential for multigenerational interactions between Hippopodina and co-existing species. Our results suggest that different genotypes will associate with different community members consistently across generations, and such non-random associations can give rise to specialization. Further interactions between species other than Hippopodina itself may also be altered by effects of genetic variation in the focal species. Furthermore, species in the community other than Hippopodina itself will interact more commonly in the presence of some genotypes over others. Our results support the potential for genetic variation in one species to have deterministic effects on the dynamics of ecological communities.","[Riedel, Arthur M.; Blows, Mark W.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Monro, Keyne; Marshall, Dustin J.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia","Riedel, AM (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",arthur_riedel@mac.com,"Monro, Keyne/J-7418-2019","Marshall, Dustin/0000-0001-6651-6219",University of Queensland Research ScholarshipUniversity of Queensland; UQ International Research Tuition Award; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,University of Queensland Research Scholarship; UQ International Research Tuition Award; Australian Research Council,,70,0,0,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Traditionally, these functions are described with a fixed functional form with temporally constant parameters and without species interactions. The Ricker stock-recruitment model is one such function that is commonly used in fisheries stock assessment. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in semiparametric and temporally varying population growth models. The former are related to the general statistical approach of using semiparametric discrepancy functions, such as Gaussian processes (GP), to model deviations around the expected parametric function. In the latter, the reproductive rate, which is a key parameter describing the population growth rate, is assumed to vary in time. In this work, we introduce how these existing Ricker population growth models can be formulated under the same statistical approach of hierarchical GP models. We also show how the time invariant semiparametric approach can be extended and combined with the time varying reproductive rate using a GP model. Then we extend these models to the multispecies setting by incorporating cross-covariances among species with a continuous time covariance structure using the linear model of coregionalization. As a case study, we examine the productivity of three Pacific salmon populations. We compare the alternative Ricker population growth functions using model posterior probabilities and leave-one-out cross validation predictive densities. Our results show substantial temporal variation in maximum reproductive rates and reveal temporal dependence among the species, which have direct management implications. However, our results do not support inclusion of semiparametric discrepancy function and they suggest that the semiparametric discrepancy functions may lead to challenges in parameter identifiability more generally.","[Hartmann, Marcelo; Vanhatalo, Jarno] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Dept Math & Stat, POB 68, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Hosack, Geoffrey R.; Hillary, Richard M.] CSIRO, Marine Labs, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Hartmann, M (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, Dept Math & Stat, POB 68, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",marcelo.hartmann@helsinki.fi; Geoff.Hosack@csiro.au; Rich.Hillary@csiro.au; jarno.vanhatalo@helsinki.fi,"Vanhatalo, Jarno/H-4435-2012; Hillary, Richard M/L-3300-2013; Hosack, Geoffrey R/E-8566-2010","Vanhatalo, Jarno/0000-0002-6831-0211; Hosack, Geoffrey R/0000-0002-6462-6817; Hartmann, Marcelo/0000-0001-6393-1687",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [304531]; University of Helsinki,Supported by Academy of Finland (Grant 304531).; Supported by University of Helsinki.,,58,5,5,0,8,INST MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS,CLEVELAND,"3163 SOMERSET DR, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",1932-6157,,,ANN APPL STAT,Ann.

Patterns of species richness often correlate strongly with measures of energy. The more individuals hypothesis (MIH) proposes that this relationship is facilitated by greater resources supporting larger populations, which are less likely to become extinct. Hence, the MIH predicts that community abundance and species richness will be positively related. 2. Recently, <link rid=b4>Buckley & Jetz (2010, Journal of Animal Ecology, 79, 358-365) documented a decoupling of community abundance and species richness in lizard communities in south-west United States, such that richer communities did not contain more individuals. They predicted, as a consequence of the mechanisms driving the decoupling, a more even distribution of species abundances in species-rich communities, evidenced by a positive relationship between species evenness and species richness. 3. We found a similar decoupling of the relationship between abundance and species richness for lizard communities in semi-arid south-eastern Australia. However, we note that a positive relationship between evenness and richness is expected because of the nature of the indices used. We illustrate this mathematically and empirically using data from both sets of lizard communities. When we used a measure of evenness, which is robust to species richness, there was no relationship between evenness and richness in either data set. 4. For lizard communities in both Australia and the United States, species dominance decreased as species richness increased. Further, with the iterative removal of the first, second and third most dominant species from each community, the relationship between abundance and species richness became increasingly more positive. 5. Our data support the contention that species richness in lizard communities is not directly related to the number of individuals an environment can support. We propose an alternative hypothesis regarding how the decoupling of abundance and richness is accommodated; namely, an inverse relationship between species dominance and species richness, possibly because of ecological release.","[Nimmo, Dale G.; Kelly, Luke T.; Watson, Simon J.; Bennett, Andrew F.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Landscape Ecol Res Grp, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [James, Simon G.] Deakin Univ, Optimizat Intelligent Modelling & Learning Res Gr, Sch Math & Informat Technol, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia","Nimmo, DG (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Landscape Ecol Res Grp, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",dgni@deakin.edu.au,"Watson, Simon/B-4232-2013","Watson, Simon/0000-0001-6063-7327; Kelly, Luke/0000-0002-3127-3111; James, Simon/0000-0003-1150-0628",,,,28,13,13,1,40,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

We measured biotic interaction strengths between an invasive and a native endemic snail species in 2 streams in the western United States. The invasive freshwater New Zealand mudsnail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, was the dominant snail in a 3(rd)-order order stream, and a closely related endemic snail, Pyrgulopsis robusta, was the dominant snail in a 1(st)-order tributary stream. We compared consumer-resource (C-R) and consumer-consumer (C-C) per biomass interaction strengths in both streams using field enclosure experiments. Consumer effects on algal resources were strong and equivalent for both snail species in both streams. Invasion success of P. antipodarum could not be attributed to an unusually high rate of resource acquisition at either site because the 2 snails exerted equivalent C-R interaction strengths. However, C-C interactions were asymmetric; the invasive snail significantly limited growth of the native snail, whereas the native snail facilitated growth of the invasive snail. These effects were stronger in the stream where P. antipodarum was dominant. Thus, per biomass interaction strengths indicated that asymmetric interactions could be contributing to patterns of dominance by invasive and endemic stream snails.","[Riley, Leslie A.; Dybdahl, Mark F.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99163 USA; [Hall, Robert O., Jr.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Riley, LA (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA 99163 USA.",leslie_riley@wsu.edu; dybdahl@wsu.edu; bhall@uwyo.edu,"Dybdahl, Mark/B-8649-2012",,"University of Wyoming/National Park Service Research Station; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 9907373, 0296049]","We thank B.

Tetranychid mites, Aponychus corpuzae Rimando, Panonychus bambusicola Ehara and Gotoh and Stigniaeopsis longus (Saito) preferred glabrous leaves, whereas Schizotetranychus recki Ehara and Yezonychus sapporensis Ehara, and the predators Agistemus summersi Ehara (Stigmaeidae) and Phytoseius tenuiformis Ehara (Phytoseiidae) preferred hirsute leaves. Species living on glabrous leaves tended to avoid species living on hirsute leaves. However, three species that prefer glabrous leaves sometimes coexisted with and sometimes avoided species that prefered hirsute leaves. Each species probably has some range of leaf hairiness that they tolerate and prefer. The presence of leaf hairs along the midvein of the lower surfaces of the leaves are especially important because they increase the acceptable range for coexistence of species preferring glabrous or hirsute leaves. Stigniaeopsis longus coexisted with Typhlodromus bainbusae Ehara, which is a species-specific predator of St. longus. Yezonychus sapporensis coexisted with Ag. summersi, which is a predator of Y. sapporensis and Sc. recki. The population density of each spider mite species produced one to three peaks in spring, autumn and/or early winter depending on the species and the census periods. Phytoseius tenuiformis accounted for most of the phytoseiid mites on Sasa leaves and occurred on the most hirsute leaves. Almost all phytoseiid mites collected in the nests of the spider mite St. longus were T bambusae. The critical photoperiods of five spider mite species ranged from 13.5 to 14.5 h at 18 degrees C, which occured between late August and mid-September in Sapporo. The dates by which 50% or more individuals entered diapause were between late August and late September, roughly corresponding with timing predicted by the critical photoperiods. The maximum number of generations that could be produced in a year was estimated as four or five based on the total degree-days accumulated above the lower temperature threshold (10.2-12.1 degrees C) of five spider mite species and the thermal constant (164.5-217.7 DD) of these mite species.","Ibaraki Univ, Fac Agr, Lab Appl Entomol & Zool, Ibaraki 3000393, Japan","Gotoh, T (corresponding author), 1-5-10 Nishi 7,Kita 21, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0010021, Japan.",gotoh@mx.ibaraki.ac.jp,,,,,,26,7,7,0,1,INDIRA PUBLISHING HOUSE,WEST BLOOMFIELD,"P O BOX 250456, WEST BLOOMFIELD, MI 48325-0456 USA",0164-7954,,,INT J ACAROL,Int.

In the model, leaf area in the canopy increases by the production of new leaves, which is proportional to the canopy photosynthetic rate, with canopy nitrogen increasing with uptake of nitrogen from soil. Then the optimal leaf area index (LAI; leaf area per ground area) that maximizes canopy photosynthesis is calculated. If leaf area is produced in excess, old leaves are eliminated with their nitrogen as dead leaves. Consequently, a new canopy having an optimal LAI and an optimal amount of nitrogen is obtained. Repeating these processes gives canopy growth. The model provides predictions of optimal LAI, canopy photosynthetic rates, leaf life span, nitrogen use efficiency, and also the responses of these factors to changes in nitrogen and light availability. Canopies are predicted to have a larger LAI and a higher canopy photosynthetic rate at a steady state under higher nutrient and/or light availabilities. Effects of species characteristics, such as photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency and leaf mass per area, are also evaluated. The model predicts many empirically observed patterns for ecophysiological traits across species.","Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan","Hikosaka, K (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan.",hikosaka@mail.cc.tohoku.ac.jp,"Hikosaka, Kouki/A-5415-2013; Hikosaka, Kouki/AAH-4214-2019","Hikosaka, Kouki/0000-0003-1744-3775; Hikosaka, Kouki/0000-0003-1744-3775",,,,71,82,88,0,39,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

This problem may be exacerbated by the fact that these studies might fail to consider the basic physiological differences that could exist between human patients and animal models. We report the development of a targeted mass spectrometry-based assay capable of monitoring >50 different kinases using peptides conserved in humans and the key preclinical species used in drug development (mouse, rat, dog, and cynomolgus monkey). These methods were then used to profile interspecies kinome variability in spleen with three of the current techniques used in targeted proteomics (MRM, PRM, and IS-PRM). IS-PRM provides the highest number of kinase identifications, and the results indicate that while this initial set of kinases exhibits high correlation between species for this tissue type, distinct species-specific differences do exist, especially within the cyclin-dependent kinase family. An initial screen in two species with the kinase inhibitor dasatinib in competition with the chemoproteomic kinase-binding probe XO44 demonstrated how the targeted methods can be further applied to study species-specific inhibitor occupancy profiles. Understanding such differences could help rationalize the findings of preclinical studies and have major implications for the selection of these animals as models in kinase drug development.","[Marholz, Laura J.; Federspiel, Joel D.; Suh, Hyunsuk; Ocana, Mireia Fernandez] Pfizer Inc, Dept Drug Safety Res & Dev, Andover, MA 01810 USA","Ocana, MF (corresponding author), Pfizer Inc, Dept Drug Safety Res & Dev, Andover, MA 01810 USA.",Mireia.FernandezOcana@pfizer.com,,"Marholz, Laura/0000-0002-9269-581X","Pfizer Worldwide Research, Development and Medical Postdoctoral program","This research has been supported by the Pfizer Worldwide Research, Development and Medical Postdoctoral program.",,64,0,0,0,0,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1535-3893,1535-3907,,J PROTEOME RES,J.

These processes provide insight into predictable landscape-level relationships between organisms and their abiotic environment in the form of regular and irregular patterns of biota and resources. However, two aspects have largely been overlooked; the roles played by plant - soil-biota feedbacks and allelopathy in spatial self-organization, and their potential contribution, along with plant-resource feedbacks, to community assembly through spatial self-organization. Here, we expand the drivers of spatial self-organization from a focus on plant-resource feedbacks to include plant - soil-biota feedbacks and allelopathy, and integrate concepts of nonlinear physics and community ecology to generate a new hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, below-ground processes can affect community assemblages through two types of spatial self-organization, global and local. The former occurs simultaneously across whole ecosystems, leading to self-organized patterns of biota, allelochemicals and resources, and niche partitioning. The latter occurs locally in ecotones, and determines ecotone structure and motion, invasion dynamics, and species coexistence. Studies of the two forms of spatial self-organization are important for understanding the organization of plant communities in drier climates which are likely to involve spatial patterning or re-patterning. Such studies are also important for developing new practices of ecosystem management, based on local manipulations at ecotones, to slow invasion dynamics or induce transitions from transitive to intransitive networks of interspecific interactions which increase species diversity.

Despite increasing reports of severe drought and heat impacts on forest ecosystems, community-level processes, which could potentially modulate tree responses to climatic stress, are rarely accounted for. While numerous studies indicate a positive effect of species diversity on a wide range of ecosystem functions and services, little is known about how species interactions influence tree responses to climatic variability. 2. We quantified the intraspecific variation in 16 leaf and wood physiological, morphological and anatomical traits in mature beech trees (Fagus sylvatica L.) at six sites located along a climatic gradient in the French Alps. At each site, we studied pure beech and mixed stands with silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) or downy oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.). We tested how functional traits differed between the two species mixtures (pure vs. mixed stands) within each site and along the climatic gradient. 3. We found significant changes in many traits along the climatic gradient as conditions progressively got drier and warmer. Independent of the mixture, reduced leaf-level CO2 assimilation, stomatal size and thicker leaf cuticles, consistent with a more conservative resource use strategy, were found. At the drier sites, higher foliar stable carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13), thicker mesophyll tissues and lower specific leaf area (SLA) in pure stands suggest that beech had more acquisitive traits there compared to mixed stands. At the wetter sites, trees in beech-silver fir mixtures had higher chlorophyll concentration, lower delta C-13, larger xylem vessels and higher SLA, suggesting a more acquisitive resource use strategy in mixed stands than in pure stands. 4. Our work revealed that species interactions are significant modulators of functional traits, and that they can be just as important drivers of intraspecific trait variation as climatic conditions. We show that downy oak mixtures lead to an adaptive drought response by common beech in dry environments. In contrast, in milder climates, interactions with silver fir seem to increase beech resource acquisition and productivity. These findings highlight a strong context dependency and imply that incorporating local interspecific interactions in research on climate impacts could improve our understanding and predictions of forest dynamics.","[Didion-Gency, Margaux; Gessler, Arthur; Vollenweider, Pierre] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape WSL, Forest Dynam Unit, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Bachofen, Christoph; Grossiord, Charlotte] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Plant Ecol Res Lab PERL, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Bachofen, Christoph; Grossiord, Charlotte] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape WSL, Community Ecol Unit, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Buchmann, Nina] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Agr Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Gessler, Arthur] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Terr Ecosyst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Morin, Xavier] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3, Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CEFEIRD,IRD,CNRS, Montpellier, France; [Vicente, Eduardo] Univ Alicante, Joint Res Unit Univ Alicante CEAM, Dept Ecol, Alicante, Spain","Didion-Gency, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape WSL, Forest Dynam Unit, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",margaux.didion@wsl.ch,"Gessler, Arthur/C-7121-2008; Vollenweider, Pierre/L-9315-2013","Gessler, Arthur/0000-0002-1910-9589; Vollenweider, Pierre/0000-0002-4995-1419; Didion-Gency, Margaux/0000-0001-8967-3655; Bachofen, Christoph/0000-0002-5269-0299; Grossiord, Charlotte/0000-0002-9113-3671",Swiss National Science Foundation SNFSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF),Swiss National Science Foundation SNF,,62,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Competitive displacement of L. sativae by L. trifolii occurred during the expansion process of the latter in southern China, while whether L. trifolii can expand their range to northern China remains unclear. Overwintering and cold tolerance capacity largely determine the species distribution range and can affect species displacement through overwintering and phenology. In this study, we compared the overwintering potential, cold tolerance and supercooling point (SCP) between these two leafminer species. Our results showed that L. trifolii can overwinter at higher altitudes than L. sativae. In addition, we found that they can both successfully overwinter in greenhouses in northern China, and the overwintering capacity of L. trifolii was higher than that of L. sativae. Moreover, the extreme low-temperature survival of L. trifolii was significantly higher than that of L. sativae, and the SCP of the former was lower than that of the latter. We thus conclude that the overwintering and cold tolerance capacity of L. trifolii is much better than that of L. sativae. Our findings indicate that L. trifolii has the potential to displace L. sativae and expand its range to northern China. Moreover, our results have important implications for predicting overwinter ranges and developing management strategies for invasive leafminers in China.","[Zhang, Qikai; Wu, Shengyong; Wang, Haihong; Lei, Zhongren] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Xing, Zhenlong] Henan Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Crop Stress Adaptat & Improvement, Kaifeng 475004, Henan, Peoples R China","Lei, ZR (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.; Xing, ZL (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Crop Stress Adaptat & Improvement, Kaifeng 475004, Henan, Peoples R China.",zxing@vip.henu.edu.cn; leizhr@sina.com,,,National Key Research & Development (RD) Plan [2017YFD0200900]; China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA [CARS-23-D-08],"Funding is provided by National Key Research & Development (R&D) Plan (Grand no. 2017YFD0200900), China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA (Grand no.

Potential post-translational modifications of SpxB were determined using coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Two mutant strains were constructed to further validate the presence of predicted site-specific post-translational modifications. These site mutated SpxB proteins exhibited reduced solubility in vivo, which likely contributes to the observed phenotypic changes in colony morphology, bacterial growth, and H2O2 production.

While interspecific interactions are recognized as main drivers of plant community patterns, intraspecific interactions have recently gained attention in explaining plant community dynamics. However, an overview of intraspecific genotype-by-genotype interaction patterns within wild plant species is still missing. From the literature, we identified 91 experiments that were mainly designed to investigate the presence of positive interactions based on two contrasting hypotheses. Kin selection theory predicts partisan help given to a genealogical relative. The rationale behind this hypothesis relies on kin/non-kin recognition, with the positive outcome of kin cooperation substantiating it. On the other hand, the elbow-room hypothesis supports intraspecific niche partitioning leading to positive outcome when genetically distant genotypes interact. Positive diversity-productivity relationship rationalizes this hypothesis, notably with the outcome of overyielding. We found that both these hypotheses have been highly supported in experimental studies despite their opposite predictions between the extent of genetic relatedness among neighbors and the level of positive interactions. Interestingly, we identified a highly significant effect of breeding system, with a high proportion of selfing species associated with the presence of kin cooperation. Nonetheless, we identified several shortcomings regardless of the species considered, such as the lack of a reliable estimate of genetic relatedness among genotypes and ecological characterization of the natural habitats from which genotypes were collected, thereby impeding the identification of selective drivers of positive interactions. We therefore propose a framework combining evolutionary ecology and genomics to establish the eco-genomic landscape of positive GxG interactions in wild plant species.","[Subrahmaniam, Harihar Jaishree; Roby, Dominique; Roux, Fabrice] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, INRAE, LIPME, Castanet Tolosan, France","Roux, F (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS, INRAE, LIPME, Castanet Tolosan, France.",fabrice.roux@inrae.fr,,,LABEX TULIP [ANR-10-LABX-41],This work was funded by a Ph.D. fellowship from the LABEX TULIP to HJS (ANR-10-LABX-41).,,156,0,0,7,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Most ecological research has focused on negative species interactions, especially competition, predation and parasitism. Yet the relevance of positive interactions - mutualisms and commensalisms - have been brought to the fore in recent years by an increasing number of empirical studies exploring their impact on range limits. Based on a review of 73 studies from a Web of Science search, we found strong evidence that positive interactions can influence the extent of species' geographic or ecological ranges through a diversity of mechanisms. More specifically, we found that while obligate interactions, and especially obligate mutualisms, tend to constrain the ranges of one or both partners, facultative positive interactions tend to widen ranges. Nonetheless, there was more variation in effects of facultative interactions on range limits, pointing to important context-dependencies. Therefore, we propose that conceptual development in this field will come from studying ecological interactions in the context of networks of many species across environmental gradients, since pairwise interactions alone might overlook the indirect and environmentally-contingent effects that species have on each other in communities of many interacting species. Finally, our study also revealed key data gaps that limit our current understanding of the pervasiveness of effects that positive interactions have on species' ranges, highlighting potential avenues for future theoretical and experimental work.","[Stephan, Pauline; Mora, Bernat Bramon; Alexander, Jake M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland","Stephan, P (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",stephanp@student.ethz.ch,"; Alexander, Jake/P-2580-2014","Stephan, Pauline/0000-0002-5218-3852; Alexander, Jake/0000-0003-2226-7913",European UnionEuropean Commission [678841],We thank Thomas Stadler and students on the course `Ecology and Evolution: Term Paper' at ETH Zurich for suggestions that helped improve an early version of this manuscript.

We tested the hypothesis that in Neotropical humid sites, reproductive activity in sympatric species will vary in the time of occurrence so that there is no complete temporal overlap. We also investigated whether the length of the breeding season was associated to relative testes size as a proxy for male-male competition. We inferred reproductive phenology from seasonal variation in the number of sexually active individuals, their gonad developmental stage, and male vocal activity from January 2003 to March 2004. Our data do not support the hypothesis of temporal segregation in reproduction for this assemblage because we found a prolonged reproductive pattern in the five species, but there was decreased breeding intensity in the cooler months (November-February). This deduction is supported by a drop in the weight of the ovaries and the number of vitellogenic follicles, absence of mature females or reduction of their abundance, and disappearance of male vocal activity in the winter. We found differences in relative testes size among species, which were not related to differences in the length of the breeding season, but rather to interspecific differences in sex ratio.","[Bignotte-Giro, Irelis; Fong, Ansel G.] Museo Hist Nat Tomas Romay, Ctr Oriental Ecosistemas & Biodiversidad BIOECO, Santiago De Cuba 90100, Cuba; [Lopez-Iborra, German M.] Univ Alicante, Dept Ecol IMEM Ramon Margalef, Apdo Correos 99, Alicante 03080, Spain; [Ramirez-Pinilla, Martha P.] Univ Ind Santander, Lab Biol Reprod Vertebrados, Bucaramanga 68001000, Colombia","Bignotte-Giro, I (corresponding author), Museo Hist Nat Tomas Romay, Ctr Oriental Ecosistemas & Biodiversidad BIOECO, Santiago De Cuba 90100, Cuba.",irelis@bioeco.cu,,,Declining Amphibian Population Task Force; Universidad de Alicante,"We thank R.

Through a pioneer study in North-West Africa based on a camera-trapping survey, we studied ecology features of a carnivores' community in the Middle Atlas Mountains, Morocco. We focused on how species shared (or not) the territory and their activity patterns. Camera trapping detected five carnivorous species: African golden wolf (Canis lupaster), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), genet (Genetta genetta) and African wildcat (Felis lybica lybica). Generalized Linear Models confirmed different habitat selection patterns between these species. The presence of a small protected area or prey availability apparently were not determinant factors in the abundance of these species. Spatial segregation patterns were observed between the red fox with the domestic dog and between the red fox with the genet. Kernel density estimates showed strong temporal segregation of red fox and African golden wolf with regard to domestic dog, and suggested avoidance mechanisms for the triad red fox, genet and African golden wolf. Despite the influence of interspecific competition in the assembly of the community, human pressure was apparently the most relevant factor related with the spatiotemporal segregation in this territory.","[Gil-Sanchez, Jose Maria; Mana-Varela, Brais] Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Avda Fuente Nueva S-N, Granada 18071, Spain; [Herrera-Sanchez, F.

We studied the natural history, activity, and microhabitat use of Turner?s Thick-toed Gecko (Chondrodactylus turneri) and the Common Namib Day Gecko (Rhoptropus afer) in the Namib Desert. Both species were associated with the same rocky habitat but exhibited differences in activity (i.e., times of day when visible out of crevices) and microhabitat use (i.e., characteristics of rocks occupied). Two 48-hr surveys revealed peaks of activity starting at 2000 h for C. turneri and 1000 h for R. afer. To evaluate microhabitat use, we measured rock characteristics, quantifying rock dimensions and counting the number of small loose rocks. In addition, we counted and categorized crevices, and determined the temperature of some crevices over a 3-day period. Rock height was positively correlated to C. turneri presence, whereas rock width and length were positively associated with R. afer presence. Availability of loose rocks and medium-sized crevices were also strong predictors for R. afer occupancy. Crevices occupied by R. afer were warmer than those occupied by C. turneri. Stability in this desert lizard community is based on occupancy of different areas of the rocks (microhabitat variation) at different peak times (activity variation).","[Hedman, Hayden D.] Univ Illinois, Prairie Res Inst, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Chuga, Sililo C.] Namibian Univ Sci & Technol, 13 Storch St, Windhoek, Namibia; [Eifler, Douglas A.; Eifler, Maria A.] Erell Inst, 2808 Meadow Dr, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; [Hanghome, Gustaf P.

This study investigates breeding biology of an emblematic species of this region: The Ferruginous Duck (Aythya nyroca), a duck ranked globally 'Near Threatened' on the IUCN Red List. This study aimed to determine wetland environmental variables influencing nest site selection and breeding success of the species. Over two successive breeding seasons (2016 and 2017), the effects of habitat characteristics and nest traits on breeding parameters of 50 nests constructed on alder carr of the lake and offshore floating vegetation islets in the center of the waterbody were analyzed using generalized linear models (GLM). Clutch size averaged 9.8 +/- 0.7 eggs (range: 2-26 eggs) with 66% hatching success. Desertion of the nest (i.e. nest abandonment by the parents during the period of egg-laying and/or incubation) was the main cause for breeding failure (18% of total nests). Clutch size was positively related to nest surface and nest depth, but it decreased with the increase in the distance of nest on the vegetation platform to water. GLM revealed that breeding success was positively associated with late clutches; with a negative effect of conspecific nest density on clutch size and breeding success. Nest-site choice is resulted from interspecific competition and/or is affected by the reduced number of favorable nesting sites. Nine nests (18%) were parasitized by the same species of which 67% were central nests. Only 2% of the nests studied were parasitized by Oxyura leucocephala nesting at the site. Possible explanations of nest site selection of Aythya nyroca in the study area are discussed. Variations in selection pressures may explain the relationships between the choice and characteristics of nest site in the Ferruginous duck at Lake Tonga. (c) 2021 The Authors.

In mammals, the emerging picture is that the metabolic state and immune system status of the host affect the composition of the microbiome, but quantitative ecological microbiome studies are challenging to perform in higher organisms. Here, we show that these phenomena can be quantitatively analyzed in the tractable nematode host Caenorhabditis elegans. Mutants in innate immunity, in particular the DAF-2/insulin growth factor (IGF) pathway, are shown to contain a microbiome that differs from that of wild-type nematodes. We analyzed the underlying basis of these differences from the perspective of community ecology by comparing experimental observations to the predictions of a neutral sampling model and concluded that fundamental differences in microbiome ecology underlie the observed differences in microbiome composition. We tested this hypothesis by introducing a minor perturbation into the colonization conditions, allowing us to assess stability of communities in different host strains. Our results show that altering host immunity changes the importance of interspecies interactions within the microbiome, resulting in differences in community composition and stability that emerge from these differences in host-microbe ecology. IMPORTANCE Here, we used a Caenorhabditis elegans microbiome model to demonstrate how genetic differences in innate immunity alter microbiome composition, diversity, and stability by changing the ecological processes that shape these communities. These results provide insight into the role of host genetics in controlling the ecology of the host-associated microbiota, resulting in differences in community composition, successional trajectories, and response to perturbation.","[Taylor, Megan; Vega, N.

In temperate forests, fine-scale environmental variation may promote local coexistence among herbaceous species by allowing plants to spatially partition microsites within forest stands. Here we argue that shallow soils, low soil water-holding capacity and fertility, and reduced light near tree boles should favor short, shallow-rooted, evergreen species like Anemone acutiloba with low moisture, nutrient, and light requirements. Farther from trees, richer, deeper soils should favor taller, deeper-rooted herbs with greater moisture and nutrient demands, such as Sanguinaria canadensis and Trillium flexipes. METHODS: We tested these hypotheses by mapping the fine-scale distributions of Anemone, Sanguinaria, and Trillium individuals within a 50 x 50 m plot, comparing local species' distributions with respect to soil depth and proximity to neighboring trees, and characterizing intraspecific and interspecific spatial associations. RESULTS: Local plant distributions were consistent with our predictions based on leaf height, physiology, and phenology. Anemone was found in microsites on shallower soils and closer to trees than either Sanguinaria or Trillium. In all three species, individual plants were spatially aggregated within 2 m, but spatially segregated from individuals of the other species beyond 2 m. CONCLUSIONS: Differential plant responses to fine-scale environmental heterogeneity and observed spatial associations suggest that local species-environment associations could facilitate coexistence. These findings illustrate how fine-scale environmental heterogeneity coupled with phenological and physiological differences likely contribute to spatial niche partitioning among spring-flowering forest herbs and maintain high local plant diversity within temperate forests.","[Beck, Jared J.; Givnish, Thomas J.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot, 430 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Beck, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot, 430 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jared.j.beck@gmail.com,,"Givnish, Thomas/0000-0003-3166-4566","Davis Grant from the UW Madison Botany Department; UW-Madison Arboretum; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1747503, DEB-1557096]; Graduate School at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation","This research was supported by a Davis Grant from the UW Madison Botany Department and a Graduate Research Fellowship from the UW-Madison Arboretum to J.J.B.

The structure of interaction networks can be nested and/or modular. Ecologically, the nested structure minimizes competition and increases the number of coexisting species, creating high diversity, while the modular structure occurs when there are non-overlapping groups of highly interacting consumer-resource species. Despite the importance of gastropod shells to hermit crabs, currently, few studies explored the structure of hermit crabs communities through a resource-usage perspective. Therefore, network analyses appear as an important tool to unveil how the use of empty shell as a resource rules hermit crabs communities through competition among species and rules hermit crabs populations through competition among distinct ontogenetic groups. This study investigated the resource usage pattern of empty gastropod shells by distinct ontogenetic stages of the hermit crab Calcinus tibicen from two different locations, using a network approach and the Shell Adequacy Index (SAI) analysis. The present results show that the interaction network between ontogenetic groups and gastropod shells was non-nested and modular and the SAI reflected the differences between males and ovigerous females in both locations, regarding shell size adequacy. We suggest that the modular structure may be a result of resource partitioning, which, in turn, is favored in habitats with a high degree of heterogeneity. The modular network structure may indicate habitat heterogeneity and resource partitioning. Future studies including other hermit crab species from the same areas should help determine how shells are partitioned interspecifically.","[Santos, Mateus Pereira; Rodrigues, Gabriel Fellipe Barros; Negreiros-Fransozo, Maria Lucia] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, NEBECC Study Grp Crustacean Biol Ecol & Culture, Inst Biosci, Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Santos, Mateus Pereira; Rodrigues, Gabriel Fellipe Barros; Negreiros-Fransozo, Maria Lucia] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Inst Biosci, Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Fransozo, Vivian] State Univ Southeastern Bahia UESB, Dept Nat Sci, Vitoria Da Conquista Campus, Vitoria Da Conquista, BA, Brazil","Santos, MP (corresponding author), Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, NEBECC Study Grp Crustacean Biol Ecol & Culture, Inst Biosci, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.",mateus-pereira.santos@unesp.br,"Santos, Mateus/AAD-1191-2021; Rodrigues, Gabriel/AAP-9575-2021; Negreiros-Fransozo, Maria/H-2403-2012","Rodrigues, Gabriel/0000-0002-1679-9270; Negreiros-Fransozo, Maria/0000-0002-8070-8089",State University of the Southeastern of Bahia (UESB),The State University of the Southeastern of Bahia (UESB) has supported the present study.,,89,0,0,3,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,1573-5125,,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

Nine parameters significantly discriminated interspecies differences (Meriones meridianus occurred in dry microhabitats, Meriones tamariscinus occurred in wetter microhabitats, and Apodemus witherbyi and Cricetulus migratorius showed eurybiotic spatial patterns). Mus musculus was predominantly found in wet environmental conditions. Thus, A. witherbyi and C. migratorius were characterized by the greatest range of spatial niches in the community, and M. musculus was characterized by the narrowest range of spatial niches.

We also describe an experiment, using tortoise shells, that can allow to control, and eventually correct, the reliability of observed data by taking into account the detectability of the study species in the wild. On the basis of a suite of statistical analysis and GIS-based elaborations, we confirmed, and further uncovered, the remarkable ecological differences existing between S. pardalis and K. belliana. The habitat use was different interspecifically, with K. belliana being much more linked to dense vegetation spots, often nearby waterbodies, whereas S. pardalis being an habitat generalist, at both micro- and macmhabitat scale. Nonetheless, juveniles of both species were observed in areas with significantly higher % soil covered by vegetation taller than 200 cm than adults of both sexes. This different habitat selection is hypothesized to be due to antipredatory reasons.

A few species across bee families have evolved nocturnality, displaying remarkable adaptations to overcome limitations of their daylight-suited apposition eyes. Phase inversion to nocturnality in a minority of bees that co-exist with diurnal bees provides a unique opportunity to study ecological benefits that mediate total temporal niche shifts. While floral traits and sensory modalities associated with the evolution of classical nocturnal pollination syndromes, e.g. by bats and moths, are well-studied, nocturnality in bees represents a poorly understood, recently invaded, extreme niche. To test the competitive release hypothesis, we examine how nocturnality shapes foraging by comparing pollen loads, nest pollen, and flower visitation of sympatric nocturnal and diurnal carpenter bees. We predicted that nocturnal bees primarily use night-blooming flowers, show little/no resource overlap with diurnal species and competitive release favors night-time pollen collection for provisioning. Contrarily, we found substantial resource overlap between nocturnal and diurnal bees. Flower opening times, floral longevity and plant abundance did not define nocturnal flower use. Smaller pollen loads on nocturnal foragers suggest subsistence on resource leftovers largely from diurnal flowers. Greater pollen types/diversity on nocturnal foragers indicate lower floral constancy compared to diurnal congenerics. Reduced activity during new moon compared to full moon suggests constraints to nocturnal foraging. Invasion and sustenance within the nocturnal niche is characterized by: (i) opportunistic foraging on residual resources as indicated by smaller pollen loads, extensive utilization of day-blooming flowers and substantial overlap with diurnal bees, (ii) generalization at two levels-between and within foraging trips as indicated by lower floral constancy, (iii) reduced foraging on darker nights, indicating visual constraints despite sensitive optics. This together with smaller populations and univoltine breeding in nocturnal compared to multivoltine diurnal counterparts suggest that nocturnality imposes substantial fitness costs. In conclusion, the evolution of nocturnality in bees is accompanied by resource generalization instead of specialization. Reduced floral constancy suggests differences in foraging strategies of nocturnal and diurnal bees which merits further investigation. The relative roles of competition, floral rewards and predators should be examined to fully understand the evolution and maintenance of nocturnality in bees.","[Somanathan, Hema; Krishna, Shivani; Jos, Elsa M.] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res, Sch Biol, IISER TVM Ctr Res & Educ Ecol & Evolut ICREEE, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India; [Krishna, Shivani] Ashoka Univ, Dept Biol, Sonepat, India; [Gowda, Vishwas; Borges, Renee M.] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bengaluru, India; [Kelber, Almut] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Lund, Sweden; [Jos, Elsa M.] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Gowda, Vishwas] Univ Arizona, Dept Neurosci, Tucson, AZ USA","Somanathan, H (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res, Sch Biol, IISER TVM Ctr Res & Educ Ecol & Evolut ICREEE, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.",hsomanathan@iisertvm.ac.in,"Kelber, Almut/H-6216-2014","Kelber, Almut/0000-0003-3937-2808",Swedish International Development Agency; Wenner-Gren foundation; IISER Thiruvananthapuram,"We thank Kalu Kurade, Ganpat Lohkare, and Subhash Vangere for field assistance and the Maharashtra Forest Department for permissions.

Microorganisms are known to be transmitted during mating, especially when mating with multiple partners, and factors reducing this cost of multiple mating are expected. Further, plumage brightness and colour intensity have been shown to be important traits to benefits from multiple mating as predicted by sexual selection. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the rate of extra-pair paternity and the relative size of the uropygial gland at the interspecific level, as the uropygial gland is an exocrine gland hypothesized to produce antiparasitic substances and further identified to affect plumage brightness. Because of the expected benefits of large uropygial gland in scenarios of sexual selection, we predicted a positive correlation with EPP. Methods We collected information from the literature of uropygial gland size and frequency of extra-pair paternity of 60 avian species of different families and explored the predicted positive correlation between them. We did so with means of comparative analyses that considered phylogenetic relationship as random factor and included body mass as covariate. We used Markov chain Monte Carlo generalized linear mixed models that were weighted by number of nests used to estimate extra-pair paternity. Results We detected a positive relationship between level of extra-pair paternity and uropygial gland size at an interspecific level. This finding is consistent with the prediction. Conclusions We discuss the importance of this result in scenarios of sexual selection and argue that the detected relationship may have arisen by utilizing antiparasitic secretions through secondary sexual characters indicating parasite resistance.","[Moller, Anders Pape] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Moller, Anders Pape] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, Ecol Systemat & Evolut, AgroParisTech, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Soraker, Jorgen Skavdal] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Hgsk Ringen 5, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Soler, Juan Jose] Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, Ctra Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain","Moller, AP (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biodivers Sci & Ecol Engn, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.; Moller, AP (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, Ecol Systemat & Evolut, AgroParisTech, F-91405 Orsay, France.",anders.moller@u-psud.fr,"Soler, J.

Despite its relevance in the research field, little is known about the ontogeny and inter-population effects on the otolith of freshwater fish. In this study we used otoliths from 1800 European perch (Perca fluviatilis) individuals from 9 different populations to analyze the ontogenetic and inter-population differences on the otolith shape using six morphometric indices. The relationship between fish and otolith length was fitted using three different regression models (linear, power and logistic) to identify the best allometric relationship. Our results show that there are strong ontogenetic and interpopulation differences in P. fluviatilis otolith shapes. We also show that the relationship between the fish and otolith length follows a logistic curve. The ontogenetic differences on otolith shape might be related to extrinsic factors (diet shift and intra and interspecific competition) in each ecosystem, given that the reservoirs are different and no clear pattern on the otolith shapes can be distinguished among populations. Our results imply that the available back-calculation models may not always provide accurate estimates of P. fluviatilis length and that a model that takes into account the real allometric relationship for the species can improve the fish length estimations of back-calculated fish lengths for the European perch.","[Souza, A.

As a substrate-specializing, obligate epizoic alga,Pseudocladophora conchopheriaoccupied wider micro-niches on the host of different sizes than facultative epizoic algae (encrusting rhodophytes, crustoseCorallinaandGelidium). WhilePseudocladophorademonstrated uniform use of all shell microhabitats on hosts of all sizes, crustoseCorallinaandGelidiumshowed more varied microhabitat use with shifting positions on hosts of different sizes. Furthermore, in addition to slight differences in microhabitat use, crustoseCorallinaandGelidiumdemonstrated differences in their interspecific relationship withPseudocladophora. Our generalized linear models (GLM) analyses indicated that the occurrence/abundance of crustoseCorallinawas negatively affected byPseudocladophorabut that ofGelidiumwas positively affected, whilePseudocladophoraappeared to be competitively inferior to both rhodophytes when they co-occurred on hosts of relatively large sizes. The present study, therefore, points to variable niche partitioning among algae even on a small spatial scale, which may result from complex interactions between spatio-temporal substrate heterogeneity on a live host and interspecific interactions.","[Osawa, Yumiko; Tokeshi, Mutsunori] Kyushu Univ, Amakusa Marine Biol Lab, Kumamoto, Japan","Osawa, Y (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Amakusa Marine Biol Lab, Reiho Ku, Kumamoto 8632507, Japan.",yumosa@ambl-ku.jp,,,Tokyo Institute of Technology [28-148]; Japan Science Society [28-750],"Tokyo Institute of Technology, Grant/Award Number: Research grant (No. 28-148); Japan Science Society, Grant/Award Number: Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant (No. 28-750)",,57,0,0,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

Here, we combined GPS-tracking, stable isotope analysis and DNA metabarcoding analysis to understand how the rare Tahiti petrel Pseudobulweria rostrata (TP) copes with the very abundant (i.e. 500,000 breeding pairs) wedge-tailed shearwater Ardenna pacifica (WTS) when breeding in sympatry in a tropical area. WTS foraged in restricted areas along their path, while TP predominantly foraged using extensive search behavior, suggesting a more opportunistic foraging strategy. Interspecific overlap of foraging areas was higher than intraspecific overlap. Breeding seasons largely overlap between species during the study, but TP seems to be asynchronous breeders. TP fed upon prey with higher delta N-15 values than WTS, and their diet was mainly composed of deep-sea organisms. TP could feed upon dead prey floating at the surface while WTS preyed mainly upon fish species that generally move in schools. Our study highlights several segregating mechanisms (temporal, behavioral and trophic) that could facilitate the coexistence of the two species despite the predominant number of WTS, and provides the very first information on the foraging and trophic ecology of the poorly-known TP.","[Ravache, Andreas; Pagenaud, Angelique; Vidal, Eric] Univ Nouvelle Caledonie, Univ La Reunion, Ctr IRD Noumea, CNRS,UMR ENTROPIE,IRD,Ifremer, BP A5, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Ravache, Andreas; Bourgeois, Karen; Pagenaud, Angelique; Dromzee, Sylvain] Avignon Univ, Ctr IRD Noumea, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS,IMBE,IRD, BP A5, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Weimerskirch, Henri; de Grissac, Sophie] Ctr Etud Biol Chize CNRS, Villiers En Bois, France; [Miller, Mark] Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Lorrain, Anne] Univ Brest, CNRS, IRD, Ifremer,LEMAR, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Allain, Valerie] Pacific Community SPC, BP D5, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Bustamante, Paco] La Rochelle Univ, Littoral Environm & Soc LIENSs, CNRS, UMR 7266, 2 Rue Olympe Gouges, F-17000 La Rochelle, France; [Bustamante, Paco] Inst Univ France IUF, 1 Rue Descartes, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bylemans, Jonas; Gleeson, Dianne] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Bruce, ACT, Australia; [Bylemans, Jonas] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Biophore, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Letourneur, Yves] Univ La Nouvelle Caledonie, Univ La Reunuion, CNRS, UMR ENTROPIE IRD,Ifremer, BP R4, Noumea 98851, New Caledonia","Ravache, A (corresponding author), Univ Nouvelle Caledonie, Univ La Reunion, Ctr IRD Noumea, CNRS,UMR ENTROPIE,IRD,Ifremer, BP A5, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia.; Ravache, A (corresponding author), Avignon Univ, Ctr IRD Noumea, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS,IMBE,IRD, BP A5, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia.",andreas.ravache@ird.fr,"LETOURNEUR, Yves/B-4387-2012; ravache, andreas/AAN-1196-2020; Lorrain, Anne/A-4152-2009; Bustamante, Paco/G-5833-2011; Allain, Valerie/AAE-1449-2019","LETOURNEUR, Yves/0000-0003-3157-1976; ravache, andreas/0000-0001-5413-3149; Lorrain, Anne/0000-0002-1289-2072; Bustamante, Paco/0000-0003-3877-9390; Allain, Valerie/0000-0002-9874-3077; Bourgeois, Karen/0000-0003-1195-1015",European Union BEST 2.0 project Biopelagos [1070-2015]; Province Nord [15C493]; DAFE-NC [2019/DAFE/873]; CPER (Contrat de Projet Etat-Region); FEDER (Fonds Europeen de Developpement Regional)European Commission; IUF (Institut Universitaire de France),"This study was mainly supported by the European Union BEST 2.0 project Biopelagos (Grant Number 1070-2015 to SPC), the Province Nord (Grant Number 15C493) and the DAFE-NC (Grant Number 2019/DAFE/873), while the Ecole Doctorale du Pacifique and Universite de la Nouvelle-Caledonie provided A.R. with a PhD fellowship.

Communicating by surface-borne vibrations is likely the most ancient mode of getting and exchanging information in both invertebrates and vertebrates. In this review, we concentrate on the use of vibrational communication in arthropods as a form of intraspecific and interspecific signaling, with a focus on the newest discoveries from our research group in terrestrial isopods (Crustacea: Isopoda: Oniscidea), a taxon never investigated before in this context. After getting little attention in the past, biotremology is now an emerging field of study in animal communication, and it is receiving increased interest from the scientific community dealing with these behavioral processes. In what follows, we illustrate the general principles and mechanisms on which biotremology is based, using definitions, examples, and insights from the literature in arthropods. Vibrational communication in arthropods has mainly been studied in insects and arachnids. For these taxa, much evidence of its use as a source of information from the surrounding environment exists, as well as its involvement in many behavioral roles, such as courtship and mating, conspecific recognition, competition, foraging, parental care, and danger perception. Recently, and for the first time, communication through surface-borne waves has been studied in terrestrial isopods, using a common Mediterranean species of the Armadillidae family as a pilot species, Armadillo officinalis Dumeril,1816, InDictionnaire des Sciences naturelles(pp. 115-117). Mainly, for this species, we describe typical behavioral processes, such as turn alternation, aggregation, and stridulation, where vibrational communication appears to be involved.","[Cividini, Sofia] Univ Liverpool, Inst Translat Med, Dept Biostat, Crown St, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Montesanto, Giuseppe] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Biol, Pisa, Italy","Cividini, S (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Inst Translat Med, Dept Biostat, Crown St, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.",Sofia.Cividini@liverpool.ac.uk,"Cividini, Sofia/H-9942-2017; Cividini, Sofia/E-4048-2019; Montesanto, Giuseppe/D-3011-2009","Cividini, Sofia/0000-0003-2705-9224; Montesanto, Giuseppe/0000-0001-8946-1185",,,,160,2,2,3,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1543-4494,1543-4508,,LEARN BEHAV,Learn Behav.,SEP,2020,48,3,,,,,281,300,,10.3758/s13420-020-00428-3,,JUL 2020,20,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Psychology, Experimental; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,NK0HU,WOS:000545916500002,32632754,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2021-09-21,

In fungal communities, measuring interspecific interactions directly is challenging because these communities are composed of large numbers of species, many of which are unculturable. An indirect way of assessing the role of interspecific interactions in determining community structure is to identify the species co-occurrences that are not constrained by environmental conditions. In this study, we investigated co-occurrences among root-associated fungi, asking whether fungi co-occur more or less strongly than expected based on the environmental conditions and the host plant species examined. We generated molecular data on root-associated fungi of five plant species evenly sampled along an elevational gradient at a high arctic site. We analysed the data using a joint species distribution modelling approach that allowed us to identify those co-occurrences that could be explained by the environmental conditions and the host plant species, as well as those co-occurrences that remained unexplained and thus more probably reflect interactive associations. Our results indicate that not only negative but also positive interactions play an important role in shaping microbial communities in arctic plant roots. In particular, we found that mycorrhizal fungi are especially prone to positively co-occur with other fungal species. Our results bring new understanding to the structure of arctic interaction networks by suggesting that interactions among root-associated fungi are predominantly positive.","[Abrego, Nerea; Roslin, Tomas; Huotari, Tea] Univ Helsinki, Dept Agr Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Roslin, Tomas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Tack, Ayco J.

Despite examples of invasive populations harboring lower diversity than conspecific populations in their native range, few studies have linked this lower diversity to a decrease in fitness. Using genome sequences, we show that invasive populations of the African fig fly, Zaprionus indianus, have less genetic diversity than conspecific populations in their native range and that diversity is proportionally lower in regions of the genome experiencing low recombination rates. This result suggests that selection may have played a role in lowering diversity in the invasive populations. We next use interspecific comparisons to show that genetic diversity remains relatively high in invasive populations of Z. indianus when compared with other closely related species. By comparing genetic diversity in orthologous gene regions, we also show that the genome-wide landscape of genetic diversity differs between invasive and native populations of Z. indianus indicating that invasion not only affects amounts of genetic diversity but also how that diversity is distributed across the genome. Finally, we use parameter estimates from thermal performance curves for 13 species of Zaprionus to show that Z. indianus has the broadest thermal niche of measured species, and that performance does not differ between invasive and native populations. These results illustrate how aspects of genetic diversity in invasive species can be decoupled from measures of fitness, and that a broad thermal niche may have helped facilitate Z. indianus's range expansion.","[Comeault, Aaron A.] Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Wang, Jeremy] Univ N Carolina, Dept Genet, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Tittes, Silas] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Isbell, Kristin; Hurlbert, Allen H.; Matute, Daniel R.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Ingley, Spencer] Brigham Young Univ, Fac Sci, Laie, HI USA","Comeault, AA (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales.",a.comeault@bangor.ac.uk,,"Comeault, Aaron/0000-0003-3954-2416; Hurlbert, Allen/0000-0002-5678-9907",National Science Foundation (Dimensions of Biodiversity Award) [1737752],"We thank M.

Individuals can show several behavioral responses to reduce competition for habitat, yet the mechanisms that drive them are poorly understood. This is particularly true for large carnivores, whose fine-scale monitoring is logistically complex and expensive. In Scandinavia, the home-range establishment and kill rates of gray wolves (Canis lupus) are affected by the coexistence with brown bears (Ursus arctos). Here, we applied resource selection functions and a multivariate approach to compare wolf habitat selection within home ranges of wolves that were either sympatric or allopatric with bears. Wolves selected for lower altitudes in winter, particularly in the area where bears and wolves are sympatric, where altitude is generally higher than where they are allopatric. Wolves may follow the winter migration of their staple prey, moose (Alces alces), to lower altitudes. Otherwise, we did not find any effect of bear presence on wolf habitat selection, in contrast with our previous studies. Our new results indicate that the manifestation of a specific driver of habitat selection, namely interspecific competition, can vary at different spatial-temporal scales. This is important to understand the structure of ecological communities and the varying mechanisms underlying interspecific interactions.","[Ordiz, Andres; Zimmermann, Barbara; Wabakken, Petter] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Fac Appl Ecol Agr Sci & Biotechnol, NO-2480 Evenstad, Koppang, Norway; [Ordiz, Andres; Milleret, Cyril; Swenson, Jon E.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Ordiz, Andres; Uzal, Antonio] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Anim Rural & Environm Sci, Southwell NG25 0FQ, Notts, England; [Sanz-Perez, Ana] Forest Sci & Technol Ctr Catalonia CTFC, Biodivers & Anim Conservat Lab, Solsona 25280, Spain; [Wikenros, Camilla; Sand, Hakan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Kindberg, Jonas] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, NO-7485 Trondheim, Norway; [Kindberg, Jonas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden","Ordiz, A (corresponding author), Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Fac Appl Ecol Agr Sci & Biotechnol, NO-2480 Evenstad, Koppang, Norway.; Ordiz, A (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.; Ordiz, A (corresponding author), Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Anim Rural & Environm Sci, Southwell NG25 0FQ, Notts, England.",andres.ordiz@gmail.com,"Uzal, Antonio/ABE-3885-2020; Kindberg, Jonas/AAA-5058-2020; Swenson, Jon/AAE-2890-2019; Milleret, Cyril/AAW-2388-2021","Uzal, Antonio/0000-0001-6478-1895; Kindberg, Jonas/0000-0003-1445-4524; Zimmermann, Barbara/0000-0001-5133-9379; Ordiz, Andres/0000-0002-6141-8457",Norwegian Environment Agency; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission; Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas; Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF); Norwegian Institute for Nature ResearchBioforsk; Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Office of Environmental Affairs in Hedmark County; Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management; WWF (Sweden); Swedish Carnivore Association; Olle Engkvists Foundation; Carl Tryggers Foundation; MarieClaire Cronstedts Foundation; Signhild Engkvists Foundation,"We are grateful to everyone monitoring wolves and bears in Scandinavia for several decades, including the teams that captured and handled the animals.

This systematic review summarized the endpoints and biochemical markers generated fromin vitromodels, organism-based models, human studies andin silicotools and how they are used to translate the data for risk assessment of neurotoxic chemicals. Increased evidence about different biomarkers through genomics and proteomics has developed data related to genes and proteins facilitating some understanding about the molecular mechanism of neurotoxicity. Fluid-based biomarkers such as those found in serum, plasma and urine from human studies act as indirect endpoints for neurotoxicity. Meanwhile, with improvement in knowledge of molecular mechanisms and different biomarkers, there is a potential to develop a translational platform that can integrate the biological data from different studies mechanistically and thereby translated across intra and interspecies for neurotoxicity assessment. Further, this review proposed an integrative translational framework combining experimental andin silicostudies like toxicokinetic models and integrative systems biology to assess the chemicals for neurotoxicity. This framework can be used to predict the inherent risk of neurotoxicity and extend to such chemicals where less experimental data exists.","[Deepika, Deepika; Sharma, Raju Prasad; Schuhmacher, Marta; Kumar, Vikas] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Engn Quim, Environm Engn Lab, Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain; [Kumar, Vikas] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Hosp Univ St Joan de Reus, IISPV, Reus, Spain","Kumar, V (corresponding author), Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Engn Quim, Environm Engn Lab, Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain.",vikas.kumar@urv.cat,"Schuhmacher, Marta/F-4902-2017; Sharma, Raju Prasad/F-4481-2017; Kumar, Vikas/M-2306-2014","Schuhmacher, Marta/0000-0003-4381-2490; DEEPIKA, DEEPIKA/0000-0001-8345-1349; Sharma, Raju Prasad/0000-0001-9103-9127; Kumar, Vikas/0000-0002-9795-5967",Marie Sklodowska-Curie Neurosome Project [766251]; Health Department of Catalonia Government trough Pla Estrategic de Recerca i Innovacio en salut (PERIS 2016-2020),"This study was financially supported by Marie Sklodowska-Curie Neurosome Project under the grant agreement No. 766251.

However, after an initial period of hybridization, reproductive isolation can evolve through different processes and lead to the interruption of gene flow and the completion of the speciation process. Omocestus minutissimus and O. uhagonii are two closely related grasshoppers with partially overlapping distributions in the Central System mountains of the Iberian Peninsula. To analyse spatial patterns of historical and/or contemporary hybridization between these two taxa and understand how species boundaries are maintained in the region of secondary contact, we sampled sympatric and allopatric populations of the two species and obtained genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data using a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing approach. We used Bayesian clustering analyses to test the hypothesis of contemporary hybridization in sympatric populations and employed a suite of phylogenomic approaches and a coalescent-based simulation framework to evaluate alternative hypothetical scenarios of interspecific gene flow. Our analyses rejected the hypothesis of contemporary hybridization but revealed past introgression in the area where the distributions of the two species overlap. Overall, these results point to a scenario of historical gene flow after secondary contact followed by the evolution of reproductive isolation that currently prevents hybridization among sympatric populations.","[Tonzo, Vanina; Ortego, Joaquin] Estn Biol Donana EBD CSIC, Dept Integrat Ecol, Seville, Spain; [Papadopoulou, Anna] Univ Cyprus, Dept Biol Sci, Nicosia, Cyprus","Tonzo, V (corresponding author), EBD CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Avda Americo Vespucio 26, E-41092 Seville, Spain.",vaninatonzo@gmail.com,"Tonzo, Vanina/AAA-3201-2021; Ortego, Joaquin/F-4936-2010","Tonzo, Vanina/0000-0002-5062-1070; Ortego, Joaquin/0000-0003-2709-429X","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)European Commission [CGL2014-54671-P, CGL201783433-P]; FPI Predoctoral FellowshipNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [BES-2015-73159]; Ramon y CajalSpanish Government [RYC-2013-12501]; Severo Ochoa [SEV-20120262]","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Grant/Award Number: CGL2014-54671-P and CGL201783433-P; FPI Predoctoral Fellowship, Grant/Award Number: BES-2015-73159; Severo Ochoa, Grant/Award Number: SEV-20120262; Ramon y Cajal, Grant/Award Number: RYC-2013-12501",,106,0,0,3,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1083,1365-294X,,MOL ECOL,Mol.

However, inference on behavioral mechanisms are usually lacking. We present an analysis that combines previously published spatial co-occurrence estimates and temporal kernel density estimates to explore spatiotemporal interspecific interactions. We do so by deriving a spatiotemporal value (STV) that is a relative measure of potential interaction in both niche dimensions, across a gradient of degradation, for rainforest carnivore pairs in Madagascar. We also use a conceptual framework to provide insight into the potential behavioral mechanisms of habitat selection. Of the six native and three invasive carnivores, we estimate the spatiotemporal interactions for twelve pairings, which range from no spatial/temporal relationship (n = 5) to spatiotemporal aggregation or segregation (n = 7). We visualized these spatiotemporal interactions along a fragmentation gradient and demonstrate that these interactions are not static, as STV overlap increases with increasing anthropogenic disturbance. Of the three invasive carnivores (free-ranging dogs Canis familiaris, cats Felis species, and small Indian civets Viverricula indica) the latter had the highest number of spatial occurrence (n = 4) and spatiotemporal overlap (n = 4) relationships with native carnivores. Our results highlight the potential for increasing direct and indirect interactions between native and invasive species as forest degradation and invasive predators increase. Our approach allows us to better understand adaptive behaviors, plasticity in temporal activity, community assemblage, and to develop targeted conservation strategies to manage ecological communities in rapidly changing ecosystems.","[Farris, Zach J.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Hlth & Exercise Sci, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Gerber, Brian D.; Wampole, Erin] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Karpanty, Sarah; Kelly, Marcella J.] Virginia Tech, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Murphy, Asia] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Murphy, Asia] Penn State Univ, Huck Inst Life Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Ratelolahy, Felix] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Madagascar Program, Antananarivo, Madagascar","Farris, ZJ (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Dept Hlth & Exercise Sci, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",farriszj@appstate.edu,"Farris, Zach J./AAW-6579-2020; Kelly, Marcella J/B-4891-2011","Karpanty, Sarah/0000-0003-3831-8914",,,,64,5,6,4,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

The abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes and bacteria in the gut microbiome may provide the ideal platform for plasmid exchange. Systematic data on in vivo horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and its frequency are scarce. Materials and methods: One hundred and ninety-six carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli (CRGNBs) from 179 patients (158 inpatients and 21 outpatients) between January 2016 and April 2017 were analysed retrospectively. Alignment of plasmid content for 32 isolates from 16 patients with multiple CRGNB species was performed from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. Results: Sixteen of the 179 patients (8.9%) were colonized and/or infected with more than one CRGNB species; 11/179 (6.1%) were colonized by multiple carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CREs) and 5/179 (2.8%) by carbapenem-resistant non-fermenters (CRNFs) and CREs. WGS suggested interspecies transfer as the predominant mechanism rather than independent acquisition in 8/10 patients (80%, one non-recoverable isolate) with multiple CREs but not in CRNF-CRE combinations; 30/158 inpatients (20%) had underlying haematological malignancies, and they are more likely to exhibit multiple CRGNB strains (OR 3.0, 95%CI 0.98-8.89, p 0.05) and CRE strains (OR 3.9, 95%CI 1.02-14.58, p 0.04) during hospital stay compared to other patient groups. Conclusion: Our data give insight into the occurrence of natural in vivo HGT in a clinical setting. Better understanding of HGT will help optimize containment measures and may guide antibiotic stewardship programmes. (C) 2019 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

The present study investigated the influence of body size on trophic interactions between juveniles of two closely related fish species at three sandy beaches in south-eastern Brazil. A total of 150 fish were sampled, where 103 were identified asTrachinotus carolinus(mean +/- SE: weight = 9 g +/- 1.13) and 47 asTrachinotus goodei(weight = 46.7 g +/- 3.34). A significant size-difference between juvenileTrachinotuswas detected by a null-model analysis (P= 0.04), withT. carolinus(TL = 79.6 mm +/- 2.4) presenting a smaller body size thanT. goodei(TL = 147.7 mm +/- 4.2). The main prey items consumed byT. carolinuswerePerna perna(IAi = 0.76) andEmerita brasiliensis(IAi = 0.18), whereas the latter was the majorT. goodeidietary prey (IAi = 0.71). Both prey were correlated with larger-sized juveniles of each pompano species, whereas smaller fish shared non-preferred trophic items. Such opportunistic behaviour of smaller juveniles may account for the dietary overlap detected between theTrachinotusspecies (P= 0.09). Size-related dietary partitioning was observed for the largestT. goodeijuveniles, which displayed only a slight overlap withT. carolinus, and between juveniles belonging to the small and medium size groups of each pompano species. Therefore, food partitioning related to pompano body size seems to be especially important for the smallest juveniles, as they present the highest vacuity (particularlyT. carolinus) in the sampled beaches, suggesting that these individuals are under intra- and interspecific competitive pressure, which may affect local coexistence.","[Silva de Souza, Joice; Neves dos Santos, Luciano] Fed Univ State Rio de Janeiro UNIRIO, Lab Theoret & Appl Ichthyol LICTA, Ave Pasteur 458-R314A, BR-22290240 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Silva de Souza, Joice; Neves dos Santos, Luciano] Rio de Janeiro State Univ UERJ, Grad Course Ecol & Evolut PPGEE, Sao Francisco Xavier St 524,PHLC R220, BR-20550900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil","de Souza, JS (corresponding author), Fed Univ State Rio de Janeiro UNIRIO, Lab Theoret & Appl Ichthyol LICTA, Ave Pasteur 458-R314A, BR-22290240 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.; de Souza, JS (corresponding author), Rio de Janeiro State Univ UERJ, Grad Course Ecol & Evolut PPGEE, Sao Francisco Xavier St 524,PHLC R220, BR-20550900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",joiceess@gmail.com,"Souza, Joice/ABD-2702-2020; Santos, Luciano N/M-4377-2015","Souza, Joice/0000-0003-2306-312X","Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil [E-26/111.548/2010]; Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), BrazilConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [314379/2018-5]","This work was funded by Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (research grant to L.N.S., E-26/111.548/2010), Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO) and National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Brazil (Research Grant to L.N.S., ref. 314379/2018-5) (Programa PELD e Guanabara) (undergraduate scholarship to J.S.S).",,67,0,0,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0025-3154,1469-7769,,J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK,J.

The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), the largest carnivorous marsupial, coexists with the smaller spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus) in Tasmania, Australia. Quolls may be susceptible to interspecific competition from devils, because they utilise similar habitats, consume similar prey species and are displaced by devils at food sources. Such competition might cause quolls to spatially or temporally avoid devils. To investigate whether spatial or temporal avoidance occurred, we deployed GPS collars on sympatric devils and quolls and conducted a camera survey at a site in northwest Tasmania where the devil population was not affected by devil facial tumour disease. GPS tracking coincided with the lactation period when devils and quolls had young in dens and continued until weaning occurred. We found little spatial segregation of home range and core area placement between devils and quolls and among devils. Quolls showed more spatial segregation within the sexes than between them. Devils had larger home ranges than quolls. Male devils had larger home ranges than females, but there was no difference in home range size between the sexes of quolls. Females of both species travelled significantly further per night than did males. There was moderate temporal partitioning between the two species: devil activity peaked after dusk and devils remained active until the early morning, while quoll activity showed distinct peaks around dusk and dawn. In conclusion, quolls did not spatially avoid devils but moderate temporal partitioning occurred. It is plausible that quolls are active at different times of the diel cycle to reduce encountering devils, but further studies are needed to resolve the cause of this temporal partitioning.","[Andersen, Georgina E.; Johnson, Christopher N.; Jones, Menna E.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Johnson, Christopher N.] Univ Tasmania, Australian Res Council Ctr Australian Biodivers &, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Andersen, GE (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",georgina.andersen@utas.edu.au,,"Jones, Menna/0000-0001-7558-9022; Andersen, Georgina/0000-0001-9425-8296",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [ARC DP110103069]; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Dr. Eric Guiler Tasmanian devil research grant,"We thank the Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service for permission to conduct this study in the Arthur-Pieman Conservation Area and Westmore Pastoral Company for permission to conduct this research on their land.

The environment influences the microbiota composition; however, the relative mosquito-species contribution has not been rigorously disentangled from the environmental contribution to the microbiota structure. Also, the extent to which the microbiota of the adult sugar food source and larval water can predict that of the adult midgut and vice versa is not fully understood. To address these relationships, larvae and adults of Anopheles gambiae and Aedes albopictus were either reared separately or in a co-rearing system, whereby aquatic and adult stages of both species shared the larval water and sugar food source, respectively. Despite being reared under identical conditions, clear intra- and interspecies differences in midgut microbiota-composition were observed across seven cohorts, collected at different time points over a period of eight months. Fitting a linear model separately for each OTU in the mosquito midgut showed that two OTUs significantly differed between the midguts of the two mosquito species. We also show an effect for the sugar food source and larval water on the adult midgut microbiota.

Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is a widely adapted aphid in the agroecosystems and is one of the main bell pepper pests. In the present study, we determined the spatial and temporal dynamics and the regulatory factors of M. persicae populations in bell pepper crops. The number of aphids and their natural enemies were evaluated during 2 years in four commercial bell pepper fields. Myzus persicae density data were related to temperature, rainfall, and natural enemies by multiple regression analysis and were then submitted to geostatistical analysis. The density of M. persicae was higher during the plant's reproductive growth stage. Rainfall, Chrysoperla spp., and Toxomerus spp. regulate M. persicae populations. Initial infestations of this pest occur along the edges of the fields and subsequently spread towards the center. This information is useful for integrated management programs aimed at anticipating periods of higher abundance of M. persicae and identifying arthropods to be prioritized in biological control.","[Soares, J.

This study characterised patterns in abundance of three common nearshore species, yellow perch Perca flavescens (Mitchell), round goby Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas) and alewife Alosa pseudoharengus (Wilson), in relation to spatio-temporal, abiotic and biotic factors using gillnet sampling conducted across 5 years at multiple locations representing different substrates. Significant variations were observed in alewife and round goby catches between locations. A negative relationship between round goby and age-0 yellow perch catch was observed, indicating potential competition between the two species. This study demonstrates that variability in nearshore fish communities can be driven by factors including substrate and interspecific interactions.

Dynamic two-species occupancy models provide a flexible framework to decompose complex species interaction patterns, while accounting for imperfect detection. These models can describe poachers-wildlife interactions, as they allow estimating occupancy, extinction and colonisation probabilities of wildlife conditional on the occurrence of poachers and vice versa. We applied our model to a case study on wildlife poaching in the eastern plains of Cambodia. We used co-occurrence data extracted from the database of the SMART partnership to study the distribution dynamics between poachers and six ungulate species pooled together into the tiger prey guild. We used four years of survey data reporting the locations of snares and of presence signs of the ungulates recorded by rangers during their monthly multi-patrolling sessions. Our results showed that a substantial proportion of the sites occupied by ungulate species went extinct over the years of the study while the proportion of sites colonised by poachers increased. We also showed, for the first time, that spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the patrolling effort explains a great deal of the variation in the detection of poachers and ungulates. Our approach provides practitioners with a flexible and robust tool to assess conservation status of species and extinction risk of wildlife populations. It can assist managers in better evaluating, learning and adapting the patrolling strategies of rangers.","[Marescot, Lucile; Gimenez, Olivier] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, CEFE, Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Lyet, Arnaud] World Wildlife Fund, 1250 24th St,NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Singh, Rohit] Wildlife Crime ACAI, World Wide Fund Nat, Singapore, Singapore; [Carter, Neil] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Marescot, L (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, CEFE, Univ Paul Valery Montpellier 3,EPHE,IRD, Montpellier, France.",lucile.marescot@cefe.cnrs.fr,,"Gimenez, Olivier/0000-0001-7001-5142; Carter, Neil/0000-0002-4399-6384",French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-16-CE02-0007],LM and OG were funded by the French National Research Agency (grant ANR-16-CE02-0007).,,39,3,3,2,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,FEB,2020,43,2,,,,,239,250,,10.1111/ecog.04536,,OCT 2019,12,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KH4DR,WOS:000492425000001,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2021-09-21,

Here, we asked whether coastal heath vegetation established in stressful habitats could be assembled by quasi-neutral mechanisms based on functional trait distribution. Communities are organized through quasi-neutral dynamics if abiotic gradients and/or species interactions impose sorting on functional traits and species performances, but not on species phylogenetic relatedness and occurrence. Methods The study was conducted in a coastal area containing tall dunes near the sea, and relatively flat areas punctuated by short palaeodunes further inland, Northeastern South America. We evaluated 10 traits of the 21 most abundant species, as well as eight abiotic variables in 70 plots (25 m(2)) established in dune tops, valleys, flat and steep microenvironments. The effect of environmental filter was tested by linear mixed models (LMM) between each community-weighted mean (CWM) trait and the abiotic variables, and by two indices of environmental filtering based on intra-and interspecific-trait variability relative to null models. To evaluate the effect of species interactions, we used an index of niche overlap relative to null models, and LMMs between this index and the species richness of plots. Important Findings The environmental filtering index did not deviate from null expectations for any trait. Models that included individual variability performed similarly to models that used species mean traits. However, the explicit consideration of environmental gradients by CWM analyses revealed functional patterns that would remain undetected if trait distribution was analyzed only. In addition, intraspecific variation in the stem length was an important driver of species diversity as suggested by the relationship between species richness and the niche overlap index. Based on the occurrence and phylogenetic relatedness of species, previous work in the same system found neutral community assembly. We concluded that to ignore functional traits may lead to underestimations of niche-based processes, and that analyses of species occurrence and phylogenetic relatedness should be complemented with functional traits to reinforce our interpretation of processes underpinning community assembly. In this regard, the study heath vegetation is influenced by quasi-neutral effects on functional trait distribution.","[Alves Silva, Jose Luiz] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Dept Ecologia, BR-59078970 Natal, RN, Brazil; [Souza, Alexandre Fadigas] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Ecol, BR-59078970 Natal, RN, Brazil; [Stephen Santiago, Louis] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, 2150 Batchelor Hall, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Stephen Santiago, Louis] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Panama City, Panama","Silva, JLA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Dept Ecologia, BR-59078970 Natal, RN, Brazil.",luizecologia@gmail.com,"Silva, Jose/AAW-1148-2021; Souza, Alexandre/ABD-1700-2020; Silva, Jose/ABF-2669-2020; Santiago, Louis S/E-3185-2016","Silva, Jose/0000-0003-0314-7625; Souza, Alexandre/0000-0001-7468-3631; Santiago, Louis S/0000-0001-5994-6122",Fulbright U.S. Student Program; CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),Research was supported by a doctoral scholarship to J.L.A.S. from the Fulbright U.S. Student Program and CAPES.

Thus, if we find natural hybrids between a SC species and a closely related self-incompatible (SI) species, the pollen donor is usually expected to be the SC species. However, in previous studies of naturally occurring mixed populations of invasive Cakile maritima (SI) and Cakile edentula (SC) in Australia, hybridisation was found to have been bidirectional. Here, we explored the floral development of these species in order to test the hypothesis that there might be a short opportunity for pollinators to visit open SC flowers before the self-pollen is released. Results indicated that both species showed reverse herkogamy during early development, though by the time pollen was ripe the four long anthers always overtopped the stigma; in C. maritima, most of the short anthers remained below the stigma. In both species, ripe, compatible pollen was able to germinate on the stigmatic surface at all stages of floral development. Anther dehiscence commenced earlier in C. edentula and well before flowers opened, in contrast to C. maritima, but the timing of pollen release varied between individual flowers, with a small proportion of uncontaminated stigmas after flowering; therefore, C. edentula can be either pollen recipient or pollen donor when interspecific outcrossing occurs. In summary, our results suggest that the variation between individual flowers of C. edentula contributed to the bidirectional hybridisation despite being a predominant selfer, providing new insights into plant colonisation.","[Li, C.; Cousens, R.

Much of what we know has been learned from studies that retrospectively posit mechanisms presumed to have generated the observed spatial patterns. Here we present a prospective approach. We start by measuring spatial demographic effects and evaluate if they can generate observed spatial patterns. We evaluated the influence of interactions among conspecifics on vital rates, demography and spatial distribution of Croton aff. wagneri, a dominant shrub in dry Andean ecosystems. Recruitment, survival and growth varied in relation with distance to conspecifics neighbours and with their summed cover. We built a spatial individual-based model and simulated its population dynamics in 30 x 30m plots for a 30-year period. We compared the predicted spatial pattern from these demographic models with that observed among plants in 16 independent plots with the same area. Simulated populations mimicked observed spatial patterns, although in plots at high elevations the simulated populations did not reproduce the observed inhibition at small scales. Observed and simulated patterns indicated differences between elevations in maximum aggregation and location of the distances with higher aggregation. We discuss how consideration of critical seed and juvenile stages and interspecific interactions could further improve our understanding of spatial pattern and recommend that these factors be considered in future models.","[Espinosa, Carlos I.; Velez-Mora, Diego P.; Ramon, Pablo; Gusman-Montalvan, Elizabeth; Duncan, David H.; Quintana-Ascencio, Pedro F.] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Loja, Ecuador; [Duncan, David H.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Quintana-Ascencio, Pedro F.] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Biol, Orlando, FL 32816 USA","Quintana-Ascencio, PF (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Dept Biol, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",pedro.quintana-ascencio@ucf.edu,"Quintana-Ascencio, Pedro F/F-7263-2013; Espinosa, Carlos Ivan/AAI-1305-2019; Duncan, David/H-2000-2013","Espinosa, Carlos Ivan/0000-0002-5330-4505; Duncan, David/0000-0003-4411-8214","UTPL [PROY_CNN_1054, PROY_CNN_0001, PROY_CNN_1260, PROY_CNN_0014]; Secretaria Nacional de Educacion Superior de Ciencia; Tecnologia e Innovacion - SENESCYT","UTPL, Grant/Award Numbers: PROY_CNN_1054, PROY_CNN_0001, PROY_CNN_1260, PROY_CNN_0014; Tecnologia e Innovacion - SENESCYT; Secretaria Nacional de Educacion Superior de Ciencia",,62,2,2,3,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

To design optimal crop mixtures, choices of species, genotypes, sowing proportion, plant arrangement, and sowing date need to be made but field experiments alone are not sufficient to explore such a large range of factors. Crop modeling allows to study, understand, and ultimately design cropping systems and is an established method for sole crops. Recently, modeling started to be applied to annual crop mixtures as well. Here, we review to what extent crop simulation models and individual-based models are suitable to capture and predict the specificities of annual crop mixtures. We argued that (1) the crop mixture spatio-temporal heterogeneity (influencing the occurrence of ecological processes) determines the choice of the modeling approach (plant or crop centered). (2) Only few crop models (adapted from sole crop models) and individual-based models currently exist to simulate annual crop mixtures. Crop models are mainly used to address issues related to both crop mixtures management and the integration of crop mixtures into larger scales such as the rotation. In contrast, individual-based models are mainly used to identify plant traits involved in crop mixture performance and to quantify the relative contribution of the different ecological processes (niche complementarity, facilitation, competition, plasticity) to crop mixture functioning. This review highlights that modeling of annual crop mixtures is in its infancy and gives to model users some important keys to choose the model based on the questions they want to answer, with awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of each of the modeling approaches.","[Gaudio, Noemie; Casadebaig, Pierre; Bergez, Jacques-Eric] Univ Toulouse, INRA, AGIR, Castanet Tolosan, France; [Escobar-Gutierrez, Abraham J.; Louarn, Gaetan; Barillot, Romain; Combes, Didier; Durand, Jean-Louis; Frak, Ela] INRA, Equipe Ecophysiol Plantes Fourrageres, URP3F, Le Chene RD 150,BP 6, F-86600 Lusignan, France; [Evers, Jochem B.; Van der Werf, Wopke] Wageningen Univ & Res, Ctr Crop Syst Anal, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Gerard, Frederic; Hinsinger, Philippe] Univ Montpellier, Eco&Sols, INRA, CIRAD,IRD,SupAgro, Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Colbach, Nathalie] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, AgroSup Dijon, Agroecol, INRA, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Munz, Sebastian] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Crop Sci, Dept Agron, Stuttgart, Germany; [Launay, Marie] INRA, AgroClim, Agroparc, US1116, F-84914 Avignon 9, France; [Marrou, Helene; Justes, Eric] Univ Montpellier, Montpellier Supagro, INRA, CIHEAM IAMM,CIRAD,UMR Syst, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Pages, Loic] Ctr PACA, INRA, Agroparc, UR PSH 1115, F-84914 Avignon 9, France; [Pradal, Christophe] Univ Montpellier, INRA, CIRAD, SupAgro,AGAP, Montpellier, France; [Pradal, Christophe] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, AGAP, Montpellier, France; [Pradal, Christophe] Univ Montpellier, INRIA Zenith, Montpellier, France; [Saint-Jean, Sebastien] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, UMR ECOSYS INRA, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France","Gaudio, N (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, INRA, AGIR, Castanet Tolosan, France.",noemie.gaudio@inra.fr,"Casadebaig, Pierre/AAL-6998-2020; Colbach, Nathalie/C-6677-2014; Gaetan, Louarn/C-4454-2013; Casadebaig, Pierre/AAL-3307-2020; Hinsinger, Philippe/AAI-6930-2020; Escobar-Gutierrez, Abraham/A-6613-2009; Barillot, Romain/G-2016-2012","Casadebaig, Pierre/0000-0001-7225-936X; Colbach, Nathalie/0000-0002-3791-037X; Gaetan, Louarn/0000-0003-3701-7036; Escobar-Gutierrez, Abraham/0000-0002-5111-9998; Barillot, Romain/0000-0002-9956-9103; Pradal, Christophe/0000-0002-2555-761X; Gaudio, Noemie/0000-0002-4528-9851; Justes, Eric/0000-0001-7390-7058; FRAK, Ela/0000-0002-1676-5249; Evers, Jochem/0000-0002-3956-0190; Munz, Sebastian/0000-0001-6713-1863",European UnionEuropean Commission; INRA Environment and Agronomy Division through the project IDEA,"The authors acknowledge support from European Union through the project H2020 ReMIX (Redesigning European cropping systems based on species mixtures, https://www.remixintercrops.eu/) and from INRA Environment and Agronomy Division through the project IDEA (Intra- and interspecific diversity mixture in agriculture).

Statistical approaches for conducting such analyses have come a long way in the last few decades, and it is now possible to use comparative data to ask sophisticated questions about the evolution of complex phenotypes while taking also uncertainty in the phylogeny into account. Here, we illustrate these advances by applying a phylogenetic analysis of covariance to two data sets addressing the evolution of social complexity in primates. First, we find that social complexity (as inferred by group size) is predicted by whether a species is diurnal and terrestrial. Second, we find that social complexity (as inferred by social organization) has increased over evolutionary time and can impact trait evolution. Particularly, we find that baculum length has been growing with body size in dispersed, pair-living and, more weakly, multi-male species, becoming relatively smaller and more variable in aggregations that are more socially stable.Significance statementSociality poses a particular challenge for interspecific analyses because of the many ways that its intrinsic complexity can be coded into statistical variables and models. However, with methods that incorporate phylogenies and nuanced inferences about underlying evolutionary processes, even coarse measures of social complexity can offer valuable insights in the study of behavioral trends through time. Exploring two interspecific data sets on primates, we show how simple measures of sociality, either coded as continuous or categorical variables, can be used to revisit latent evolutionary hypotheses while revealing new pieces of information that become available thanks to the added complexity of novel phylogenetic comparative methods. One example reveals that larger and more variable groups are associated with shifts in habitat and activity patterns, while the other reveals that baculum evolution might be influenced by the increasing social stability of primate aggregations.","[Fuentes-Gonzalez, Jesualdo A.; Martins, Emilia P.] Arizona State Univ, 427 East Tyler Mall, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Fuentes-Gonzalez, Jesualdo A.; Martins, Emilia P.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Fuentes-Gonzalez, JA (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, 427 East Tyler Mall, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.; Fuentes-Gonzalez, JA (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",jafuent8@asu.edu,,"Martins, Emilia/0000-0002-8952-3240; Fuentes Gonzalez, Jesualdo Arturo/0000-0001-8457-6274","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1257562]; COLCIENCIAS (Becas Caldas)Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias [497-2009]; Center for the Integrative Study of Animal Behavior (CISAB) at Indiana University",This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number IOS-1257562 to EPM.

These two assumptions have been scarcely tested on the individual level, especially in species-rich tropical ecosystems. Here, we adapted intraspecific specialisation (ISpe) and intraspecific originality indices (IOri) to assess complementary components of intraspecific variability. Next, we applied these indices to evaluate the intra- and interspecific variability of morphological and diet traits in two contrasting Brazilian stream-dwelling fish assemblages (rainforest and savannah). We also compared correlations between morphology and diet at the individual and species level to test whether accounting for intraspecific variability increases the predictability of diet due to morphological differences. Significant contributions of intraspecific variability to differences between fish were revealed for morphology and diet. Intraspecific variability in the diet was higher than that in morphology in both assemblages. The ISpe was positively correlated to IOri in the diet of both ecosystems. The morphological-dietary relationships were significant but weak at both individual and species levels. Our findings highlight the importance of measuring individual variability and accounting for complementary components of the intraspecific variability (ISpe and IOri). Importantly, we showed that the variability in morphology does not predict diet variability at both intra- and interspecific levels. Thus, high intraspecific variability in morphology and diet challenges the use of functional traits measured at the species level to describe the functional diversity of different fish assemblages.","[Manna, Luisa Resende; Mazzoni, Rosana] Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Lab Ecol Peixes, Inst Biol Roberto Alcantara Gomes, Dept Ecol, Rua Sao Francisco Xavier 524, BR-20550013 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Villeger, Sebastien] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IFREMER, MARBEC,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Rezende, Carla Ferreira] Univ Fed Ceara, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Recursos Nat, Dept Biol, Ctr Ciencias, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil","Manna, LR (corresponding author), Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Lab Ecol Peixes, Inst Biol Roberto Alcantara Gomes, Dept Ecol, Rua Sao Francisco Xavier 524, BR-20550013 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",luisamanna@gmail.com,"Villeger, Sebastien/C-6272-2011; Rezende, Carla Ferreira/G-2050-2012; Mazzoni, Rosana/B-3461-2013; Manna, Luisa R/E-9780-2015","Villeger, Sebastien/0000-0002-2362-7178; Rezende, Carla Ferreira/0000-0002-2319-6558; Mazzoni, Rosana/0000-0001-8780-7779; ","Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de JaneiroFundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ) [E-26/202.782/2016, E-26/202.783/2016, E-26/203.193/2015]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel SuperiorCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [BEX 0152/14-5]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [PQ CNPQ 311621/2013-6, PQ CNPQ 311627/2015-3]; Prociencia/SR2/UERJ","Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Grant/Award Number: E-26/202.782/2016, E-26/202.783/2016 and E-26/203.193/2015; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior, Grant/Award Number: BEX 0152/14-5; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: PQ CNPQ 311621/2013-6 and PQ CNPQ 311627/2015-3; Prociencia/SR2/UERJ",,86,4,7,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

Niche differentiation evolves due to stable coexistence of species in a community, suggesting that in unstable communities, the niches of species should largely overlap. Here, we test this prediction using empirical data on the trophic-niche structure of several belowground collembolan communities of natural (forest and meadow) and disturbed (pasture and urban lawn) habitats. Scaled stable isotope compositions of carbon and nitrogen were used to reveal the trophic specialization of species. In full agreement with the theoretical predictions, trophic-niche structure collapsed in disturbed habitats, which was illustrated by decreased interspecific and increased intraspecific variation in the stable isotope compositions. In stable natural habitats, different trophic niches are occupied by different collembolan species, but in disturbed habitats, poor niche specialization is partly compensated for by intraspecific trophic flexibility. The simplification of food-web structure was in line with the evidence coming from disturbed aquatic ecosystems, suggesting that the collapse of trophic-niche structure may be a common feature of disturbed communities across biomes.","[Korotkevich, Anastasiya Yu.; Kuznetsova, Natalia A.] Moscow State Pedag Univ, Inst Biol & Chem, Kibalchicha St 6k3, Moscow 129164, Russia; [Potapov, Anton M.; Tiunov, Alexei V.] Russian Acad Sci, AN Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut, Leninsky Prospect 33, Moscow 119071, Russia; [Potapov, Anton M.] Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Potapov, AM (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, AN Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut, Leninsky Prospect 33, Moscow 119071, Russia.; Potapov, AM (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, JF Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",potapov.msu@gmail.com,"Potapov, Anton/M-2370-2016; Tiunov, Alexei V./F-7771-2013","Potapov, Anton/0000-0002-4456-1710; Tiunov, Alexei V./0000-0003-2400-3559","Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [16-04-01228, 17-04-01856]; German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG)","Natalia Kuznetsova and Anastasiya Korotkevich designed the research, and performed the field sampling and animal identification.

This study showed that the cocultivation of Paenibacillus amylolyticus and Xanthomonas retroflexus exhibited facultative mutualistic interactions in a static environment, during the course of which a new adapted phenotypic variant of X. retroflexus appeared. Although the emergence of this variant was not directly linked to the presence of P. amylolyticus, its establishment in the coculture enhanced the productivity of both species due to mutations that stimulated biofilm formation. The mutations were detected in genes encoding a diguanylate cyclase predicted to synthesise cyclic-di-GMP. Examinations of the biofilm formed in cocultures of P. amylolyticus and the new variant of X. retroflexus revealed a distinct spatial organisation: P. amylolyticus only resided in biofilms in association with X. retroflexus and occupied the outer layers. The X. retroflexus variant therefore facilitated increased P. amylolyticus growth as it produced more biofilm biomass. The increase in X. retroflexus biomass was thus not at the expense of P. amylolyticus, demonstrating that interspecies interactions can shape diversification in a mutualistic coculture and reinforce these interactions, ultimately resulting in enhanced communal performance.","[Roder, Henriette L.; Herschend, Jakob; Russel, Jakob; Andersen, Michala F.; Madsen, Jonas S.; Sorensen, Soren J.; Burmolle, Mette] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark","Burmolle, M (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",burmolle@bio.ku.dk,"Russel, Jakob/J-8026-2019; Sorensen, Soren Johannes/N-2120-2019; Sorensen, Soren J/J-5015-2014; Burmolle, Mette/L-8002-2014","Russel, Jakob/0000-0002-0565-3161; Sorensen, Soren Johannes/0000-0001-6227-9906; Sorensen, Soren J/0000-0001-6227-9906; Roeder, Henriette Lyng/0000-0002-0965-6837; Madsen, Jonas Stenlokke/0000-0003-4830-1796; Burmolle, Mette/0000-0003-1870-632X",Danish Council for Independent ResearchDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF) [DFF-1110-6571]; Villum Foundation [10098],"The authors would like to thank Anette Loth and Jonas Oftebro-Svendsen for their assistance in the laboratory.

Assuming the size-dependency of patch departure behaviour, model-based approaches have shown size-mediated coexistence in systems of competing species. However, experimental evidence for the influence of body size on patch use behaviour is scarce. In this study, we explore whether allometric principles provide an underlying framework for interspecific patterns of resource use. To this end, we propose a meso-cosm approach using three species of gastropods differing in size as a model system and P-32 radio-isotopic techniques as a measure of resource use. Foragers of different size were placed in an artificial patch, provided with a limited amount of labelled resource and let them free to move as resources decrease and scarcity is sensed. We investigated the extent to which individual body size affects the exploitation of resources by examining Giving Up Density (GUD), Giving Up Time (GUT), resource absorption rate and exploitation efficiency as components of individual exploitation behaviour. To compare positive, constant and negative individual size scaling of population energy requirements, experimental trials with an equal numbers and equal biomass of differently sized foragers were carried out, and an experimental trial with equal metabolic requirements was simulated. We observed clear size dependency in the patch departure behaviour of the experimental organisms. Even under conditions of equivalent overall population energy requirements, larger foragers decided to leave the resource patch earlier and at a higher density of resources than smaller ones. Smaller foragers were able to prolong their presence and make more use of the resources, resulting in an inverse body-size scaling of resource exploitation efficiency.","[Cozzoli, Francesco; Ligetta, Giovanna; Vignes, Fabio; Basset, Alberto] Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, Lab Ecol, Lecce, Italy","Cozzoli, F; Basset, A (corresponding author), Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, Lab Ecol, Lecce, Italy.",francesco.cozzoli@unisalento.it; alberto.basset@unisalento.it,"Vignes, Fabio/G-9998-2011; Cozzoli, Francesco/K-1273-2019","Vignes, Fabio/0000-0003-0579-6629; Cozzoli, Francesco/0000-0002-6413-0977",ECOPOTENTIAL project (H2020) [641762]; LifeWatch - Italy network,"This work was supported by a grant from the ECOPOTENTIAL project (H2020, grant agreement No 641762) to FC and by LifeWatch - Italy network.

In Argentine Patagonia, the exotic European hare has one of the highest numbers recorded worldwide and is now a widely consumed prey for many predators. We examine the potential relationship between abundance of this relatively new prey and the abundance and breeding spacing of one of its main consumers, the Black-chested Buzzard-Eagle (Geranoaetus melartoleucus). First we analyze the abundance of individuals of a raptor guild in relation to hare abundance through a correspondence analysis. We then estimated the Nearest Neighbor Distance (NND) of the Black-chested Buzzard-eagle abundances in the two areas with high hare abundances. Finally, we performed a meta regression between the NND and the body masses of Accipitridae raptors, to evaluate if Black-chested Buzzard eagle NND deviates from the expected according to their mass. We found that eagle abundance was highly associated with hare abundance, more than with any other raptor species in the study area. Their NND deviates from the value expected, which was significantly lower than expected for a raptor species of this size in two areas with high hare abundance. Our results support the hypothesis that high local abundance of prey leads to a reduction of the breeding spacing of its main predator, which could potentially alter other interspecific interactions, and thus the entire community.","[Barbar, Facundo; Ignazi, Gonzalo O.; Lambertucci, Sergio A.] Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Ecotono Lab, Grp Biol Conservac, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Hiraldo, Fernando] Estn Biol Donana CSIC Espana, Dept Biol Conservac, Seville, Spain","Barbar, F (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Ecotono Lab, Grp Biol Conservac, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.",facundo.barbar@gmail.com,"Hiraldo, Fernando/AAA-8314-2019","LAMBERTUCCI, SERGIO/0000-0002-2624-2185",,,,86,6,6,0,3,PEERJ INC,LONDON,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",2167-8359,,,PEERJ,PeerJ,MAY 10,2018,6,,,,,,,,e4746,10.7717/peerj.4746,,,17,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,GF5OE,WOS:000432016600002,29761058,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2021-09-21,

Most species distribution models correlate the occurrence of a single species with environmental variables only, and leave out biotic interactions. To test the importance of biotic interactions on occurrence and abundance, we compared a multivariate spatiotemporal model of the joint abundance of two invasive insects that share a host plant, hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae) and elongate hemlock scale (EHS; Fiorina externa), to independent models that do not account for dependence among co-occurring species. The joint model revealed that HWA responded more strongly to abiotic conditions than EHS. Additionally, HWA appeared to predispose stands to subsequent increase of EHS, but HWA abundance was not strongly dependent on EHS abundance. This study demonstrates how incorporating spatial and temporal dependence into a species distribution model can reveal the dependence of a species' abundance on other species in the community. Accounting for dependence among co-occurring species with a joint distribution model can also improve estimation of the abiotic niche for species affected by interspecific interactions.","[Lany, Nina K.; Zarnetske, Phoebe L.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Lany, Nina K.; Zarnetske, Phoebe L.] Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Schliep, Erin M.] Univ Missouri, Dept Stat, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Schaeffer, Robert N.; Orians, Colin M.] Tufts Univ, Dept Biol, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Orwig, David A.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA 01366 USA; [Preisser, Evan L.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","Lany, NK (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.; Lany, NK (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",lanynina@msu.edu,"Schaeffer, Robert/R-7577-2019; Zarnetske, Phoebe/V-3974-2019","Zarnetske, Phoebe/0000-0001-6257-6951; Orwig, David/0000-0001-7822-3560; Orians, Colin/0000-0003-3773-0894","Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation; Michigan State University; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project [1010055]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0715504, DEB-1256769, DEB-1256826]; NIFAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-67013-30142]; Harvard Forest Long-Term Ecological Research Program [NSF DEB 06-20443]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1237491] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","N.

Why colonies adopt closed versus open societies is not well understood, but it is presumably related to the genetic or environmental identity of individuals. In this study, we use Canadian populations of the Eastern subterranean termite (Reticulitermes flavipes) to test for evidence of aggression and nestmate recognition. Specifically, we predict that any inter-colony aggression will increase as a function of geographic distance. In short-term, (5-min) Petri-dish trials (varying caste, group size and colony source) we observed no evidence of aggression. However, in 2- and 7-day shared-resource assays, we observed very little inter-colony mixing and a high incidence of mortality in non-nestmate pairings. Our long-term observations imply that subterranean termites sort and potentially compete on the basis of nest origin, and that this recognition is mediated in part by ecological context. This behavior would not be evident from Petri dish-style assays, which lack this context and may explain why prior studies of kin or nestmate recognition in R. flavipes have yielded mixed results.","[Simkovic, V.; Thompson, G.

Pastoral practices are known as a main interspecies pathogen transmission. Hence, the presence of pestivirus in transhumant sheep flocks and sympatric chamois was assessed in areas with different epidemiological scenarios of chamois BDV infections. Moreover, the present study had also the goal to identify if inter-specific infections occurred and when they happened. Five sheep flocks grazing in two alpine areas in the Pyrenees with two different BDV epidemiological scenarios in chamois populations were studied during two transhumant seasons. Sheep were sampled before and after transhumance. Pyrenean chamois sera and spleen samples from both areas where also studied during the same period. Antibodies against BDV were assessed by means of ELISA and VNT. A qRT-PCR was used in order to detect the virus. Seroprevalence in sheep ranged between 0 and 91.1% at the flock level. Chamois were found to have high seroprevalences (52.9-77.7%) in both areas, and four new BDV isolates were sequenced. One sheep farm presented persistent BDV circulation and three showed low BDV circulation. The after-transhumance period was identified as the moment when viral transmission occured in the first farm, associated to BDV strains of domestic origin, according to VNT results.

The fungus mainly affects the blossoms and fruit, and the resulting disease can lead to significant pre- and postharvest yield losses. Estimated yearly cost to the U.S. stakeholders for chemical protection against the disease can reach $170M. Although some degree of resistance in peach landraces ('Bolinha') and interspecific material (almond x peach) has been reported, genetic resistance to brown rot in peaches is still lacking. In commercial peach production, the disease is managed by practicing sanitation and the application of fungicides. The Clemson University peach breeding program within the RosBREED project aims to understand the genetics behind the peach fruit response to brown rot with the ultimate goal of combining disease resistance with high fruit quality via DNA informed breeding. To this end, 26 cultivars /advanced selections and 138 progeny, representing 9 breeding families, with 'Bolinha' source of resistance have been phenotyped for fruit response to brown rot using wounded and non-wounded disease assays in 2015 and 2016. Previously obtained genotypic data, and reported QTLs associated with brown rot response in peach fruit, were used to obtain preliminary information on variability in brown rot associated genornic regions. Phenotypic performance or trait values of these alleles/haplotypes were discussed. The data presented here provide a foundation for developing predictive DNA information that has potential for immediate application in U.S. peach breeding.","[Fu, Wanfang; Burrell, Ralph; Linge, Cassia Da Silva; Schnabel, Guido; Gasic, Ksenija] Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA","Gasic, K (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",kgasic@clemson.edu,"Gasic, Ksenija/AAN-6234-2021; da Silva Linge, Cassia/C-9538-2019","Gasic, Ksenija/0000-0003-4391-5262; da Silva Linge, Cassia/0000-0003-4760-1359",USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2014-51181-22378],This work was supported by USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture for the Specialty Crop Research Initiative through the competitive project RosBREED: Combining disease resistance with horticultural quality in new rosaceous cultivars (2014-51181-22378).

The spatial and demographic structure of colonizing populations inform about their state and potential trends, since the initial colonization by dispersing individuals precedes the establishment of a population with potential for further growth and expansion. Once colonization has succeeded, the spatial pattern of animal abundance is associated with intra- and interspecific interactions and environmental factors (e.g., habitat and food availability) and the population shows similar demographic features throughout the whole occupation area, which has been called a diffusive dispersal pattern. Here, we analyze the current status of colonization by a guanaco population of ranches surrounding a protected area in Chilean Patagonia with data gathered along three consecutive years. We thus compared animal abundance and social structure between the protected and unprotected areas and evaluated throughout the whole area the effect of environmental factors on guanaco abundance, proportion of family groups, and reproductive success. Guanaco abundance significantly declined with increasing distance from the center of the local distribution and marginally with predation risk. Moreover, social structure showed only minor differences between areas, pointing to a diffusive dispersal pattern. These results suggest that the population is already well established and has the potential to grow and continue its expansion. The case exemplifies a challenging outcome of successful animal conservation, and it presents a useful approach to evaluate the state of wild ungulate populations colonizing new areas.","[Iranzo, Esperanza C.] Univ Nacl La Pampa UNLPam, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, CONICET, Inst Ciencias Tierra & Ambientales La Pampa INCIT, Avda Uruguay 151, RA-6300 Santa Rosa, La Pampa, Argentina; [Iranzo, Esperanza C.; Acebes, Pablo; Mata, Cristina; Malo, Juan E.; Traba, Juan] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, TEG, C Darwin 2, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Estades, Cristian F.; Gonzalez, Benito A.] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias Forestales & Conservac Nat, Av Sta Rosa 11315, La Pintana, Region Metropol, Chile","Iranzo, EC (corresponding author), Univ Nacl La Pampa UNLPam, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, CONICET, Inst Ciencias Tierra & Ambientales La Pampa INCIT, Avda Uruguay 151, RA-6300 Santa Rosa, La Pampa, Argentina.; Iranzo, EC (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol, TEG, C Darwin 2, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",esperanza.iranzo@gmail.com,"Gonzalez, Benito/H-5189-2013; Estades, Cristian F/A-5221-2008; Iranzo, Esperanza C./W-1256-2019","Estades, Cristian F/0000-0002-4479-7774; Gonzalez, Benito/0000-0002-0039-5722; Iranzo, Esperanza C./0000-0001-9411-8437","Interuniversity Cooperation Program from Agencia Espanola de Cooperacion Internacional para el Desarrollo [A/016431/08, A/024945/09]; Interuniversity Cooperation Project CEAL-UAM-Santander; UAM; SAGDefence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO); Remedinal-3 research network [S-2013/MAE-2719]; Universidad de Chile; FPU grant from the Ministerio de Educacion Cultura y Deporte (Government of Spain)","This research was funded by an Interuniversity Cooperation Program from Agencia Espanola de Cooperacion Internacional para el Desarrollo (A/016431/08 and A/024945/09), Interuniversity Cooperation Project CEAL-UAM-Santander, and a Cooperation Agreement between UAM and SAG.

Here we assess whether interspecific variation in higher-order aspects of female macaque (genus: Macaca) dominance and grooming social structure show phylogenetic signals, that is, greater similarity among more closely-related species. We use a social network approach to describe higher-order characteristics of social structure, based on both direct interactions and secondary pathways that connect group members. We also ask whether network traits covary with each other, with species-typical social style grades, and/or with sociodemographic characteristics, specifically group size, sex-ratio, and current living condition (captive vs. free-living). We assembled 34-38 datasets of female-female dyadic aggression and allogrooming among captive and free-living macaques representing 10 species. We calculated dominance (transitivity, certainty), and grooming (centrality coefficient, Newman's modularity, clustering coefficient) network traits as aspects of social structure. Computations of K statistics and randomization tests on multiple phylogenies revealed moderate-strong phylogenetic signals in dominance traits, but moderate-weak signals in grooming traits. GLMMs showed that grooming traits did not covary with dominance traits and/or social style grade. Rather, modularity and clustering coefficient, but not centrality coefficient, were strongly predicted by group size and current living condition. Specifically, larger groups showed more modular networks with sparsely-connected clusters than smaller groups. Further, this effect was independent of variation in living condition, and/or sampling effort. In summary, our results reveal that female dominance networks were more phylogenetically conserved across macaque species than grooming networks, which were more labile to sociodemographic factors. Such findings narrow down the processes that influence interspecific variation in two core aspects of macaque social structure. Future directions should include using phylogeographic approaches, and addressing challenges in examining the effects of socioecological factors on primate social structure.","[Balasubramaniam, Krishna N.; Beisner, Brianne A.; McCowan, Brenda] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Vet Med, Dept Populat Hlth & Reprod, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Beisner, Brianne A.; McCowan, Brenda] Univ Calif Davis, Calif Natl Primate Res Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Berman, Carol M.] Univ Buffalo, Grad Program Evolut Ecol & Behav, Dept Anthropol, Buffalo, NY USA; [De Marco, Arianna] Fdn Ethokios, Radicondoli, Italy; [Duboscq, Julie; MacIntosh, Andrew J.] Kyoto Univ, Wildlife Res Ctr, Inuyama, Aichi, Japan; [Duboscq, Julie; MacIntosh, Andrew J.] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Inuyama, Aichi, Japan; [Koirala, Sabina] SMCRF, Kathamandu, Nepal; [Majolo, Bonaventura] Univ Lincoln, Sch Psychol, Lincoln, England; [McFarland, Richard] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Anthropol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Molesti, Sandra] Univ Toulouse Jean Jaures, Toulouse, France; [Ogawa, Hideshi] Chukyo Univ, Sch Int Liberal Studies, Toyota, Japan; [Petit, Odile; McCowan, Brenda] CNRS, Ethol Cognit & Sociale, Strasbourg, France; [Schino, Gabriele] CNR, Ist Sci & Tecnol Cogniz, Rome, Italy; [Sosa, Sebastian] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Anthropol Dept, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Sueur, Cedric; Thierry, Bernard] Univ Strasbourg, Inst Pluridisciplinaire Hubert Curien, CNRS, Strasbourg, France; [de Waal, Frans B.

Plant fitness and growth will be determined by how plants interact with each other at smaller scales. Local-scale neighbourhood interactions may be altered by environmental pertubations, which could fundamentally affect community structure. This study examined the effects of seven years of experimental warming and nutrient addition on overall changes in the community structure and patterns of interspecific interaction between neighbouring plant species in two contrasting alpine plant communities, mesic meadow and poor heath, in subarctic Sweden. We used a network approach to quantify the dissimilarity of plant interaction networks and the average number of interspecific neighbourhood interactions over time in response to different environmental perturbations. The results revealed that combined warming and nutrient addition had significant negative effects on how dissimilar plant interaction networks were over time compared with the control. Moreover, plant-plant neighbourhood interaction networks were more dissimilar over time in nutrient-poor heath than in nutrient-rich mesic meadow. In addition, nutrient addition alone and combined nutrient addition and warming significantly affected neighbourhood species interactions in both plant communities. Surprisingly, changes in interspecific neighbourhood interactions over time in both communities were very similar, suggesting that the nutrient-poor heath is as robust to experimental environmental perturbation as the mesic meadow. Comparisons of changes in neighbouring species interactions with changes in evenness and richness at the same scale, in order to determine whether diversity drove such changes in local-scale interaction patterns, provided moderate evidence that diversity was behind the changes in local-scale interspecific neighbourhood interactions. This implied that species might interact at smaller scales than those at which community measures were made. Overall, these results demonstrated that global change involving increased nutrient deposition and warming is likely to affect species interactions and alter community structure in plant communities, whether rich or poor in nutrients and species.

For example, animals eavesdrop on other animals to find profitable food resources, yet the types of cues they use and how these cues influence decisions to approach a resource remain poorly understood. In tropical systems, arthropods inadvertently flushed by army ant, Eciton burchellii, swarms are an important food resource for many bird species, which form mixed-species foraging aggregations at swarms. Competition at swarms is intense and birds vocalize to defend foraging areas, inadvertently producing acoustic social information about the swarm's location. Eavesdropping birds may use these acoustic cues, which provide information about the bird aggregation (i.e. species participating in the aggregation, the size of the aggregation and/or diversity of the aggregation) to assess potential benefits (food resources) and costs (competition for food) of joining an aggregation. To test this hypothesis, we used an acoustic playback experiment to simulate aggregations of birds foraging at ant swarms and we measured community-wide and guild-specific responses of forest birds to playbacks. We included three types of acoustic social information in playbacks that potentially interact to affect an eavesdropping bird's probability of attraction to a swarm: (1) aggregation size, (2) aggregation species richness and (3) degree of specialization on ant swarms for food of birds vocalizing in the aggregation (hereafter 'dependency'). Using Bayesian generalized linear mixed models, we found that playbacks of obligate ant-following species elicited greater community-wide responses (i.e. attracted more individuals and species) to simulated aggregations compared to playbacks of other, less dependent guilds. We also found that interactions between dependency, species richness and aggregation size influenced the overall community response to playbacks and that species from one guild generally responded to the guild above them (i.e. from less to more specialized). Our results suggest that species evaluate multiple types of acoustic cues representing the costs and benefits of foraging in a mixed-species aggregation at a swarm. We hypothesize that species change from information receivers to information producers upon joining a swarm, ultimately producing an information cascade that further affects the dynamics of feeding aggregations at swarms.

The level of polyandry (defined by the lifetime number of male mates of a female) is an important determinant of the occurrence and intensity of sexual selection acting on male phenotypes. While the forces of sexual selection acting on phenotypic male traits such as body size are relatively well understood, sexual selection acting on phenotypic plasticity of these traits is unexplored. We tackled this issue by scrutinizing the link between polyandry and phenotypic plasticity of male body size in two sympatric plant-inhabiting predatory mite species, Phytoseiulus persimilis and Neoseiulus californicus. These two species are similar in life history, ecological niche requirements, mating behavior, polygyny and female body size plasticity but strikingly differ in the level of both polyandry and phenotypic plasticity of male body size (both lower in P. persimilis). We hypothesized that deviations from standard body size, i.e. the size achieved under favorable conditions, incur higher costs for males in the less polyandrous P. persimilis. To test our hypotheses, we conducted two experiments on (i) the effects of male body size on spermatophore transfer in singly mating females and (ii) the effects of mate sequence (switching the order of standard-sized and small males) on mating behavior and paternity success in doubly mating females. In P. persimilis but not N. californicus, small males transferred fewer but larger spermatophores to the females; in both species, females re-mated more likely with standard-sized following small than small following standard-sized males; in P. persimilis, first standardsized males sired a higher proportion of offspring produced after re-mating by the female than first small males, whereas in N. californicus the paternity success of small and standard- sized males was independent of the mating sequence. Based on our results and pertinent previous studies, which showed that females of P. persimilis, but not N. californicus, prefer mating with standard-sized over small males and allow them fertilizing more eggs, the lack of interspecific difference in female body size plasticity, and the absence of any clue pointing at a role of natural selection, we suggest that the interspecific difference in male body size plasticity is sexually selected. Our study provides an indication of sexual selection constraining plasticity of male phenotypes, suggesting that the level of polyandry may be an important co-determinant of the level of phenotypic plasticity of male body size.","[Schausberger, Peter] Univ Vienna, Dept Behav Biol, Vienna, Austria; [Schausberger, Peter; Walzer, Andreas] Dept Crop Sci, Grp Arthropod Ecol & Behav, Vienna, Austria; [Murata, Yasumasa; Osakabe, Masahiro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Ecol Informat, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto, Japan","Schausberger, P (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Behav Biol, Vienna, Austria.; Schausberger, P (corresponding author), Dept Crop Sci, Grp Arthropod Ecol & Behav, Vienna, Austria.",peter.schausberger@univie.ac.at,"Osakabe, Masahiro/H-8587-2019","Osakabe, Masahiro/0000-0002-2246-3431; Schausberger, Peter/0000-0002-1529-3198","Austria Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 23504-617]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 23504, P 25876] Funding Source: researchfish","This work was financed by a grant from the Austria Science Fund (FWF; P 23504-617) to PS.

Devil populations are currently declining due to a fatal transmissible cancer. Our aim was to analyse the diet of both species across their range in Tasmania, as a basis for understanding how devil decline might affect the abundance and distribution of quolls through release from competition. We used faecal analysis to describe diets of one or both species at 13 sites across Tasmania. We compared diet composition and breadth between the two species, and tested for geographic patterns in diets related to rainfall and devil population decline. Dietary items were classified into 6 broad categories: large mammals (>= 7.0kg), medium-sized mammals (0.5-6.9kg), small mammals (<0.5kg), birds, reptiles and invertebrates. Diet overlap based on prey-size category was high. Quoll diets were broader than devils at all but one site. Devils consumed more large and medium-sized mammals and quolls more small mammals, reptiles and invertebrates. Medium-sized mammals (mainly Tasmanian pademelon Thylogale billardierii), followed by large mammals (mainly Bennett's wallaby Macropus rufogriseus) and birds, were the most important prey groups for both species. Diet composition varied across sites, suggesting that both species are flexible and opportunistic foragers, but was not related to rainfall for devils. Quolls included more large mammals but fewer small mammals and invertebrates in their diet in the eastern drier parts of Tasmania where devils have declined. This suggests that a competitive release of quolls may have occurred and the substantial decline of devils has provided more food in the large-mammal category for quolls, perhaps as increased scavenging opportunities. The high diet overlap suggests that if resources become limited in areas of high devil density, interspecific competition could occur.","[Andersen, Georgina E.; Johnson, Christopher N.; Barmuta, Leon A.; Jones, Menna E.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Biol Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Johnson, Christopher N.] Univ Tasmania, Australian Res Council, Ctr Australian Biodivers & Heritage, Hobart, Tas, Australia","Andersen, GE (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Biol Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",georgina.andersen@utas.edu.au,"Johnson, Christopher N/J-7894-2014; Barmuta, Leon/J-2413-2013; CABAH, ARC/T-6419-2019","Johnson, Christopher N/0000-0002-9719-3771; Barmuta, Leon/0000-0002-8946-3727; Andersen, Georgina/0000-0001-9425-8296; Jones, Menna/0000-0001-7558-9022",Australian Research Council Discovery Scheme grant [DP110103069]; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Save the Tasmanian Devil Appeal [F3F98304778C800ECA2576CB007D1E6B],"This research was funded by grants from the Australian Research Council Discovery Scheme grant (DP110103069) to MEJ and CNJ, the Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment (http://www.ecolsoc.org.au/endowments) and a Dr Eric Guiler Tasmanian Devil Research grant from the Save the Tasmanian Devil Appeal (http://www.tassiedevil.com.au/tasdevil.nsf/Grants-&-scholarships/F3F98304778C800ECA2576CB007D1E6B) to GEA.

Because it is difficult to identify seed hoarders and pilferers under field conditions by traditional methods, the full costs incurred and benefits accrued by scatter-hoarding have not been fully evaluated in most systems. By using infrared radiation camera tracking and seed tagging, we investigated the benefits and losses of scatter-hoarded seeds (Camellia oleifera) for 3 sympatric rodent species (Apodemus draco, Niviventer confucianus and Leopoldamys edwardsi) in a subtropical forest of Southwest China during 2013 to 2015. We established the relationships between the rodents and the seeds at the individual level. For each rodent species, we calculated the cache recovery rate of cache owners, as well as conspecific and interspecific pilferage rates. We found that all 3 sympatric rodent species had a cache recovery advantage with rates that far exceeded average pilferage rates over a 30-day tracking period. The smallest species (A. draco) showed the highest rate of scatter-hoarding and the highest recovery advantage compared with the other 2 larger species (N. confucianus and L. edwardsi). Our results suggest that scatter-hoarding benefits cache owners in food competition, supporting the pilferage avoidance hypothesis. Therefore, scatter-hoarding behavior should be favored by natural selection, and plays a significant role in species coexistence of rodent community and in the formation of mutualism between seeds and rodents in forest ecosystems.","[Gu, Haifeng; Zhang, Zhibin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Gu, Haifeng; Zhao, Qingjian] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhangzb@ioz.ac.cn,,,"Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB11050300, KSZD-EW-TZ-008]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31330013]","We thank Zhishu Xiao, Hongmao Zhang, Xianfeng Yi, Chuan Yan, Lin Cao and Xinru Wan for technical support; Xifu Yang, Wenhua Xie and Chengqiang Wang for field assistance; Stephen Vander Wall, Patrick Jansen, Michael Steele, Marcel Holyoak and Guiming Wang for comments that helped improve the manuscript; and the Subalpine Mountain Plant Garden of West China, CAS and the Forest Bureau of Dujiangyan City of Sichuan Province for support through the use of facilities.

In this review, I examine these relationships in non-human primates. Because most existing theoretical models of the evolution of sex roles focus on the evolutionary origins of sex-biased behaviour, they offer only a general scaffold for predicting variation in sex roles among and within species. I argue that studies examining sex role variation at these more specific levels need to take social organization into account to identify meaningful levels for the measurement of ASR and to account for the fact that ASR and sex roles mutually influence each other. Moreover, taxon-specific life-history traits can constrain sex role flexibility and impact the operational sex ratio (OSR) by specifying the minimum length of female time outs from reproduction. Using examples from the primate literature, I highlight practical problems in estimating ASR and OSR. I then argue that interspecific variation in the occurrence of indirect forms of paternal care might indeed be linked to variation in ASR. Some studies also indicate that female aggression and bonding, as well as components of intersexual relationships, are sensitive to variation in ASR. Thus, links between primate sex roles and sex ratios merit further study, and such studies could prompt the development of more specific theoretical models that make realistic assumptions about taxon-specific life history and social organization.","[Kappeler, Peter M.] Wissensch Kolleg Berlin, Wallotstr 19, D-14193 Berlin, Germany; [Kappeler, Peter M.] German Primate Ctr, Behav Ecol & Sociobiol Unit, Kellnerweg 4, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Kappeler, Peter M.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Sociobiol Anthropol, Kellnerweg 6, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Kappeler, PM (corresponding author), Wissensch Kolleg Berlin, Wallotstr 19, D-14193 Berlin, Germany.; Kappeler, PM (corresponding author), German Primate Ctr, Behav Ecol & Sociobiol Unit, Kellnerweg 4, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.; Kappeler, PM (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Sociobiol Anthropol, Kellnerweg 6, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",pkappel@gwdg.de,,,,,,190,18,18,4,100,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8436,1471-2970,,PHILOS T R SOC B,Philos.

This reorganization can also be associated with the extent to which species change their preference for types of niches available in their local sites. Despite the pervasiveness of these interaction changes, previous studies have revealed that network reorganizations have a minimal or insignificant effect on global descriptors of network architecture, such as connectance, modularity and nestedness. However, little is known about whether these reorganizations may have an effect on community dynamics and composition. To answer the question above, we study the multi-year dynamics and reorganization of plant-herbivore interaction networks across secondary successional stages of a tropical dry forest. We develop new quantitative tools based on a structural stability approach to estimate the potential impact of network reorganization on species persistence. Then, we investigate whether this impact can explain the likelihood of persistence of herbivore species in the observed communities. We find that resident (early-arriving) herbivore species increase their likelihood of persistence across time and successional stages. Importantly, we demonstrate that, in late successional stages, the reorganization of interactions among resident species has a strong inhibitory effect on the likelihood of persistence of colonizing (late-arriving) herbivores. These findings support earlier predictions suggesting that, in mature communities, changes of species interactions can act as community-control mechanisms (also known as priority effects). Furthermore, our results illustrate that the dynamics and composition of ecological communities cannot be fully understood without attention to their reorganization processes, despite the invariability of global network properties.","[Saavedra, Serguei; Cenci, Simone] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [del-Val, Ek] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Ecosistemas & Sustentabilidad, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico; [Boege, Karina] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Rohr, Rudolf P.] Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol Ecol & Evolut, Fribourg, Switzerland","Saavedra, S (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",sersaa@mit.edu,"Rohr, Rudolf Philippe/K-9232-2015; Cenci, Simone/AAH-8346-2021; Pare, Karina Boege/AAP-9596-2021; del val, Ek/AAB-8343-2019","Rohr, Rudolf Philippe/0000-0002-6440-2696; Cenci, Simone/0000-0001-6843-468X; ","MIT Research Committee Funds; UNAM-PAPIITPrograma de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [IN217507, IN208610]","Funding was provided by MIT Research Committee Funds (SS), UNAM-PAPIIT IN217507 and IN208610 (EdV and KB).

Do grass and forb species differ in the degree of intraspecific trait variation? Location: Managed grasslands in three regions of Germany. Methods: Using a phytometer approach, we raised 20 common European grassland species (ten forbs and ten grasses) and planted them into 54 plots of different land-use types (pasture, meadow, mown pasture). After 1yr in the field, we measured above- and below-ground plant functional traits. Linear mixed effects models (LMEM) were used to identify the most powerful predictors for every trait. Variation partitioning was applied to assess the amount of inter- and intraspecific trait variation in grasses and forbs explained by environmental conditions (land-use intensity, climate and soil conditions) and plant species diversity of the local neighbourhood. Results: For 12 out of the 14 traits studied, either land-use intensity or local neighbourhood diversity were predictors in the best LMEM. Land-use intensity had considerably stronger effects than neighbourhood diversity. Root dry matter content and root phosphorus concentration of forbs were more affected by land-use intensity than those of grasses. For almost all traits, intraspecific trait variation of grasses was much higher than that of forbs, while traits of forbs varied more among species. Overall, inter- and intraspecific variation was of the same magnitude. Conclusion: The similar magnitude of intra- and interspecific trait variation suggests that both sources should be considered in grassland studies at a scale similar to that of our study. The high amount of intraspecific trait variation that was explained by environmental factors and local neighbourhood diversity clearly demonstrates the high potential of species to adjust to local conditions, which would be ignored when only considering species mean trait values.","[Herz, Katharina; Haider, Sylvia; Jandt, Ute; Bruelheide, Helge] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Dietz, Sophie; Scheel, Dierk] Leibniz Inst Plant Biochem, Weinberg 3, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Haider, Sylvia; Jandt, Ute; Scheel, Dierk; Bruelheide, Helge] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Herz, K (corresponding author), Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Biol Geobot & Bot Garden, Kirchtor 1, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.",katharina.herz@botanik.uni-halle.de; sophie.nahrstedt@ipb-halle.de; sylvia.haider@botanik.uni-halle.de; ute.jandt@botanik.uni-halle.de; dierk.scheel@ipb-halle.de; helge.bruelheide@botanik.uni-halle.de,"Haider, Sylvia/M-2990-2014; Jandt, Ute/S-7886-2016; Bruelheide, Helge/G-3907-2013","Haider, Sylvia/0000-0002-2966-0534; Jandt, Ute/0000-0002-3177-3669; Bruelheide, Helge/0000-0003-3135-0356","DFG Priority Program Infrastructure-Biodiversity-ExploratoriesGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [BR 1698/11-3, 1374]","We thank the managers of the three Exploratories, Kirsten Reichel-Jung, Katrin Lorenzen, Martin Gorke and all former managers for their work in maintaining the plot and project infrastructure; Christiane Fischer for giving support through the central office, Michael Owonibi for managing the central database, and Markus Fischer, Eduard Linsenmair, Dominik Hessenmoller, Jens Nieschulze, Daniel Prati, Ingo Schoning, Francois Buscot, Ernst-Detlef Schulze, Wolfgang W.

However, the genetic basis for variation in UV patterning is largely unknown. This study examines the genetic architecture for proportional and absolute size of the UV bullseye in Helianthus argophyllus, a close relative of the domesticated sunflower. Methods A camera modified to capture UV light (320-380 nm) was used to phenotype floral UV patterning in an F-2 mapping population, then quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified using genotyping-by-sequencing and linkage mapping. The ability of these QTL to predict the UV patterning of natural population individuals was also assessed. Key Results Proportional UV pigmentation is additively controlled by six moderate effect QTL that are predictive of this phenotype in natural populations. In contrast, UV bullseye size is controlled by a single large effect QTL that also controls flowerhead size and co-localizes with a major flowering time QTL in Helianthus. Conclusions The co-localization of the UV bullseye size QTL, flowerhead size QTL and a previously known flowering time QTL may indicate a single highly pleiotropic locus or several closely linked loci, which could inhibit UV bullseye size from responding to selection without change in correlated characters. The genetic architecture of proportional UV pigmentation is relatively simple and different from that of UV bullseye size, and so should be able to respond to natural or artificial selection independently.","[Moyers, Brook T.; Owens, Gregory L.; Baute, Gregory J.; Rieseberg, Loren H.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Room 3529-6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Moyers, Brook T.; Owens, Gregory L.; Baute, Gregory J.; Rieseberg, Loren H.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Room 3529-6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Moyers, Brook T.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Bioagr Sci & Pest Management, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Moyers, BT (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Room 3529-6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.; Moyers, BT (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Room 3529-6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.; Moyers, BT (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Bioagr Sci & Pest Management, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",brook.moyers@gmail.com,"Rieseberg, Loren H/B-3591-2013; Moyers, Brook T./E-1516-2012","Rieseberg, Loren H/0000-0002-2712-2417; Moyers, Brook T./0000-0003-0340-9488; Owens, Gregory/0000-0002-4019-5215",Genome CanadaGenome Canada; Genome BC,"We thank Glenn Cole, Suzie Snyder and others at Pioneer for assistance with fieldwork and data collection, Jerold Chu for assistance with UV photography measurements, and Alexandra Paquet and Ada Roman for assistance with DNA extraction and GBS library preparation.

Previous population dynamics models have assumed that the impact of frequency-dependent reproductive interference depends on the relative abundances of species. However, this assumption could be an oversimplification inappropriate for making quantitative predictions. Therefore, a more general model to forecast population dynamics in the presence of reproductive interference is required. Here we developed a population dynamics model to describe the absolute density dependence of reproductive interference, which appears likely when encounter rate between individuals is important. Our model (i) can produce diverse shapes of isoclines depending on parameter values and (ii) predicts weaker reproductive interference when absolute density is low. These novel characteristics can create conditions where coexistence is stable and independent from the initial conditions. We assessed the utility of our model in an empirical study using an experimental pair of seed beetle species, Callosobruchus maculatus and Callosobruchus chinensis. Reproductive interference became stronger with increasing total beetle density even when the frequencies of the two species were kept constant.

Interactions between carnivore species have important implications for direct interference competition, cross-species transmission of shared pathogens and conservation threats to wild carnivores. However, carnivore intraguild interactions are hard to quantify. In this study, we asked 512 villagers residing around a conservation area in the Serengeti Ecosystem, Tanzania, to report on the presence of wild carnivores in their village, the number of domestic dogs Canis familiaris and cats Felis catus in their household and interactions between domestic and wild carnivores. Wild carnivores are abundant near households surrounding the Serengeti National Park, villagers have many free-ranging domestic dogs (and would like to have more) and direct and indirect contacts between wild and domestic carnivores are common. Large carnivores, such as spotted hyenas and leopards, often killed or wounded domestic dogs. Small carnivores, such as mongoose, bat-eared fox, serval and wildcat, are locally abundant and frequently interact with domestic dogs. We demonstrate that interspecific carnivore behavior, human culture and local and regional geography play a complex role in domestic and wild carnivore interaction risk around conservation areas. Through the use of household surveys, we were able to efficiently obtain data on a wide scope of carnivore interactions over a large area, which may provide a direction for future targeted and in-depth research to reduce interspecific conflict. Improving the health and husbandry of domestic animals and reducing the unintentional feeding of wild carnivores could reduce dog-wildlife interactions and the potential for pathogen transmission at the domestic-wild animal interface.","[Craft, M.

Currently, few field studies have evaluated the long-term effects of extreme precipitation on forest ecosystems based on tree physiology. To provide a better mechanistic understanding of these effects, a two-year Precipitation Seasonal Distribution Changes experiment (PSDC) was conducted in lower subtropical China. The treatments included Drier dry season and wetter wet season (DD), 'Extended dry season and wetter wet season (ED) and  Ambient control (AC)'. The throughfall of the DD treatment was excluded during the dry season (October-March of the following year) to simulate drought, whereas the throughfall of the ED treatment was excluded in the spring (April-May) to simulate spring drought without significant altering the total annual precipitation input. The sap flow, water use efficiency, leaf and wood nutrient content and morphological parameters of two co-occurring tree species, Michelia macclurei Dandy and Schima superba Gardner & Champ., were quantified to elucidate the physiological mechanisms that occur in response to rainfall pattern changes. Our results indicated that the whole-tree transpiration per unit sapwood area (J(s)) and intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) showed homeostatic responses. Tree transpiration and response parameters to environmental variables (vapor pressure deficit [VPD] and photosynthetically active radiation [PAR]) did not show significant treatment effects regardless of drought, spring drought or irrigation periods. However, the leaf nitrogen (N-area) and phosphorus (P-area) content showed fluctuations, particularly the leaf N:P ratio, which showed that rainfall pattern changes had adverse effects on nutrient acquisition in this dual nitrogen-and phosphorus-limited forest ecosystem. The wood stoichiometry was more conserved than the leaf stoichiometry. For a given leaf C-13 discrimination (approximate to c(i)/c(a)), the wood C-13 discrimination did not show treatment or species effects, suggesting that the carbon transfer of trees was not affected by rainfall patterns. The branch As:A(l) was significantly negatively correlated with the parameters representing the sensitivity of tree transpiration to VPD, indicating that the trees maintained homeostatic responses by combining stomatal control and morphological adjustments. In mesic environments, the two studied tree species showed high resilience to seasonal rainfall pattern changes and homeostatic responses to nutrient acquisition, light use and water uptake, which is consistent with the 'ecohydrological equilibrium theory'. In conclusion, the shallow-rooted M. macclurei presented a growth advantage in mesic environments or under mild water stress, whereas the deeply rooted S. superba is more competitive under predicted prolonged drought scenarios, such as DD and ED rain patterns, because of its greater morphological plasticity and increased water uptake from groundwater. Both species are common in south and eastern China but present inherently different responses to seasonal precipitation changes, which implies that changes in the timing and magnitude of precipitation may have consequences for plant nutrient acquisition and water balance and the potential to alter community composition.

Most studies that quantify population niche widths and associated levels of IS typically focus on a single or few species, but studies examining NVH in a phylogenetically informed comparative analysis among species are lacking. Here we use nitrogen isotope (delta N-15) analysis to measure population niche widths and IS in a single bird community composed of 12 passerine species representing different foraging guilds. We found support for the NVH at the interspecific level; species with broader population niche widths were comprised of more individual specialists. Moreover, our results suggest that this relationship is influenced by foraging guild; specifically, omnivores have higher degrees of IS for a given population niche width than insectivores. Finally, the levels of IS among passerine species, in contrast to population niche width, were associated with their relatedness, suggesting that the potential phylogenetic effect on the prevalence of IS is higher than previously recognized.","[Maldonado, Karin; Sabat, Pablo] Univ Chile, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Bozinovic, Francisco; Sabat, Pablo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecolog & Ctr Appl Ecol Sustainabil CAPES, Santiago 6513677, Chile; [Newsome, Seth D.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Maldonado, K (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Santiago, Chile.",psabat@uchile.cl,,,"FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1120276, 1160115, FB0002-2014]","We thank Andres Sazo for assistance in field work and two anonymous reviewer for their valuable comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

We obtained sequential delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in dentine from canine teeth of specimens found along the southern Brazilian coast. We calculated isotopic niches where axes were used as a surrogate for trophic (delta N-15) and spatial (delta C-13) dimensions of the ecological niche. Further, we adjusted generalized additive mixed models to chronological data of delta C-13 and delta N-15 to investigate the ontogenetic variation of the isotopic niche. The three species showed significant segregation in both spatial and the trophic dimensions as a result of foraging at different latitudes. Within A. australis, males occupied higher trophic positions than females. Furthermore, some isotopic niche overlap was found between sexes in A. tropicalis and A. gazella, though sample sizes preclude conclusive interpretation. Marked ontogenetic variation in the isotopic niche, especially in the early years, was observed in all species. Isotopic niche suggest that intra-and interspecific competition in these otariids is minimized by different degrees of spatial and trophic segregation.","[de Albernaz, Thaise Lima; Secchi, Eduardo R.; Botta, Silvina] Lab Ecol & Conservacao Megafauna Marinha ECOMEGA, Ave Italia Km 8 S-N, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; [de Oliveira, Larissa Rosa] Univ Vale do Rio dos Sinos, Lab Ecol Mamiferos, Ave Unisinos 950, BR-93022750 Sao Leopoldo, RS, Brazil; [de Oliveira, Larissa Rosa] Grp Estudos Mamiferos Aquat Rio Grande do Sul, Rua Machado de Assis 1456, BR-95520000 Osorio, RS, Brazil","Botta, S (corresponding author), Lab Ecol & Conservacao Megafauna Marinha ECOMEGA, Ave Italia Km 8 S-N, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.",silbotta@gmail.com,"Secchi, Eduardo R./ABF-1191-2020; botta, silvina/D-7528-2016","Secchi, Eduardo R./0000-0001-9087-9909; Botta, Silvina/0000-0001-6219-6932; Oliveira, Larissa/0000-0002-5735-3697",CAPES/AuxPe; Yaqu Pacha (Germany); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq (Brazil)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [PQ 307846/2014-8]; CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),"We are indebted to all researchers and volunteers from the ECOMEGA-IO-FURG.

The results of the co-occurrence analysis revealed that the species' associations are structured, meaning that at different kinds of Branchinecta habitats, the associated species are different. I did not find niche sharing, which means interspecific competition is absent. Finally the size overlap analysis revealed structured patterns, which are probably due to environmental homogeneity or colonization extinction processes. The habitats studied are shallow ephemeral pools, with extreme environmental conditions, where continuous local colonization and extinction processes probably occur, which would explain the marked Branchinecta species endemism.","[De los Rios Escalante, Patricio] Univ Catolica Temuco, Fac Recursos Nat, Escuela Ciencias Ambientales, Casilla 15-D, Temuco, Chile; [De los Rios Escalante, Patricio] UC Temuco, Nucleo Estudios Ambientales, Temuco, Chile","Escalante, PD (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Temuco, Fac Recursos Nat, Escuela Ciencias Ambientales, Casilla 15-D, Temuco, Chile.; Escalante, PD (corresponding author), UC Temuco, Nucleo Estudios Ambientales, Temuco, Chile.",prios@uct.cl,"De los Rios-Escalante, Patricio/E-2775-2014","De los Rios-Escalante, Patricio/0000-0001-5056-7003",project Tides Grant Foundation [TRF13-03011 MECESUP UCT 0804]; Research Direction of the Catholic University of Temuco,The present study was funded by the project Tides Grant Foundation TRF13-03011 MECESUP UCT 0804 and the Research Direction of the Catholic University of Temuco.

Plant exploitation, the simplest level, is the use of plant defence chemicals for the benefit of insects. It is illustrated by the use of plant toxins for defence against predators. The energetic cost of that defence strategy is discussed according to the toxicity of the chemicals and the necessity of protecting the herbivore, and the modes of action on predators are presented. Furthermore, manipulation of the plant can reorient the plant metabolism to satisfy insect needs. Drastic remodelling of the host plant can occur, from ultrastructure to anatomy levels, with alteration of both its nutritional quality and secondary metabolism. The mechanisms involved are being investigated. Outcomes concern optimization of the nutritional value of the host plant and protection fromadverse abiotic and biotic (natural enemies, competition) conditions. Cooperation with conspecifics or microorganisms often interferes. At the highest level of complexity, mutualism is the result of a compromise between insect and plant where each partner benefits from the association. Pollination is a typical example. Pollinators vary from generalists to specialists and belong to a community of insect linked to a community of plants. In the figefig wasp mutualism, the various mechanisms involved in situations of monoecy and dioecy are discussed, as well as the existence of coadaptations and cospeciations. The chapter ends with a presentation of research perspectives for improving crop productivity.","[Lieutier, F.; Salle, A.] Univ Orleans, INRA, Lab Biol Ligneux & Grandes Cultures, Orleans, France; [Bermudez-Torres, K.] Natl Polytech Inst, Yautepec, Mexico; [Cook, J.] Western Sydney Univ, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Harris, M.

We aimed to investigate trait divergence linked to pollinator attraction and reproductive isolation (RI) in two hummingbird-pollinated and bird-dispersed Psittacanthus species with range overlap. Methods: We investigated the phylogenetic relationships, floral biology, pollinator assemblages, seed dispersers and host usage, and the breeding system and female reproductive success of two sympatric populations of P. calyculatus and P. auriculatus, and one allopatric population of P. calyculatus. Flowers in sympatry were also reciprocally pollinated to assess a post-mating component of RI. Results: Hummingbird assemblages differed between calyculatus populations, while allopatric plants of calyculatus opened more but smaller flowers with longer lifespans and produced less nectar than those in sympatry. Bayesian-based phylogenetic analysis indicated monophyly for calyculatus populations (i.e. both populations belong to the same species). In sympatry, calyculatus plants opened more and larger flowers with longer lifespans and produced same nectar volume than those of auriculatus; populations shared pollinators but seed dispersers and host usage differed between species. Nectar standing crops differed between sympatric populations, with lower visitation in calyculatus. Hand pollination experiments indicated a predominant outcrossing breeding system, with fruit set after interspecific pollination two times higher from calyculatus to auriculatus than in the opposite direction. Conclusions: Given the low genetic differentiation between calyculatus populations, observed trait divergence could have resulted from changes regarding the local communities of pollinators and, therefore, expected divergence for peripheral, allopatric populations. Using RI estimates, there were fewer heterospecific matings than expected by chance in P. calyculatus (RI4A = 0.629) as compared to P. auriculatus (RI4A = 0.20). When considering other factors of ecological isolation that affect co-occurrence, the RI4C values indicate that isolation by hummingbird pollinators was less effective (0.20) than isolation by host tree species and seed dispersers (0.80 and 0.60, respectively), suggesting that host usage is the most important ecological isolation factor between the two species. Accordingly, the absolute and relative cumulative strength values indicated that the host tree species' barrier is currently contributing the most to maintaining these species in sympatry.","[Diaz Infante, Sergio; del Coro Arizmendi, Maria] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, UBIPRO, Lab Ecol, Fac Estudios Super Iztacala, Tlalnepantla De Baz, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Lara, Carlos] Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, Ctr Invest Ciencias Biol, Tlaxcala, Mexico; [Eguiarte, Luis E.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Evolut, Ciudad De Mexico, DF, Mexico; [Francisco Ornelas, Juan] Inst Ecol AC, Dept Biol Evolut, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico","Ornelas, JF (corresponding author), Inst Ecol AC, Dept Biol Evolut, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico.",francisco.ornelas@inecol.mx,"Ornelas, Juan Francisco/A-2250-2014","Ornelas, Juan Francisco/0000-0002-1124-1163","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [155686]; Departamento de Biologia Evolutiva, INECOL [20030/10563]; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) PAPIIT [IN217511, IN216514]; CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)","This project was funded by research funds from a competitive grant (155686) from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) awarded to J.F.O., the Departamento de Biologia Evolutiva, INECOL to J.F.O.

This represents an essential change in direction to more accurately understand how and why microorganisms assemble into communities, as well as the functional implications for such a life style. For example, current research studies shows that communities display emergent properties or functions that are not predicted from the individual single species populations, including elevated stress tolerance and resistance to antibiotics. Models for mixed species biofilms can be very simple, comprised only a handful of species or can be extremely species rich, with hundreds or thousands of species present. The future holds much promise for this area of research, where investigators will increasingly be able to resolve, at the molecular and biochemical levels, interspecies relationships and mechanisms of interaction.

The role of bacterial community composition in determining ecosystem functioning depends critically on interactions among bacterial taxa. Several studies have shown that, despite a predominance of negative interactions in communities, bacteria are able to display positive interactions given the appropriate evolutionary or ecological conditions. We were interested in how interspecific interactions develop over time in a naturalistic setting of low resource supply rates. We assembled aquatic bacterial communities in microcosms and assayed the productivity (respiration and growth) and substrate degradation while tracking community composition. The results demonstrated that while bacterial communities displayed strongly negative interactions during the early phase of colonisation and acclimatisation to novel biotic and abiotic factors, this antagonism declined over time towards a more neutral state. This was associated with a shift from use of labile substrates in early succession to use of recalcitrant substrates later in succession, confirming a crucial role of resource dynamics in linking interspecific interactions with ecosystem functioning.","[Rivett, Damian W.; Scheuerl, Thomas; Culbert, Christopher T.; Mombrikotb, Shorok B.; Johnstone, Emma; Barraclough, Timothy G.; Bell, Thomas] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Rivett, DW (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",d.rivett@imperial.ac.uk,"Rivett, Damian/H-6491-2019; Scheuerl, Thomas/AAC-6358-2020","Rivett, Damian/0000-0002-1852-6137; Scheuerl, Thomas/0000-0001-5216-5630; Barraclough, Timothy/0000-0002-8084-2640","ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [311399]; Royal Society UniversityRoyal Society of London; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/K006215/1]; BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/K006215/1, 1239681] Funding Source: researchfish",We thank Rob Griffiths (CEH) for use of his facilities.

Quantity of pollinator visits to a native may increase, decrease, or change nonlinearly, while visit quality is likely to decrease with greater interspecific pollen movement. How visit quantity and quality contribute to the effect on reproductive success at each invasion stage has not been measured. METHODS: We simulated four stages of invasion by Brassica nigra by manipulating the neighborhood of potted plants of the native Phacelia parryi in a field experiment. Stages were far from the invasion, near the invasion, intermixed with the invasive at low density, and intermixed at high density. We measured pollinator visitation, conspecific and invasive pollen deposition, and seed set for P. parryi at each stage. KEY RESULTS: Native individuals near invasive plants and within areas of low invasive density showed greatest seed production, as expected from concurrent changes in conspecific and invasive pollen deposition. Those plants experienced facilitation of visits and received more conspecific pollen relative to plants farther from invasives. Native individuals within high invasive density also received frequent visits by many pollinators (although not honeybees), but the larger receipt of invasive pollen predicted interference with pollen tubes that matched patterns in seed set. CONCLUSIONS: Pollinator visitation was highest when exotic plants were nearby. Detrimental effects of heterospecific pollen deposition were highest at high exotic density. Our study quantified how reproduction benefits from near proximity to a showy invasive, but is still vulnerable when the invasive reaches high density.","[Bruckman, Daniela; Campbell, Diane R.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Campbell, DR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",drcampbe@uci.edu,"Campbell, Diane/A-1653-2012","Campbell, Diane/0000-0002-1147-846X",Center for Environmental Biology at UC Irvine,"The authors thank D.

In mixed stands, interspecific interactions among trees can cause changes in tree performances. Nevertheless, these interactions are context dependent (cf. stress-gradient hypothesis, SGH). We thus investigated how intraspecific functional changes in leaf trait (19 traits) of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) were influenced by stand composition. We compared pure beech stands with four mixed stands containing from one to three additional tree species along a gradient of edaphic stress (gradient of soil water-holding capacity and rooting depth). First, we demonstrated that stand composition induced strong intraspecific leaf trait variation in beech for LDMC, LMA, phenolic compounds, leaf pH and magnesium concentration, suggesting higher nutrient acquisition by more diverse stands. Nevertheless, these results were modulated by edaphic stress. Mixed stands only conferred an advantage in relatively stressed sites (luvisol and leptosol). Besides, the addition of oak to beech stands had unexpected negative effects in sites with less severe stress (cambisol) as indicated by the null or positive LogRR of LMA, LDMC and phenolics. This study found that stand composition is an important though often-overlooked driver of intraspecific variability in leaf quality, and potentially reflects changes in beech tree physiology and productivity. Our results also suggest that positive interactions prevail in sites with stressful conditions. Such validation of the SGH is rare in natural or managed mature forests. Lastly, we strongly recommend that forest managers consider stand composition and abiotic factors when implementing forest growth models to improve their yield predictions.","[Forey, Estelle; Langlois, Estelle; Lapa, Gauthier; Aubert, Michael] Univ Rouen, UFR Sci & Tech, Normandie Univ, Ecodiv URA EA 1293,IRSTEA,SFR Scale 4116, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France; [Lapa, Gauthier] Univ Corse Pasquale Paoli, UMR SPE CNRS 6134, F-20250 Corte, France; [Korboulewsky, Nathalie] Irstea UR EFNO, F-45290 Nogent Sur Vernisson, France; [Robson, T.

Nevertheless, empirical investigations of these diversity effects in newly created habitats remain rare at both the genetic and species level, especially for animal systems. To test this theory we conducted a field experiment in which initial stocking diversity (both intra-and interspecific) of freshwater zooplankton in newly constructed pools was manipulated in a 2 x 2 fully factorial design. Zooplankton communities were sampled every 2 weeks from May to August in 2011 and 2012, and once in May of 2013 and 2014. Estimates of overland dispersal were measured in 2012. Despite theoretical predictions, we found no difference in taxonomic richness among stocking treatments after 4 yr. A total of 24 species was recorded in the experimental pool metacommunity, with average cumulative taxonomic richness ranging from 6.1 to 7.6 species per pool. Using dispersal traps, we found that dispersal of zooplankton was rapid, with eight taxa dispersing within 7 cl; we found no difference in the number of dispersed propagules based on number of neighboring source pools. Despite theoretical predictions regarding diversity and community assembly, our study suggests that initial diversity may have no effect on early successional community species richness.","[Holmes, Christopher J.; Caceres, Carla E.] Univ Illinois, Dept Anim Biol, Sch Integrat Biol, 515 Morrill Hall,505 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Figary, Stephanie; Schulz, Kimberly L.] SUNY Syracuse, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA","Holmes, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Anim Biol, Sch Integrat Biol, 515 Morrill Hall,505 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",cholmes@life.illinois.edu,,"Figary, Stephanie/0000-0002-4876-9850","United States National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0947314, DEB-0947245, DEB-1120804]; Sigma XI GIAR; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign School of Integrative Biology; Department of Animal Biology","We thank our undergraduate research assistants, Ilona Mend, Kelly Hogan, Glynn Davis, Ping Lee, Hannah Wright, Rachel Abbott, Chad Walz, Rachael Welter, and Ryan Smith for their field and laboratory assistance on this project.

Using 'Ashmole's halo' hypothesis of food depletion around colonies, we predict that foraging range imposes a ceiling on the maximum colony size of seabird species. We tested this with a phylogenetic comparative study of 43 species of seabirds (28 262 colonies), and investigated the interspecific correlation between colony size and foraging ranges. Foraging range showed weak relationships with the low percentiles of colony size of species, but the strength of the association increased for larger percentiles, peaking at the maximum colony sizes. To model constraints on the functional relationship between the focal traits, we applied a quantile regression based on maximum colony size. This showed that foraging range imposes a constraint to species' maximum colony sizes with a slope around 2. This second-order relationship is expected from the equation of the area of a circle. Thus, our large dataset and innovative statistical approach shows that foraging range imposes a ceiling on seabird colony sizes, providing strong support to the hypothesis that food availability is an important regulator of seabird populations.","[Jovani, Roger; Garamszegi, Laszlo Zsolt] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Ave Americo Vespucio S-N, ES-41092 Seville, Spain; [Lascelles, Ben] BirdLife Int, Girton Rd, Cambridge CB3 0NA, England; [Mavor, Roddy] JNCC, Seabird Monitoring Programme, Inverdee House,Baxter St, Aberdeen AB11 1QA, Scotland; [Thaxter, Chris B.] British Trust Ornithol, Thetford IP24 2PU, Norfolk, England; [Oro, Daniel] UIB, CSIC, Inst Mediterrani Estudis Avancats IMEDEA, Miquel Marques 21, ES-07190 Esporles, Mallorca, Spain","Jovani, R (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Ave Americo Vespucio S-N, ES-41092 Seville, Spain.",jovani@ebd.csic.es,"Garamszegi, Laszlo/M-1488-2015; Oro, Daniel/H-4208-2012; Thaxter, Chris/J-4787-2017; Jovani, Roger/C-7080-2013","Garamszegi, Laszlo/0000-0001-8920-2183; Oro, Daniel/0000-0003-4782-3007; Thaxter, Chris/0000-0003-0341-4199; Jovani, Roger/0000-0002-8693-9742","Ramon y Cajal from the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [RYC-2009-03967]; Spanish governmentSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2012- 38262, CGL2012-40026-C02-01]","Jean-Francois Rail and Shawn W.

Recent studies have developed coevolutionary theory of mutualisms, which coupled population and evolutionary dynamics, to resolve the longstanding puzzle. However, earlier studies assumed a time-scale separation between these dynamics, leaving an unanswered question of how a relaxation in the time-scale separation affects the coevolutionary dynamics of mutualism. Here I relax the strong assumption to theoretically show that ecological and evolutionary dynamics occurring in a similar time scale can stabilize an otherwise unstable mutualism. I show that the coevolutionary dynamics can cause a stable limit cycle or stable equilibrium in the population sizes, even if the population sizes increase unbounded in the absence of evolutionary adaptation. In contrast, coevolution can also cause stable limit cycle even if the population dynamics is stable in the absence of evolutionary adaptation. Furthermore, the model predicts that the population dynamics is likely to converge to equilibrium when the evolutionary speed of two species is similar and fast or highly dissimilar. The results suggest that the ease of the evolutionary 'arms race' is of crucial importance to maintain mutualism.","[Mougi, Akihiko] Shimane Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fac Life & Environm Sci, 1060 Nishikawatsu Cho, Matsue, Shimane 6908504, Japan","Mougi, A (corresponding author), Shimane Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fac Life & Environm Sci, 1060 Nishikawatsu Cho, Matsue, Shimane 6908504, Japan.",amougi@gmail.com,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25840164]; faculty of Life and Environmental Science in Shimane University",This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (#25840164) of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

However, there is still no agreement on how facilitation changes as conditions become increasingly severe. The classic stress gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts a monotonic increase in facilitation, which rises in frequency as conditions approach the extreme end of the environmental gradient. However, few studies have evaluated the validity of the SGH at the community level, the level at which it was formulated. Moreover, few studies have tested the SGH at either extreme of the gradient, and very few have excluded the effect of livestock on community response to stress. In line with the SGH, we hypothesized that several spatial pattern summary statistics would change monotonically from the least to the most arid sites, indicating increasingly aggregated patterns. In this study, we performed an evaluation of the SGH both within communities of shrub species and across a large portion of the Atacama Desert, and we isolated the abiotic component of the SGH. Our environmental gradient covered an extreme aridity gradient (<20-130 mm annual precipitation). To perform point pattern analysis, we established 13 sites with environmental conditions representing four distinct levels of this gradient. Further, we conducted species co-occurrence analyses at 19 sites along the gradient. Both sets of analyses showed stronger positive spatial associations among plants at the most extreme end of the gradient. This was true regardless of whether we included all individuals, only small individuals located around large ones, or individuals in species pairs. Moreover, species tended to show greater co-occurrence as environmental severity increased. This increase in aggregation in the plant community seems to correlate with an increase in the strength of positive interspecific interactions, rather than greater clustering within each species. These monotonic increases in species co-occurrence and spatial association in more severe environments are consistent with some of the predictions of SGH, and collectively these results suggest that as the climate becomes more arid, positive species pairs interactions tend to be prevalent in the community.","[Pablo Lopez, Ramiro; Squeo, Francisco A.; Armas, Cristina; Gutierrez, Julio R.] Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, Campus Univ,Ave Raul Bitran 1305, La Serena, Chile; [Pablo Lopez, Ramiro] Herbario Nacl Bolivia, Campus Univ,Calle 27, La Paz, Bolivia; [Squeo, Francisco A.; Armas, Cristina; Gutierrez, Julio R.] CEAZA, La Serena, Chile; [Squeo, Francisco A.; Gutierrez, Julio R.] IEB, Santiago, Chile; [Armas, Cristina] CSIC, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Almeria, Spain; [Kelt, Douglas A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, 1081 Acad Surge,One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Lopez, RP (corresponding author), Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, Campus Univ,Ave Raul Bitran 1305, La Serena, Chile.; Lopez, RP (corresponding author), Herbario Nacl Bolivia, Campus Univ,Calle 27, La Paz, Bolivia.",rlopez@userena.cl,"Armas, Cristina/A-1128-2012; Lopez, Ramiro Pablo/O-3491-2019","Armas, Cristina/0000-0003-0356-8075; Squeo, Francisco/0000-0003-3559-0250",Instituto de Ecologia y Biodiversidad (IEB); CONICYT (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia)/Beca Doctorado [2013/Folio 63130048]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1110228],"The Instituto de Ecologia y Biodiversidad (IEB), CONICYT (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia)/Beca Doctorado 2013/Folio 63130048 and FONDECYT 1110228 funded the study.

Whilst our current understanding of the dynamics of these symbionts is typically cast within a framework of vertical transmission only, horizontal transmission has been observed in a number of cases. For instance, several symbionts can transmit horizontally when their parasitoid hosts share oviposition patches with uninfected conspecifics, a phenomenon called superparasitism. Despite this, horizontal transmission, and the host contact structures that facilitates it, have not been considered in heritable symbiont epidemiology. Here, we tested for the importance of host contact, and resulting horizontal transmission, for the epidemiology of a male-killing heritable symbiont (Arsenophonus nasoniae) in parasitoid wasp hosts. We observed that host contact through superparasitism is necessary for this symbiont's spread in populations of its primary host Nasonia vitripennis, such that when superparasitism rates are high, A. nasoniae almost reaches fixation, causes highly female biased population sex ratios and consequently causes local host extinction. We further tested if natural interspecific variation in superparasitism behaviours predicted symbiont dynamics among parasitoid species. We found that A. nasoniae was maintained in laboratory populations of a closely related set of Nasonia species, but declined in other, more distantly related pteromalid hosts. The natural proclivity of a species to superparasitise was the primary factor determining symbiont persistence. Our results thus indicate that host contact behaviour is a key factor for heritable microbe dynamics when horizontal transmission is possible, and that 'reproductive parasite' phenotypes, such as male-killing, may be of secondary importance in the dynamics of such symbiont infections.","[Parratt, Steven R.; Frost, Crystal L.; Schenkel, Martijn A.; Rice, Annabel; Hurst, Gregory D.

Ongoing camera trap surveys suggest that large wild ungulates are exceptionally rare in the region. On the contrary, livestock is abundant. Accordingly, scats analysis revealed that livestock constituted most of the biomass intake for wolves, although small mammals were the most frequent prey items. Wild ungulates were occasional prey, and although wolves make use of the main village garbage dump as a food source, garbage remains were scarce in scat samples. Wolf dependence on anthropogenic resources, primarily livestock, generates human-wildlife conflicts in the study area. Uncontrolled carcass disposal seems to boost this wolf behaviour. Synanthropy enhances the probability of wolf-human encounters and thus increases the risk of direct persecution, vehicle collisions, and hybridisation with dogs. When livestock is not available, small mammals are an important alternative prey for wolves. This may increase interspecific competition, particularly with lynx, which is also lacking natural prey in the area. Our preliminary results contribute to wolf ecology and conservation in the Anatolian-Caucasian range, where further studies are urgently needed to generate baseline data.","[Capitani, Claudia] Univ York, Dept Environm, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Chynoweth, Mark; Sekercioglu, Cagan H.] Univ Utah, Dept Biol, 257 South 1400 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Kusak, Josip] Univ Zagreb, Dept Biol, Heinzelova 55, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Coban, Emrah; Sekercioglu, Cagan H.] KuzeyDoga Soc, Ortakapi Mah Sehit Yusuf Cad 93 Kat 1, TR-36100 Merkez, Kars, Turkey; [Sekercioglu, Cagan H.] Koc Univ Rumelifeneri, Coll Sci, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey","Capitani, C (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Environm, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",claudia.capitani@york.ac.uk,"Sekercioglu, Cagan H/A-2331-2013; Kusak, Josip/T-8344-2019","Sekercioglu, Cagan H/0000-0001-9639-294X; Capitani, Claudia/0000-0002-1899-8679; Kusak, Josip/0000-0002-5544-6486; Sekercioglu, Cagan H./0000-0003-3193-0377",Christensen Fund; National Geographic Society Education FoundationNational Geographic Society; UNDP Small Grants Programme; University of Utah; Whitley Fund,"We thank the General Directorate of Nature Conservation and National Parks and Forestry General Directorate of Turkey's Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs for permitting our research, which was conducted under the Eastern Turkey Wildlife Research and Conservation protocol signed with the ministry.

Here we report for the first time on a large population of the endangered coral species Euphyllia paradivisa from the MCEs of the Gulf of Eilat/Aqaba (GOE/A), Red Sea. The mesophotic zone in some parts of the study site harbors a specialized coral community predominantly comprising E. paradivisa (73 % of the total coral cover), distributed from 36 to 72 m depth. Here we sought to elucidate the strict distribution but high abundance of E. paradivisa in the MCEs at the GOE/A. We present 4 yr of observations and experiments that provide insight into the physiological plasticity of E. paradivisa: its low mortality rates at high light intensities, high competitive abilities, successful symbiont adaptation to the shallow-water environment, and tolerance to bleaching conditions or survival during prolonged bleaching. Despite its ability to survive under high irradiance in shallow water, E. paradivisa is not found in the shallow reef of the GOE/A. We suggest several factors that may explain the high abundance and exclusivity of E. paradivisa in the MCE: its heterotrophic capabilities; its high competition abilities; the possibility of it finding a deep-reef refuge there from fish predation; and its concomitant adaptation to this environment.","[Eyal, Gal; Eyal-Shaham, Lee; Ben-Zvi, Or; Loya, Yossi] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Eyal, Gal; Eyal-Shaham, Lee; Cohen, Itay; Tamir, Raz] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci Eilat, Elat, Israel; [Cohen, Itay] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Earth Sci, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Tamir, Raz] Bar Ilan Univ, Fac Life Sci, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Sinniger, Frederic] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, R&D Ctr Submarine Resources, 2-15 Natsushimacho, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 2370061, Japan; [Sinniger, Frederic] Univ Ryukyus, Trop Biosphere Res Ctr, Nishihara, Okinawa 90301, Japan","Eyal, G (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.; Eyal, G (corresponding author), Interuniv Inst Marine Sci Eilat, Elat, Israel.",galeyal@mail.tau.ac.il,"Loya, Yossi/N-3060-2019; Loya, Yossi/J-3039-2012; Loya, Joseph/AAJ-9014-2020; Eyal, Gal/P-7884-2019","Loya, Yossi/0000-0001-6870-9444; Eyal, Gal/0000-0002-3028-8653; Sinniger, Frederic/0000-0002-4175-5931",Israel Taxonomy Initiative (ITI); Sciences Based Management (SBM); Israel Science Foundation (ISF)Israel Science Foundation [341/12]; USAID/MERC GrantUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) [M32-037],"We would like to thank the Interuniversity Institute for Marine Sciences for making their facilities available to us.

Although it is assumed to be costly to be exploited, mechanisms to control exploitation are surprisingly rare, making the persistence of cooperation a fundamental paradox in evolutionary biology and ecology. Focusing on between-species cooperation (mutualism), we hypothesize that the temporal sequence in which exploitation occurs relative to cooperation affects its net costs and argue that this can help explain when and where control mechanisms are observed in nature. Our principal prediction is that when exploitation occurs late relative to cooperation, there should be little selection to limit its effects (analogous to tolerated theft in human cooperative groups). Although we focus on cases in which mutualists and exploiters are different individuals (of the same or different species), our inferences can readily be extended to cases in which individuals exhibit mixed cooperative-exploitative strategies. We demonstrate that temporal structure should be considered alongside spatial structure as an important process affecting the evolution of cooperation. We also provide testable predictions to guide future empirical research on interspecific as well as intraspecific cooperation.","[Barker, Jessica L.; Bronstein, Judith L.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Barker, JL (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",jlbarker@email.arizona.edu,,"Barker, Jessica/0000-0002-8369-4823",National Institutes of Health grantUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [5K12GM000708-13]; National Science Foundation grantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1354155]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [K12GM000708] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"J.

Using camera-traps, we studied the species richness, activity patterns, and habitat use of middle and large mammals in two adjacent forests, a native forest and a Eucalyptus grandis reforestation located at the Colombian Central Andes. Since the two forests were adjacent, we expected no differences between species richness in the two forests. The reforestation was a monoculture and an artificial ecosystem, thus we expected differences in activity and habitat use by mammals in the two forest types. We did not find significant differences in the species richness between the forests. The activity of Sciurus granatensis and Mazama rufina was influenced by the time of the day, and there was a temporal and spatial segregation among the soil forager species Nasua nasua, Nasuella olivacea and Dasypus novemcinctus. The species N. nasua and D. novemcinctus used the Andean forest more than the reforestation, whereas N. olivacea used the reforestation more. D. novemcinctus and N. olivacea were mainly nocturnal and/or crepuscular, whereas N. nasua was mainly active during daytime. This suggests that the creation of a new habitat, such as the reforestation, might influence the interactions among some species and apparently, could reduce interspecific competition and thus contribute to their co-existence at the study zone though niche differentiation in time and space.","[Ramirez-Mejia, Andres F.] Univ Caldas, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Programa Biol, Calle 65 26-10, Manizales Caldas, Colombia; [Sanchez, Francisco] Univ Llanos, Fac Ciencias Basicas & Ingn, Programa Biol, Km 12 Via Puerto Lopez, Villavicencio, Colombia","Ramirez-Mejia, AF (corresponding author), Univ Caldas, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Programa Biol, Calle 65 26-10, Manizales Caldas, Colombia.",andresfeliper.mejia@gmail.com,,"Ramirez-Mejia, Andres F./0000-0002-1986-2458",CHEC; Fundacion Ecologica Cafetera,"We are grateful to Lucas Wauters, Dinesh Rao and two anonymous reviewers for their comments to improve the paper.

We examined interspecific and intraspecific differences in shoot biomass and defoliation tolerance for two semiarid, perennial cool-season bunchgrasses native to the Intermountain West, USA, Pseudoroegneria spicata and Elymus wawawaiensis, on the basis of four functional traits (specific leaf area [SLA], plant basal area, tiller number, and tiller mass). We applied two treatments, control and boot-defoliation, where the latter included defoliation at the early-reproductive (boot) stage, the phenological stage most vulnerable to herbivory, while the control treatment did not. We tested two contrasting hypotheses (i.e., that boot-defoliation tolerance is increased through either increases in SLA or through more favorable tiller demography). For shoot biomass, both grasses were less productive under the boot-defoliation treatment than for the control, but E. wawawaiensis displayed higher boot-defoliation tolerance than P. spicata. Interpopulation variation occurred in all four functional traits for P. spicata, but there were no such variation for E. wawawaiensis. The tiller demography hypothesis better explained boot-defoliation tolerance in both species, and neither SLA nor plant basal area was correlated with shoot biomass for either treatment. Of the traits measured, high tiller number served as the primary mechanism for shoot biomass and boot-defoliation tolerance in P. spicata, while tiller number and tiller mass were both important predictors of both shoot biomass and boot-defoliation tolerance.

For example, birds time migration in response, in part, to local and broadscale climate fluctuations to initiate breeding upon arrival to nesting territories, and prolonged inclement weather early in the breeding season can inhibit egg-laying and reduce productivity. Also, density-dependent regulation occurs in raptor populations, as territory size is related to resource availability. Arctic Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus tundrius; hereafter Arctic peregrine) have a limited and northern breeding distribution, including the Colville River Special Area (CRSA) in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, USA. We quantified influences of climate, topography, nest productivity, prey habitat, density dependence, and interspecific competition affecting Arctic peregrines in the CRSA by applying the DailMadsen model to estimate abundance and vital rates of adults on nesting cliffs from 1981 through 2002. Arctic peregrine abundance increased throughout the 1980s, which spanned the population's recovery from DDT-induced reproductive failure, until exhibiting a stationary trend in the 1990s. Apparent survival rate (i.e., emigration; death) was negatively correlated with the number of adult Arctic peregrines on the cliff the previous year, suggesting effects of density-dependent population regulation. Apparent survival and arrival rates (i.e., immigration; recruitment) were higher during years with earlier snowmelt and milder winters, and apparent survival was positively correlated with nesting season maximum daily temperature. Arrival rate was positively correlated with average Arctic peregrine productivity along a cliff segment from the previous year and initial abundance was positively correlated with cliff height. Higher cliffs with documented higher productivity (presumably indicative of higher-quality habitat), are a priority for continued protection from potential nearby development and disturbance to minimize population-level impacts. Climate change may affect Arctic peregrines in multiple ways, including through access to more snow-free nest sites and a lengthened breeding season that may increase likelihood of nest success.

The commonly observed pattern of links between specialists and generalists in these networks has been predicted to promote species coexistence. Plants also build highly species-rich mutualistic networks below ground with rootassociated fungi, and the structure of these plant-fungus networksmay also affect terrestrial community processes. By compiling high-throughput DNA sequencing data sets of the symbiosis of plants and their root-associated fungi fromthree localities along a latitudinal gradient, we uncovered the entire network architecture of these interactions under contrasting environmental conditions. Each network included more than 30 plant species and hundreds of mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi belonging to diverse phylogenetic groups. The results were consistent with the notion that processes shaping host-plant specialization of fungal species generate a unique linkage pattern that strongly contrasts with the pattern of above-ground plant-partner networks. Specifically, plant-fungus networks lacked a nested architecture, which has been considered to promote species coexistence in plant-partner networks. Rather, the below-ground networks had a conspicuous antinested topology. Our findings lead to the working hypothesis that terrestrial plant community dynamics are likely determined by the balance between above ground and below-ground webs of interspecific interactions.","[Toju, Hirokazu] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Guimaraes, Paulo R., Jr.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Ecol, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Olesen, Jens M.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Thompson, John N.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA","Toju, H (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",toju.hirokazu.4c@kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Toju, Hirokazu/T-7355-2019; Guimaraes, Paulo R./E-1915-2016; Guimaraes-Junior, Paulo R/M-1298-2016; Olesen, Jens M/A-3011-2009; Toju, Hirokazu/S-7307-2017","Guimaraes, Paulo R./0000-0001-9161-8305; Olesen, Jens M/0000-0003-1998-1083; Toju, Hirokazu/0000-0002-3362-3285; Olesen, Jes/0000-0002-6712-2702","Hakubi Center for Advanced Research, Kyoto University; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [26711026]; Funding Program for Next-Generation World-Leading Researchers of Cabinet Office, Government of Japan [GS014]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao PauloFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2009/54422-8]; Danish Science Research CouncilDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF) [1323-00278]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1048333]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26711026] Funding Source: KAKEN","This work was financially supported by the Hakubi Center for Advanced Research, Kyoto University, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI; grant 26711026), and the Funding Program for Next-Generation World-Leading Researchers of Cabinet Office, Government of Japan (grant GS014) to H.

We assessed the impact of eucalyptus plantations on niche partitioning in a carnivore community consisting of red fox (Vulpes vulpes), badger (Meles meles), and stone marten (Martes foina). Based on data from camera trapping, we evaluated the influence of eucalyptus plantations on species occupancy and detection in single-species and co-occurrence models and on temporal activity. Eucalyptus cover negatively influenced detection probability across all species in both single and co-occurrence models. Stone marten detection decreased with the presence of the other carnivores but red fox detection increased in the presence of badgers. Eucalyptus plantations had a negative effect on occupancy of red foxes, which preferred open farmland and evergreen oak forest. Stone marten preferred large patches of oak forest, whereas badger occupancy was positively influenced by patch richness. Occupancy of any one species was not influenced by the presence of any other species. Despite having an effect on the detection and occupancy of all 3 carnivores, eucalyptus plantations had no effect on the interactions within this carnivore community. However, these results have to be interpreted with precaution since the probability of detection for badger and stone marten, in 2011, was below 0.15, making it difficult to make accurate assumptions. The results show the relatively greater importance of habitat preferences compared with interspecific relationships in determining distribution of these carnivores and highlight the importance of using models that can correct for differences in detectability for inferring interspecific competition, especially when species occur at low densities.","[Cruz, Joana; White, Piran C.

In temperate regions, where daily and seasonal fluctuations are prominent, such decreases in daily temperature fluctuations can have a pronounced effect on the fitness of species and on the outcome of species interactions. In this study, the effect of a temperature regime with daily fluctuations versus a constant temperature on the fitness and interspecific interactions of three cryptic species of the marine nematode species complex of Litoditis marina (Pm I, Pm III and Pm IV) were investigated. In a lab experiment, different combinations of species (monospecific treatment: Pm I and Pm IV and Pm III alone; two-species treatment: Pm I + Pm IV; three-species treatment: Pm I + Pm IV + Pm III) were subjected to two different temperature regimes: one constant and one fluctuating temperature. Our results showed that fluctuating temperature had minor or no effects on the population fitness of the three species in monocultures. In contrast, interspecific interactions clearly influenced the fitness of all three species, both positively and negatively. Temperature regime did have a substantial effect on the interactions between the species. In the two-species treatment, temperature regime altered the interaction from a sort of mutualism to commensalism. In addition, the strength of the interspecific interactions changed depending on the temperature regime in the three-species treatment. This experiment confirms that interactions between the species can change depending on the abiotic environment; these results show that it is important to incorporate the effect of fluctuations on interspecific interactions to predict the effect of climate change on biodiversity.","[De Meester, Nele; Rigaux, Annelien; Derycke, Sofie; Moens, Tom] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Unit, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [De Meester, Nele; Rigaux, Annelien; Derycke, Sofie] Univ Ghent, Ctr Mol Phylogeny & Evolut, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Dos Santos, Giovanni A.

However, resource acquisition often involves conflicting functional demands that may ultimately shape broader ecological patterns. For instance, termites play major roles in ecosystem functioning through their foraging and building activities. Yet, while experiments suggest improved foraging in sand, nest construction depends on clay. Hence, these functions may trade off, with species optima reflecting interspecific variation in building requirements. We investigated whether a foraging-building trade-off could affect termite populations by using three species differing in building requirements, namely Neocapritermes braziliensis, Anoplotermes banksi and Labiotermes labralis. We characterized their populations in relation to soil texture and food amount across a tropical rain forest landscape, and then compared the observed patterns. Colony density was unrelated to food amount in the three species. However, A. banksi was denser at balanced mixtures of sand and clay, consistent with a compromise between foraging and building demands. Further, the species building more mineralized nests (L. labralis) was more abundant on clayish soils, whereas the species relying less on soil for nest construction (N. braziliensis) was more abundant on sandy soils. Changes in colony density correlated with changes in size structure: in N. braziliensis and A. banksi, colony mass variability increased with density due to a sharp decrease in minimum colony mass, consistent with higher productivity and/or size-asymmetric competition. This study suggests a novel functional trade-off that may help drive population density and size structure both within and across termite species.","[Costa Lima Pequeno, Pedro Aurelio] Natl Inst Amazonia Res, Grad Program Ecol, BR-69067375 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Franklin, Elizabeth] Natl Inst Amazonia Res, Biodivers Coordinat, BR-69067375 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Venticinque, Eduardo Martins] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Bot Ecol & Zool, BR-59072970 Natal, RN, Brazil; [Serrao Acioli, Agno Nonato] Univ Fed Amazonas, Inst Nat & Culture, BR-69630000 Benjamin Constant, AM, Brazil","Pequeno, PACL (corresponding author), Natl Inst Amazonia Res, Grad Program Ecol, Av Andre Araujo 2936, BR-69067375 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.",pacolipe@gmail.com,"Venticinque, Eduardo M/G-8961-2015","Venticinque, Eduardo M/0000-0002-3455-9107; Pequeno, Pedro/0000-0001-7350-0485","Brazilian state of Amazonas' Foundation for Research Support (FAPEAM); Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [470375/2006-0, 558318/2009-6]","We thank the staff of Fazenda UFAM, Jonatha P. da Silva, Rosinaldo C.

Neutral theory has made considerable progress in explaining static properties of communities, like species abundance distributions (SADs), with a simple and generic model, but was criticised for making unrealistic predictions of fundamental dynamic patterns and for being sensitive to interspecific differences in fitness. Here, we show that a generalised neutral theory incorporating environmental stochasticity may resolve these limitations. We apply the theory to real data (the tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island) and demonstrate that it much better explains the properties of short-term population fluctuations and the decay of compositional similarity with time, while retaining the ability to explain SADs. Furthermore, the predictions are considerably more robust to interspecific fitness differences. Our results suggest that this integration of niches and stochasticity may serve as a minimalistic framework explaining fundamental static and dynamic characteristics of ecological communities.","[Kalyuzhny, Michael K; Kadmon, Ronen] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Life Sci, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Shnerb, Nadav M.] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Phys, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel","Kalyuzhny, M (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Life Sci, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",michael.kalyuzhny@mail.huji.ac.il,,,,,,49,52,54,1,92,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

We use four case studies (Drosophila flies, Siphopteron slugs, Cimex bugs, and Callosobruchus beetles) to show that CW entails physiological and life-history costs, but can evolve into a routine mating strategy that, in some species, involves insemination through the wound. Although interspecific variation in CW is documented, few data exist on intraspecific and none on individual differences. Although defensive mechanisms evolve in the wound recipient, our review also indicates that mating costs in species with CW are slightly higher than in other species. Whether such costs are dose-or frequency-dependent, and whether defense occurs as resistance or tolerance, decisively affects the evolutionary outcome. In addition to sexual conflict, CW may also become a model system for reproductive isolation. In this context, we put forward a number of predictions, including (1) occasional CW is more costly than routine CW, (2) CW is more costly in between-than within-population matings, and (3) in the presence of CW, selection may favor the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases if they induce resource allocation. Finally, we outline, and briefly discuss, several medical implications of CW in humans.","[Reinhardt, Klaus; Anthes, Nils; Lange, Rolanda] Univ Tubingen, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Anim Evolutionary Ecol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Lange, Rolanda] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Reinhardt, K (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Anim Evolutionary Ecol, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.",k.reinhardt@uni-tuebingen.de,"Anthes, Nils/A-2434-2009","Anthes, Nils/0000-0003-4189-7849",,,,155,28,28,3,49,"COLD SPRING HARBOR LAB PRESS, PUBLICATIONS DEPT",COLD SPRING HARBOR,"1 BUNGTOWN RD, COLD SPRING HARBOR, NY 11724 USA",1943-0264,,,CSH PERSPECT BIOL,Cold Spring Harbor Perspect.

Thus, understanding fungal community dynamics within dead wood is crucial to understanding decomposition and carbon cycling. Mycelia compete for wood territory, by employing antagonistic mechanisms involving changes in morphology, and production of volatile and diffusible chemicals. This is metabolically costly, and may affect the rate of use of the resource. The metabolic rate during pairwise interactions between wood decay ascomycetes and basidiomycetes was determined by measuring CO2 production. CO2 evolution altered over time, but changes were combination-specific. In only two combinations when the dominant competitor overgrew the opponent's territory as mycelia cords did CO2 evolution increase over the course of the whole interaction. In most interactions, CO2 evolution increased only after complete replacement of one competitor, suggesting utilisation of the predecessor mycelium or differences in decay ability due to alteration of the resource by the predecessor. There was no relationship between rate of CO2 evolution and combative ability nor outcome of interaction. (C) 2014 The Authors.

In 2011/2012, we investigated the feeding ecology of two large-sized waterbirds, the great egret, Ardea alba, and the roseate spoonbill, Platalea ajaja, which breed sympatrically in limnetic and estuarine colonies 65 km apart in southern Brazil. Whole blood from chicks was sampled for delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes, and their diets were assessed using direct (conventional) methods. The diet of spoonbills consisted of fish, insects, crustaceans, mollusks, and seeds, whereas great egrets fed mainly on fish, insects, and crustaceans. Bayesian stable isotope mixing models indicated that spoonbills fed exclusively in limnetic habitats, regardless of where they bred, whereas egrets breeding in the estuarine colony fed on both estuarine and limnetic prey, expanding their isotopic niche considerably. Dietary data confirmed this result, with the diets of egrets in the freshwater colony showing high similarity to the diets of spoonbills in both freshwater and estuarine colonies. The isotopic niche overlap was the lowest between species in the estuarine colony, suggesting that the feeding plasticity of egrets reduces interspecific competition during breeding.","[Britto, Vanessa Oliveira; Bugoni, Leandro] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Inst Biol Sci, Waterbirds & Sea Turtles Lab, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; [Britto, Vanessa Oliveira; Bugoni, Leandro] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Inst Biol Sci, Grad Program Biol Freshwater Ecosyst, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil","Britto, VO (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Inst Biol Sci, Waterbirds & Sea Turtles Lab, CP 474, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.",vanessa.obritto@gmail.com,"Bugoni, Leandro/F-9539-2012","Bugoni, Leandro/0000-0003-0689-7026; oliveira britto, vanessa/0000-0003-4919-4558",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [308697/2012-0],"The authors would like to thank the following colleagues for support with lab and fieldwork: Fernanda Marques, Paloma Carvalho, Patricia Mancini, Luciano Fischer, Augusto Silva-Costa, Leonardo Furlanetto, Cindy Barreto, Fernando Faria, Giovanni Mauricio, Rayanne Brum, Guilherme Nunes, Dimas Gianuca, Cicero Faria, Suzana Martins, Adriano Miranda and Felipe Neves.

We describe the diet and patterns of use of food resources of four migratory shorebirds at Samborombon Bay, Argentina, one of the most important sites for shorebirds in the western hemisphere. The birds consumed items representing at least 15 taxa but only a few taxa comprised the main resources consumed. The four species of shorebird showed dietary flexibility influenced by season and tidal level. Co-occurring species showed complementary differentiation in two dimensions of their respective trophic niches (taxonomic composition, size-class). The greatest differences in taxonomic composition of the diet were between Red Knots, which fed mainly on molluscs, and the other three species, which fed mainly on polychaetes. Polychaete consumers that co-occurred during autumn (Hudsonian Godwit and White-rumped Sandpiper) focussed on different prey sizes. Alternatively, shorebirds that co-occurred during winter (Hudsonian Godwits and Two-banded Plovers) fed mainly on polychaete of similar size but showed differences in the taxonomic composition of their diets. Interspecific competition for food resources might shape the composition of the shorebird assemblage of our study area during the austral autumn and winter.","[Martinez-Curci, Natalia S.; Isacch, Juan P.] Univ Nacl Mar Plata UNMdP, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Lab Vertebrados, Inst Invest Marinas Costeras IIMyC, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Azpiroz, Adrian B.] Inst Invest Biol Clemente Estable, Dept Biodiversidad & Genet, Montevideo 11600, Uruguay; [Elias, Rodolfo] Univ Nacl Mar Plata UNMdP, Inst Invest Marinas Costeras IIMyC, Lab Bioindicadores Bentonicos, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Martinez-Curci, NS (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Mar Plata UNMdP, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Lab Vertebrados, Inst Invest Marinas Costeras IIMyC, Funes 3250,Mar Del Plata B7602AYJ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",nanusmc@gmail.com,"Martinez-Curci, Natalia/AAE-5093-2019",,Rufford Foundation; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata (UNMdP)National University of La Plata,"We thank L.

Once introduced into its new environment, feral populations may arise and pose threats to local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In France, it is in fact considered as a risk for the Mediterranean pond turtle, Mauremys leprosa, and the European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis, as they may compete for resources and habitat. Freshwater turtles are also host to a variety of parasites including protozoans and helminths. When introduced turtles escape, parasites may spread to native species. The objective of this study was to document the extent of platyhelminth invasions from T. s. elegans to natural M. leprosa populations in northern Spain and southern France and to evaluate the risks that parasite host-switching may pose on indigenous freshwater turtle species. From DNA barcoding analysis based on the sequencing of the Cytochrome c Oxidase I gene, the Bayesian tree and p-distance comparisons of closely related haplotypes revealed a greater polystome richness within M. leprosa than expected, suggesting that host switching may take place in natural environments. Because these parasites most typically infest American turtles like Chrysemys picta marginata and Graptemys pseudogeographica in their natural home range and because parasites were also found within T. s. elegans feral populations, it is suggested that the red-eared slider would serve as a carrier for a variety of not strictly host-specific polystomes that are transmitted to M. leprosa throughout the south of France. The global trade in freshwater turtles thus provides opportunity for parasites to be transported to new destinations which could impact the physiology, behavior and survival of native turtle species.","[Meyer, Leon; Du Preez, Louis; Verneau, Olivier] North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci & Management, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Meyer, Leon; Bonneau, Elodie; Heritier, Laurent; Palacios, Carmen; Verneau, Olivier] Univ Perpignan, Ctr Format & Rech Environm Mediterraneens, UMR 5110, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Meyer, Leon; Bonneau, Elodie; Heritier, Laurent; Palacios, Carmen; Verneau, Olivier] CNRS, Ctr Format & Rech Environm Mediterraneens, UMR5110, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Quintana, Marc Franch] Univ Barcelona, Dept Biol Anim, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Valdeon, Aitor] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Geog & Reg Planning, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain; [Valdeon, Aitor] Aranzadi Soc Sci, Dept Herpetol, Donostia San Sebastian 20014, Gipuzkoa, Spain; [Sadaoui, Amel; Kechemir-Issad, Nadia] Univ Sci & Technol Houari Boumedienne, Fac Biol Sci, Lab Biodiversite & Environm Interact Genomes, El Alia 16111, Bab Ezzouar, Algeria","Verneau, O (corresponding author), North West Univ, Unit Environm Sci & Management, ZA-2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa.",leonmeyer8@gmail.com; Louis.DuPreez@nwu.ac.za; bonneau.elodie@gmail.com; laurent.heritier@univ-perp.fr; apoarmatu@gmail.com; emys@galapagosdenavarra.com; sadaoui-amel@outlook.fr; ndkechemir@gmail.com; carmen.palacios@univ-perp.fr; verneau@univ-perp.fr,"Valdeon, Aitor/K-6091-2013; Quintana, Marc Franch/J-1104-2014","Valdeon, Aitor/0000-0002-5002-5287; Quintana, Marc Franch/0000-0001-9503-1608",CNRSCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)European Commission,"Funding for this research was provided by grants from the CNRS and NRF (PICS no 4837) and from the MAE and NRF (ProteaEgide no 25878VB) to OV and LDP.

The more abundant are supposed to be involved in crop pest regulation. However, the lack of knowledge about ecological interactions between ants and their habitat, including other ant species of the community, leaded to contradictory views on their efficiency as potential biological control agents. In the present study, we studied the impact of shade trees on the occurrence and spatial distribution of the most abundant ants of cocoa agroforestry systems of Southern Cameroon. We characterized shade of four traditional cocoa farms and described distribution patterns of numerically dominant ants through spatial analysis. Our results showed that the populations of the most abundant arboreal species, in our study Oecophylla longinoda, Tetramorium aculeatum, Crematogaster spp., Camponotus spp. were generally aggregated in plantations. However, the distribution structure of ant populations was variable between samples, suggesting that the normal development of ant colonies may interfere with ecological constraints like interspecific competition and abiotic factors. Distribution mapping as well as statistical analysis showed that highest densities of O. longinoda were sheltered by cocoa trees in the sunniest areas of plots. On the other hand, Crematogaster species were usually strongly aggregated in the most shaded areas. Mechanisms involved in ant/shade relationships were discussed and we suggested that a good management of shade may take into account ant communities, which could play a significant role in conservation biological control against cocoa pests.","[Tadu, Zephirin; Djieto-Lordon, Champlain; Yede; Youbi, Edith Messop; Alene, Chantal Desiree] Univ Yaounde I, Zool Lab, Fac Sci, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Fomena, Abraham] Univ Yaounde I, Lab Parasitol & Ecol, Fac Sci, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Babin, Regis] CIRAD, UPR Bioagresseurs Analyse & Maitrise Risque, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Babin, Regis] ICIPE, Plant Hlth Div, Coffee Pest Project, Nairobi 00100, Kenya","Babin, R (corresponding author), CIRAD, UPR Bioagresseurs Analyse & Maitrise Risque, F-34398 Montpellier, France.",regis.babin@cirad.fr,"Babin, Regis/N-3682-2019; Babin, Regis/D-5322-2014","Babin, Regis/0000-0002-3753-1193",French Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the REPARAC project,"We thank farmers of Bokito, Obala and Ngomedzap for allowing us to carry out the present study in their cocoa farms.

Studies exploring the Stress gradient hypothesis (SGH) - which predicts that the patterns of interspecific interactions shift from negative to positive with increasing environmental severity - conceptualize environmental severity predominantly from a spatial perspective. Here, from a temporal perspective and for intraspecific interactions, we asked: do the predictions of the SGH at the intraspecific level apply to seasonal change in environmental severity? We conducted a field experiment, which was complemented by a two-year field survey of natural populations of the non-native biennial forb Alliaria petiolata at the Koffler Scientific Reserve, Ontario, Canada. In both experiment and field survey studies we found statistically significant negative density-dependent survival in the productive summer period and positive density-dependent survival over the severe winter period. Effects were stronger in the field experiment than in the survey of natural populations. We suggest that the SGH at the intraspecific level may be applicable to seasonal variation in environmental severity, though our ability to detect its effect in natural communities may depend on other factors such as species dominance and environmental heterogeneity.","[Biswas, Shekhar R.; Wagner, Helene H.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada","Biswas, SR (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 3359 Mississauga Rd North, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada.",shekhar.biswas@utoronto.ca,"Wagner, Helene/E-6090-2011","Wagner, Helene/0000-0001-6261-5922; Biswas, Shekhar/0000-0001-9203-2488",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"The study was supported by a NSERC discovery grant to HHW.

Blume (evergreen, shade intolerant) and Nothofagus alpina (P. et E.) Oerst. (deciduous, mid-tolerant to shade) seedlings established in scarified gaps in a Nothofagus old-growth forest in the Chilean Andes that was subjected to a shelterwood cut. Soils were scarified with heavy machinery that removed up to 40 cm of the upper horizons (e.g. it completely removed the litter layer and organic horizon, and in some cases partially the A horizon) to eliminate bamboo (Chusquea culeou E. Desv) shoots and rhizomes from the scarified areas. Two years after planting, seedlings were growing free of understory competition and mortality patterns were assessed using logistic regression models with the following predictor variables: (1) basal diameter growth in the prior year, and (2) soil strength measured as resistance to penetration. The probability of mortality of both species was highly predictable based on recent basal diameter growth. N. dombeyi seedlings appeared to be less affected by mortality, as reflected in lower sensitivity of mortality at lower growth rates compared to N. alpina. High values of resistance to penetration (> 2,000 kPa) induced a higher probability of mortality in N. alpina (up to 40 % at 3,500 kPa). In contrast, N. dombeyi mortality was not significantly influenced by soil strength, which illustrates the more stress-resistant and pioneer character of this species. This study showed that recent growth rates can be used as a predictor of future mortality, but these relationships need to be calibrated for each species. In addition, our results suggest that species characteristics that relate to resource limitations, such as shade tolerance, are not adequate to understand effects of other stressors, such as soil disturbance, on mortality patterns.","[Soto, Daniel P.; Puettmann, Klaus J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Donoso, Pablo J.] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias Forestales & Recursos Nat, Valdivia, Chile","Soto, DP (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",dsoto79@gmail.com,"Soto, Daniel/AAG-9627-2020","Soto, Daniel/0000-0002-7119-8558; Donoso, Pablo/0000-0003-0339-4845",graduate School of the Faculty of Forest Sciences and Natural Resources at the Universidad Austral de Chile; Becas Chile scholarship for doctoral studies at Oregon State University;  [FONDEF-CONICYT D07I1034],"The study was supported by grant FONDEF-CONICYT D07I1034.

The establishment of non-native willows and poplars has unknown effects for Salix humboldtiana, the only native floodplain tree species in this region. To clarify establishment processes and to assess whether interspecific competition among the Salicaceae taxa may occur and therefore whether the native species can coexist in the long term, we analysed age structure and growth performances of the dominant four taxa within mixed adult forest stands along the Rio Negro, Argentina. Low mean ages of < 15 years for all four taxa within 20 stands could be detected and suggest frequent and severe disturbances resulting in the removal of existing vegetation and subsequent creation of sites for establishment. Trees of the same stand showed the same age structure indicating joint establishment events with all taxa involved. A significant better growth performance (basal area, crown diameter) could be proved for the invasive willows. Considering the upper and middle river separately in a total of 88 studied plots, S. humboldtiana was more frequent at the middle river stretch, while invasive willows showed an opposing pattern suggesting a downstream directed invasion process. The results showed that competition pressure in mature mixed stands could affect S. humboldtiana. However, these stands are usually removed by river dynamics creating new sediment bars and islands.

We examined these effects on diel habitat use in a community of three sexually-dimorphic macropodid marsupial species: western grey kangaroo Macropus fuliginosus, red-necked wallaby M. rufogriseus and swamp wallaby Wallabia bicolor. In particular, our study seeks evidence of these effects operating concurrently at the intra-and interspecific levels. We used radio-tracking to quantify habitat use and characterised each used location by recording the cover of plant functional groups and the presence of plant species. During nocturnal foraging periods we predicted that smaller animals (between and within species) should use habitats with higher-quality forage, which is often less abundant, than larger animals, as metabolic demand scales with body size. During diurnal resting periods we predicted that smaller animals (between and within species), being more vulnerable to predation, should use greater concealment cover than larger animals. Western grey kangaroos and swamp wallabies behaved as predicted during foraging periods, but red-necked wallabies did not, using more open, poorer-quality habitats than expected. Only western grey kangaroos showed a within-species effect on habitat use: the relatively smaller females foraged in higher-quality patches. Habitats used by animals during the resting period generally offered greater concealment cover than those used during the foraging period, but there were no clear body size effects on the density of vegetation used. In our system, body size alone could not explain all of the observed patterns, suggesting that there may also be individual differences in habitat requirements influenced by factors such as reproductive costs, predation risk and social facilitation.","[Garnick, Sarah; Elgar, Mark A.; Coulson, Graeme] Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Di Stefano, Julian] Univ Melbourne, Dept Forest & Ecosyst Sci, Melbourne Sch Land & Environm, Creswick Campus, Vic 3363, Australia","Garnick, S (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Zool, Gate 13 Royal Parade, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",garnicks@unimelb.edu.au,"Di Stefano, Julian/M-9672-2019","Di Stefano, Julian/0000-0001-7846-6642; Garnick, Sarah/0000-0001-9049-2173; Elgar, Mark/0000-0003-0861-6064","Univ. of Melbourne's Faculty of Science, School of Land and Environment, and Optometry and Vision Sciences Animal Ethics Committee [0810628]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [0664120]; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment Fund [84176]; Australian Postgraduate Research Award","We thank Daryl Panther, Jemma Cripps and many volunteers for assistance with macropodid capture, Michelle Wilson for general assistance, David Lockwood for assistance in identifying plant species, and Parks Victoria (Halls Gap) and the Dept of Sustainability and Environment (Cavendish and Horsham) for logistical support and the use of Victoria Valley Airbase.

We test the hypothesis that mismatch between interacting male and female secondary sexual structures gives rise to increased harm to females, consistent with the outcome predicted from a history of sexual conflict. We mate Drosophila sechellia females to males from a collection of D. mauritiana-D. sechellia interspecific genetic introgression lines that possess quantitative morphological variation in the posterior lobe of the genital arch, an external genital structure that can cause wounds to the female abdomen during mating. We find that males with smaller posterior lobes, and those that possess lobes with similarities in shape to D. mauritiana, cause more severe wounding compared to either D. sechellia males with strain-specific morphologies or introgression males that possess larger lobes or lobes with more pronounced D. sechellia features. These results suggest a possible history of sexual conflict during the evolution of the posterior lobe in D. sechellia, but also suggest a potential contribution of divergence in sensory recognition mechanisms to posterior lobe evolution.","[Masly, John P.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Kamimura, Yoshitaka] Keio Univ, Dept Biol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2338521, Japan","Masly, JP (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",masly@ou.edu,,"Masly, John/0000-0003-3448-0914","University of Oklahoma; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [22770058]","We thank A.

Using established cranio-dental indicators to reveal dietary specialisations towards bone eating, flesh slicing, and non-flesh food crushing, inferences were made concerning the proportions of flesh to non-flesh foods in the diet, and hence the level of camivory adopted by each taxon. Significant temporal differences were found in the diet and frequency of tooth wear of C lupus from MIS 3, 5a and 7 in Britain. Relative body size comparisons based on lower carnassial length also revealed variation in body size for the Pleistocene age groups, correlating with differences in diet. Stepwise Discriminant Function Analyses revealed large-bodied MIS 5a C lupus to be hypercarnivorous and specialised in fast flesh slicing and to some extent bone consumption, whereas relatively smaller-bodied MIS 3 and 7 C. lupus were both less carnivorous and more specialised in crushing nonmeat foods. Modern wolves from central Sweden are smaller than those of MIS 5a and hypercarnivorous, although with greater specialisation towards crushing of non-meat foods. Temporal variations in diet were related to changes in prey diversity, competition from other carnivores, openness of the environment, and ultimately climate, and reflect the cranio-dental plasticity of C lupus. In contrast, no temporal differences in diet were found in age groups of C. mosbachensis and C etruscus, which may relate to more stable overall conditions in comparison to the later Pleistocene. The cranio-dental characteristics of the smaller-bodied mesocarnivore C etruscus indicate adaptations to non-meat food crushing, whereas in the similarly small C mosbachensis, enhanced flesh slicing capabilities and reduced crushing abilities indicate that it was more carnivorous than C etruscus. C. etruscus and C mosbachensis were both more specialised than C lupus. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Flower, Lucy O.

In order to provide an overview of and access point to this rich literature and to guide future research on juvenile fish growth dynamics, we review patterns of growth variation in YOY plaice following settlement and evaluate evidence for underlying causes, including maximum growth, temperature, prey conditions and competition. A decline in growth rate during late summer and autumn was the clearest and most widespread pattern, but was not clearly related to any of the potential causes previously considered. Interannual growth variation was substantial and despite evidence that intraspecific competition was responsible, other possible causes were also supported and others were only rarely assessed. Growth also varied considerably at a range of spatial scales (100s of m-100s of km). Causes of small-scale (<10 km) and regional (>200 km) growth variation remain poorly understood and while intermediate-scale growth variation has been related to prey conditions and intraspecific competition, the role of interspecific competition requires further investigation. Therefore, despite clear evidence for growth heterogeneity at numerous spatiotemporal scales, underlying causes remain elusive. We highlight some principal challenges to measuring and understanding the complex and scale-dependent causes of growth variation. To overcome these challenges, and therefore resolve important nursery processes for juvenile fish, we recommend more detailed and spatiotemporally explicit investigations of growth, metabolic processes and physiological energetics in situ: a focus on possible proximate and ultimate factors driving these dynamics: and development of new hypotheses to explain growth variation starting with general physical features that define nursery environments.

Intriguingly, phylogenetic analysis shows that the species constitutes one evolutionary lineage in a cluster of the otherwise commensal Streptococcus mitis strains, with which humans live in harmony. In a comparative analysis of 35 genomes, including phylogenetic analyses of all predicted genes, we have shown that the pathogenic pneumococcus has evolved into a master of genomic flexibility while lineages that evolved into the nonpathogenic S. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with their host by stabilizing an approximately 15%-reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. Our data further provide evidence that interspecies gene transfer between S. pneumoniae and S. mitis occurs in a unidirectional manner, i. e., from S. mitis to S. pneumoniae. Import of genes from S. mitis and other mitis, anginosus, and salivarius group streptococci ensured allelic replacements and antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of S. pneumoniae. Our study explains how the unique structural diversity of the pneumococcal capsule emerged and conceivably will continue to increase and reveals a striking example of the fragile border between the commensal and pathogenic lifestyles. While genomic plasticity enabling quick adaptation to environmental stress is a necessity for the pathogenic streptococci, the commensal lifestyle benefits from stability. IMPORTANCE One of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the commensal Streptococcus mitis are closely related obligate symbionts associated with hominids. Faced with a shortage of accessible hosts, the two opposing lifestyles evolved in parallel. We have shown that the nonpathogenic S. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with its host by stabilizing a reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. Meanwhile, the pathogenic pneumococcus evolved into a master of genomic flexibility and imports genes from S. mitis and other related streptococci. This process ensured antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of S. pneumoniae, which conceivably will continue to increase and present a challenge to disease prevention.","[Kilian, Mogens; Jensen, Anders; Brueggemann, Holger] Aarhus Univ, Fac Hlth, Dept Biomed, Aarhus, Denmark; [Riley, David R.; Tettelin, Herve] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Inst Genome Sci, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA","Kilian, M (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Fac Hlth, Dept Biomed, Aarhus, Denmark.",kilian@biomed.au.dk,"Jensen, Anders/B-1968-2016","Jensen, Anders/0000-0003-1185-3343; Bruggemann, Holger/0000-0001-7433-0190; Kilian, Mogens/0000-0002-5861-0472",Danish Research Council for Health and Disease [10-083748]; University of Maryland School of Medicine; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission,"This work was supported by grant 10-083748 from the Danish Research Council for Health and Disease and internal funds from the University of Maryland School of Medicine.

Identification and assessment of the risk posed by intruders is crucial to defending a territory, and fishes on coral reefs have been found to attend to body shape, body size, and coloration when responding to intruders. We examined the extent to which dusky damselfish (Stegastes adustus) discriminate among distinct categories of intruders by measuring the distance at which a fish attacks an intruder and the relative intensity and frequency of those attacks. We found that S. adustus discriminated among perceived threats, attacking conspecifics more intensely and more often than egg-predators and herbivores, and showing a trend of attacking those groups more often than invertebrate-feeders, which do not compete with damselfish for resources. Furthermore, territory holders attacked initial-phase wrasses from a farther distance than terminal-phase wrasses, suggesting that they can discriminate among classes of individuals within a species other than their own. Dusky damselfish thus exhibit the ability to make fine distinctions among intruders in a diverse ecosystem.","[Schacter, Carley R.; Albright, Lindsey B.; Dubofsky, Elizabeth A.; Fitzsimmons, Jessica N.; Focht, Rebecca; Nadler, Lauren E.; Sandercock, Maria; Taylor, Lauren; Walfoort, David; Whitten, Torrey; Williams, Lisa J.; Rosenthal, Gil G.] Boston Univ, Marine Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Schacter, CR (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada.",crs634@mun.ca,,,,,,38,3,3,0,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

The frequency of males with aspermy increased logarithmically with radiation level. While 18.4% of males from contaminated areas had no sperm that was only the case for 3.0% of males from uncontaminated control areas. Furthermore, there were negative relationships between sperm quality as reflected by reduced sperm velocity and motility, respectively, and radiation.

Mapping out potentially suitable habitats on a country-wide scale and identifying areas with potentially high levels of threats to large carnivore survival is necessary to develop national conservation action plans. We used a novel approach to map and identify these areas in Botswana for its large carnivore guild consisting of lion (Panthera leo), leopard (Panthera pardus), spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta), brown hyaena (Hyaena brunnea), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) and African wild dog (Lycaon pictus). The habitat suitability for large carnivores depends primarily on prey availability, interspecific competition, and conflict with humans. Prey availability is most likely the strongest natural determinant. We used the distribution of biomass of typical wild ungulate species occurring in Botswana which is preyed upon by the six large carnivores to evaluate the potential suitability of the different management zones in the country to sustain large carnivore populations. In areas where a high biomass of large prey species occurred, we assumed interspecific competition between dominant and subordinated competitors to be high. This reduced the suitability of these areas for conservation of subordinate competitors, and vice versa. We used the percentage of prey biomass of the total prey and livestock biomass to identify areas with potentially high levels of conflict in agricultural areas. High to medium biomass of large prey was mostly confined to conservation zones, while small prey biomass was more evenly spread across large parts of the country. This necessitates different conservation strategies for carnivores with a preference for large prey, and those that can persist in the agricultural areas.

Rugosity, number of crevices and benthic diversity positively predicted the distribution of O. trinitatis. Turf algae was the preferred food item at all sites, but given its high availability inside and outside territory boundaries, it did not seem to be a limiting factor on the density of this blenny, as opposed to substrate heterogeneity. Bite rate was higher in the afternoon and for smaller individuals (juveniles). Territory size showed local variation and, although larger territories may be an effect of density-dependent conditions (more available space in low-density areas), we propose that individuals expand territories to compensate for residing in areas of lower quality (i. e. of low structural complexity). Larger individuals defended larger territories and residents responded differently to intruders, with higher rates of agonistic interactions towards potential competitors. Higher agonistic rates were also observed in larger territories and at low-complexity sites.","[Medeiros, Paulo R.] Univ Fed Campina Grande, Unidade Acad Ciencias Exatas e Nat, BR-58900000 Cajazeiras, PB, Brazil; [Medeiros, Paulo R.; Rada, Danilo P.; Rosa, Ricardo S.] Univ Fed Paraiba, Ctr Ciencias Exatas & Nat, BR-58059900 Joao Pessoa, PB, Brazil","Medeiros, PR (corresponding author), Univ Fed Campina Grande, Unidade Acad Ciencias Exatas e Nat, BR-58900000 Cajazeiras, PB, Brazil.",medeirospr@gmail.com,"Rosa, Ricardo/AAH-4679-2019; Rosa, Ricardo S/C-8266-2014","Rosa, Ricardo S/0000-0002-4289-2241",The Brazilian Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ),"We are indebted to A.

Little is known regarding how interspecific variation produced through sexual selection affects other functional systems. Here, we examine how morphological diversity resulting from sexual selection impacts aerobic locomotor performance. Using Xiphophorus (swordtail fish) and their close relatives (N = 19 species), we examined whether the evolution of a longer sexually selected sword affects critical swimming speed. We also examined the effect of other suborganismal, physiological, and morphological traits on critical swimming speed, as well as their relationship with sword length. In correlation analyses, we found no significant relationship between sword length and critical swimming speed. Unexpectedly, we found that critical swimming speed was higher in species with longer swords, after controlling for body size in multiple regression analyses. We also found several suborganismal and morphological predictors of critical swimming speed, as well as a significant negative relationship between sword length and heart and gill mass. Our results suggest that interspecific variation in sword length is not costly for this aspect of swimming performance, but further studies should examine potential costs for other types of locomotion and other components of Darwinian fitness (e.g., survivorship, life span).","[Oufiero, Christopher E.; Meredith, Robert W.; Jugo, Kristine N.; Tran, Paulina; Chappell, Mark A.; Springer, Mark S.; Reznick, David N.; Garland, Theodore, Jr.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Oufiero, CE (corresponding author), Towson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Towson, MD 21252 USA.",coufiero@towson.edu,,"Garland, Theodore/0000-0002-7916-3552; reznick, david/0000-0002-1144-0568",UCR Graduate School; UCR Biology Shoemaker Award; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DDIG IOS-0709788],"We thank the labs of M.

The South American fur seal (SAFS) and the South American sea lion (SASL) are two otariid species with similar ecology that coexist in sympatry in the Uruguayan coast. These two species have contrasting trends and widely different population sizes. The underlying reasons for these population trends, unique in their geographical ranges, remain unknown. We studied the foraging ecology of these otariid species over 2 years at the individual- and population levels using the isotopic ratios (delta C-13-delta N-15) in whiskers of both sexes. We compared the isotope ratios between species and sexes and used several metrics to characterise the degree of overlap and distinctiveness in the use of isotopic niche space at the individual- and population levels. Interspecific trophic niche overlap was minimal, thus ruling out interspecific competition as the cause for the contrasting population trends of both species. At the intraspecific level, both species had sexual segregation in their foraging areas, but each species had a large overlap in the isotopic niches between sexes. While SAFS had a wider niche and generalist individuals, SASL had the narrower niche with a higher degree of individual specialisation. Behavioural constraints during the breeding season, intraspecific competition and a major dependence on resources of the Uruguayan coastal shelf may explain why SASL had a higher trophic individual specialisation and a larger vulnerability in a heavily exploited habitat by fisheries and, by consequence, a locally declining population trend.","[Franco-Trecu, Valentina] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Secc Etol, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay; [Aurioles-Gamboa, David] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, Lab Ecol Pinnipedos Burney J Le Boeuf, La Paz, Baja California, Mexico; [Inchausti, Pablo] Univ Republ, Dept Ecol & Evolucin, CURE, Maldonado 20000, Uruguay","Inchausti, P (corresponding author), Univ Republ, Dept Ecol & Evolucin, CURE, Tacuarembo S-N, Maldonado 20000, Uruguay.",pablo.inchausti.f@gmail.com,"Franco-Trecu, Valentina/L-4649-2019; Franco-Trecu, Valentina/N-5266-2019","Franco-Trecu, Valentina/0000-0003-1791-010X; ","CSIC (Council for Scientific Research) of the Universidad de la Republica; Rufford Maurice Lain Foundation; ONG Yaqu-pacha; Heidelberg Zoo; ANII (National Agency for Research and Innovation, Uruguay); PEDECIBA (Programme for the Development of Basic Sciences, Uruguay)","We are very grateful with L.

Here, we present a functional link between rising temperature and the prey detection ability of echolocating bats. The maximum distance for echo-based prey detection is physically determined by sound attenuation. Attenuation is more pronounced for high-frequency sound, such as echolocation, and is a nonlinear function of both call frequency and ambient temperature. Hence, the prey detection ability, and thus possibly the foraging efficiency, of echolocating bats and susceptible to rising temperatures through climate change. Using present-day climate data and projected temperature rises, we modelled this effect for the entire range of bat call frequencies and climate zones around the globe. We show that depending on call frequency, the prey detection volume of bats will either decrease or increase: species calling above a cross-over frequency will lose and species emitting lower frequencies will gain prey detection volume, with crossover frequency and magnitude depending on the local climatic conditions. Within local species assemblages, this may cause a change in community composition. Global warming can thus directly affect the prey detection ability of individual bats and indirectly their interspecific interactions with competitors and prey.","[Luo, Jinhong; Koselj, Klemen; Zsebok, Sandor; Siemers, Bjoern M.; Goerlitz, Holger R.] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Sensory Ecol Grp, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany; [Luo, Jinhong] NE Normal Univ, Jilin Key Lab Anim Resource Conservat & Utilizat, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Zsebok, Sandor] MTA ELTE MTM Ecol Res Grp, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary","Goerlitz, HR (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Sensory Ecol Grp, Eberhard Gwinner Str, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany.",hgoerlitz@orn.mpg.de,"Goerlitz, Holger/F-8973-2017; Zsebok, Sandor/H-4768-2015","Goerlitz, Holger/0000-0002-9677-8073; Zsebok, Sandor/0000-0003-4463-4753; Luo, Jinhong/0000-0002-2780-475X",China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council; Max Planck SocietyMax Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission; International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Organismal Biology,"This study was supported by the China Scholarship Council (J.

Blenny species used different sized holes; however, the average diameter and depth of holes used by the smallest and largest species differed by only 4 and 25 mm, respectively, indicating interspecific differences in suitable refuge can be very subtle. Both hole diameter and depth were positively related to total length of fish, suggesting use of holes relates to interspecific differences in body size. Total abundance of blennies was best explained by a general linear model that included either the number of holes or total habitat area on individual micro-atolls, predictor variables that were positively correlated with each other. However, the relative importance of variables differed among the three species, feeding area being most important for S. patzneri, feeding area and number of holes for E. stictus, and variance in hole diameter being the best explanatory variable for G. delicatulus abundance. The number of blenny species on a micro-atoll was best explained by variance in hole diameter, emphasizing the influence of refuge size variety in fish diversity. It is likely that subtle habitat partitioning, which relates to interspecific differences in body size, contributes to the co-existence of blenny species within the same microhabitat, but presence of holes is unlikely to regulate abundance of these fish.","[Wilson, S.

In particular, studies that have attempted to modulate ROS-induced damage, either upwards or downwards, using antioxidant or genetic approaches, generally do not show a predictable effect on lifespan. Here, we investigated whether dietary supplementation with either vitamin E (a-tocopherol) or vitamin C (ascorbic acid) affected oxidative damage and lifespan in short-tailed field voles, Microtus agrestis. We predicted that antioxidant supplementation would reduce ROS-induced oxidative damage and increase lifespan relative to unsupplemented controls. Antioxidant supplementation for nine months reduced hepatic lipid peroxidation, but DNA oxidative damage to hepatocytes and lymphocytes was unaffected. Surprisingly, antioxidant supplementation significantly shortened lifespan in voles maintained under both cold (7 +/- 2 degrees C) and warm (22 +/- 28 degrees C) conditions. These data further question the predictions of free-radical theory of ageing and critically, given our previous research in mice, indicate that similar levels of antioxidants can induce widely different interspecific effects on lifespan.","[Selman, Colin; McLaren, Jane S.; Speakman, John R.] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland; [Collins, Andrew R.; Duthie, Garry G.] Univ Aberdeen, Rowett Inst Nutr & Hlth, Aberdeen AB21 9SB, Scotland; [Speakman, John R.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, State Key Lab Mol Dev Biol, Beijing 100100, Peoples R China","Speakman, JR (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, Scotland.",j.speakman@abdn.ac.uk,"Speakman, John R./A-9494-2008","Speakman, John R./0000-0002-2457-1823; Collins, Andrew/0000-0001-5916-6871; Selman, Colin/0000-0002-8727-0593",BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC),"We thank Duncan Wood, Shona Fleming, Jodie Fleming, Susanne Lumsden and Paula Redman (Biological Sciences, University of Aberdeen), and Nick Vaughan, Sharon Wood and Philip Morrice (Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Aberdeen).

In Experiment 1, the two sets were presented simultaneously, under water, and they were visually (condition 1) or echoically (condition 2) available at the time of choice. In experiment 2, the two sets were presented above the water, successively (condition 1) or sequentially, item-by-item (condition 2), so that they were not visually available at the time of choice (condition I) or at any time throughout the experiment (condition 2).

LEPIDOPTERA; GLOMERATA L.; WASP,"Obligate hyperparasitoids are widely considered an important ecological disturbance to biological control of insect pests, as they develop at the expense of primary parasitoids. However, supporting evidence is largely derived from direct trophic interactions in simple food webs. Yet, a multitude of insect pest populations simultaneously support development of several primary parasitoid species in horticultural and natural systems. Since primary parasitoid species in a community can differ in vulnerability to obligate hyperparasitoids, it is desirable to establish if the invulnerable primary parasitoids can take advantage of reduced competition from affected species by increasing their contribution to total primary parasitism levels thereby mitigating effects of hyperparasitism on biological control. To investigate this question, populations of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus) (Plutellidae), its primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids were monitored on unsprayed cabbage plots at weekly intervals over six consecutive years. Cotesia vestalis (Haliday) (Braconidae), a dominant primary parasitoid in this system, was a secondary host to three obligate hyperparasitoids: Mesochorus sp. (Ichneumonidae), Eurytoma sp. (Euiytomidae) and Pteromalus sp. (Pteromalidae). The higher efficiency of C vestalis in utilizing younger host larvae at lower hyperparasitism levels limited host availability to other major primary parasitoids. But, as hyperparasitism levels increased and its populations declined, populations of Oomyzus sokolowskii (Kurdjumov) (Eulophidae) and Diadromus collaris (Gravenhorst) (Ichneumonidae) increased significantly as they parasitized a greater proportion of available hosts. As a consequence, the impact of hyperparasitoids did not result in trophic cascades, as their impact on total primary parasitism levels and infestation levels was insignificant. This study shows that primary parasitoid species that are invulnerable to hyperparasitism can take over the function of vulnerable ones in communities where interspecific interactions among species are strong. Thus, an approach that considers both direct and indirect effects of hyperparasitoids in primary parasitoid communities improves our understanding of the net impact of hyperparasitism on biological control of insect pests.

This review aims to revisit and reanalyze the patterns and processes that are subjacent to the interesting ecological and evolutionary properties of these species. Biotic and abiotic niche properties of some species were reanalyzed in face of ecological niche modeling approaches in order to get some insights into their ecological evolution. A test of the potential of DNA-Barcoding provided evidences that this technology may be a way of overcoming difficulties related to cryptic species differentiation.

Such facilitation by fire of seedling establishment is known as the ashbed effect. Because the ashbed effect might involve disruption of common mycorrhizal networks, we hypothesized that in the absence of fire, intact rain forest arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) networks inhibit E. tetrodonta seedlings. Although arbuscular mycorrhizas predominate in the rain forest, common tree species of the northern Australian savannas (including adult E. tetrodonta) host ectomycorrhizas. To test our hypothesis, we grew E. tetrodonta and Ceiba pentandra (an AM-responsive species used to confirm treatments) separately in microcosms of ambient or methyl-bromide fumigated rain forest soil with or without severing potential mycorrhizal fungus connections to an AM nurse plant, Litsea glutinosa. As expected, C. pentandra formed mycorrhizas in all treatments but had the most root colonization and grew fastest in ambient soil. E. tetrodonta seedlings also formed AM in all treatments, but severing hyphae in fumigated soil produced the least colonization and the best growth. Three of ten E. tetrodonta seedlings in ambient soil with intact network hyphae died. Because foliar chlorosis was symptomatic of iron deficiency, after 130 days we began to fertilize half the E. tetrodonta seedlings in ambient soil with an iron solution. Iron fertilization completely remedied chlorosis and stimulated leaf growth. Our microcosm results suggest that in intact rain forest, common AM networks mediate belowground competition and AM fungi may exacerbate iron deficiency, thereby enhancing resistance to E. tetrodonta invasion. Common AM networks-previously unrecognized as contributors to the ashbed effect-probably help to maintain the rain forest-savanna boundary.","[Janos, David P.; Aristizabal, Catalina] Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Scott, John] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Bowman, David M.

However, it is not clear whether, when confronted with similar circumstances (e. g., nestling demand), blue and great tits show similar preferences for a particular caterpillar type. In this 2-y study, we compare the diet of both tit species in detail by controlling for hatching date and brood size. We also examine how the contribution of caterpillars and spiders to the diet is related to nestling development. A positive relationship was found between the percentage of spiders in the diet and nestling tarsus length in both species, reinforcing the idea that neonatal nutrition could have a strong influence on nestling phenotype (e.g., offspring size). Such a correlation may arise because spiders contain a high level of taurine, an essential nutrient in the early development of young, and/or this prey type contains more calcium than other food items, which may affect the rate of nestling bone mineralization. Blue tits fed their young double the number of tortricid larvae in comparison with great tits, whereas the latter showed a clear preference for noctuids and exploited, with a low frequency, a type of larvae not consumed by blue tits, hairy caterpillars (Lasiocampidae). Our results point to resource partitioning by these species in this forest ecosystem and contribute to a better understanding of feeding ecology of titmice, which is particularly timely in a global warming context.","[Garcia-Navas, Vicente; Ferrer, Esperanza S.; Jose Sanz, Juan] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Ambientales & Bioquim, Dept Ciencias Ambientales, E-45071 Toledo, Spain","Garcia-Navas, V (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Ambientales & Bioquim, Dept Ciencias Ambientales, Ave Carlos III S-N, E-45071 Toledo, Spain.",vicente.garcianavas@gmail.com,"GARCIA-NAVAS, VICENTE/B-9372-2011; Sanz, Juan Jose/B-8441-2011; Ferrer, Esperanza/C-1196-2015","Sanz, Juan Jose/0000-0003-2576-4050; Garcia-Navas, Vicente/0000-0002-9362-2663",FPI predoctoral fellowship (Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN)-European Social Fund); MICINNSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [GCL2007-61395],We are grateful to C.

We describe an approach to study the roles of biotic and abiotic factors in establishing elevational ranges, and to improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on these communities. As a framework we use Hutchinson's concept of the fundamental niche (determined by the match between the physical environment and the organism's physiological and biophysical characteristics) and realized niche (the subset of the fundamental niche determined by biotic interactions). Using tropical birds as an example, we propose a method for estimating fundamental niches and discuss five biotic interactions that we expect to influence distributions of tropical montane animals: predation, competition, parasites and pathogens, mutualisms, and habitat associations. The effects of biotic factors on elevational ranges have been studied to some extent, but there is little information on physiological responses of tropical montane animals. It will be necessary to understand all of these ecological constraints in concert to predict current and future elevational ranges and potential threats to montane species. Given the importance of tropical mountains as global biodiversity hotspots, we argue that this area of research requires urgent attention.","[Jankowski, Jill E.] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Londono, Gustavo A.; Robinson, Scott K.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Londono, Gustavo A.; Robinson, Scott K.] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Chappell, Mark A.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Jankowski, JE (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",jankowsk@biodiversity.ubc.ca,,,NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Biodiversity Research Centre of Univ. of British Columbia; Univ. of FloridaUniversity of Florida; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1120682],We thank the numerous assistants who have helped with the collection of data presented on bird life-history characteristics along tropical elevational gradients.

The present study analyses the interactions in trophic ecology between the endangered Iberian toothcarp Aphanius iberus and the highly invasive eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki at a sympatric site where they have been verified to coexist for more than 10 yr. The existence of a habitat gradient in the system, mainly determined by salinity and accompanied by different proportions of the 2 fish species, made it possible to analyse dietary variation along that gradient. Overall results from gut content analysis showed a high degree of similarity in the spring diets of both species. However, the mosquitofish appeared to be a better competitor for food resources, as individuals of this exotic species presented a lower proportion of empty guts and their guts contained more food. Possibly associated with a certain degree of spatial segregation, a shift in the diet composition of the toothcarp and the mosquitofish was observed among sites with different salinities and relative abundances of both species. In general, in sectors of the channel with lower salinity levels and mosquitofish as the dominant species, toothcarp seemed to display more benthic feeding and, consequently, the diets of both species were less overlapped. Under such conditions, the toothcarp diminished feeding intensity and diet diversity. Thus, this native species could be subjected to a decrease in its population viability as a direct consequence of trophic relationship with the invasive fish.","[Ruiz-Navarro, Ana; Torralva, Mar; Oliva-Paterna, Francisco J.] Univ Murcia, Dept Zool & Antropol Fis, E-30100 Murcia, Spain","Ruiz-Navarro, A (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Dept Zool & Antropol Fis, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",anaruiz@um.es,"Ruiz-Navarro, Ana/AAU-7982-2021; TORRALVA, MAR/R-5545-2019","Ruiz-Navarro, Ana/0000-0002-3872-6080; Oliva-Paterna, Francisco J./0000-0001-8288-5321",Spanish Ministry of EducationSpanish Government [FPU AP2006-01528],"We thank Institut d'Ecologia Aquatica of the University of Girona for the study of the invertebrate community and for help in prey identification, J.

In the natural environment microbes typically live in small local populations with limited and unpredictable nutrient supply and high death rates. Here, we show that these conditions can produce oscillations in microbial population dynamics, even for a single population. For a large population, with deterministic growth dynamics, our model predicts transient (damped) oscillations. For a small population, demographic noise causes these oscillations to be sustained indefinitely. We show that the same mechanism can produce sustained stochastic oscillations in a two-species, nutrient-cycling microbial ecosystem. Our results suggest that oscillatory population dynamics may be a common feature of small microbial populations in the natural environment, even in the absence of complex interspecies interactions or spatial structuring.

Depending upon the differences in host quality and transmission asymmetries, as well as the balance between intra- and interspecific transmission, the evolution of specialist or generalist strategies is predicted. Using a trypanosome parasite of bumblebees, we ask how host quality and transmission networks relate to parasite population structure across host species, and thus the potential for the evolution of specialist strains adapted to different host species. Host species differed in quality, with parasite growth varying across host species. Highly asymmetric transmission networks, together with differences in host quality, likely explain local population structure of the parasite across host species. However, parasite population structure across years was highly dynamic, with parasite populations varying significantly from one year to the next within individual species at a given site. This suggests that, while host quality and transmission may provide the opportunity for short-term host specialization by the parasite, repeated bottlenecking of the parasite, in combination with its own reproductive biology, overrides these smaller scale effects, resulting in the evolution of a generalist parasite.","[Ruiz-Gonzalez, Mario X.; Brown, Mark J.

To investigate this paradox, we collected delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotope signatures from 649 specimens representing 32 loricariid genera and 82 species from 19 local assemblages distributed across South America. We calculated vectors representing the distance and direction of each specimen relative to the delta N-15/delta C-13 centroid for its local assemblage, and then examined the evolutionary diversification of loricariids across assemblage isotope niche space by regressing the mean vector for each genus in each assemblage onto a phylogeny reconstructed from osteological characters. Results: Loricariids displayed a total range of delta N-15 assemblage centroid deviation spanning 4.9%, which is within the tissue-diet discrimination range known for Loricariidae, indicating that they feed at a similar trophic level and that delta N-15 largely reflects differences in their dietary protein content. Total range of delta C-13 deviation spanned 7.4%, which is less than the minimum range reported for neotropical river fish communities, suggesting that loricariids selectively assimilate a restricted subset of the full basal resource spectrum available to fishes. Phylogenetic regression of assemblage centroid-standardized vectors for delta N-15 and delta C-13 revealed that loricariid genera with allopatric distributions in disjunct river basins partition basal resources in an evolutionarily conserved manner concordant with patterns of jaw morphological specialization and with evolutionary diversification via ecological radiation. Conclusions: Trophic partitioning along elemental/nutritional gradients may provide an important mechanism of dietary segregation and evolutionary diversification among loricariids and perhaps other taxonomic groups of apparently generalist detritivores and herbivores. Evolutionary patterns among the Loricariidae show a high degree of trophic niche conservatism, indicating that evolutionary lineage affiliation can be a strong predictor of how basal consumers segregate trophic niche space.","[Lujan, Nathan K.; Winemiller, Kirk O.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Lujan, Nathan K.; Armbruster, Jonathan W.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Lujan, Nathan K.] Royal Ontario Museum, Dept Nat Hist, Toronto, ON M5S 2C6, Canada","Lujan, NK (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",nklujan@gmail.com,,"Winemiller, Kirk/0000-0003-0236-5129","Planetary Biodiversity Inventory: All Catfish Species [NSF DEB-0315963]; NSF grantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OISE-1064578, DEB-0107751]; estate of George and Carolyn Kelso via the International Sportfish Fund","We gratefully acknowledge D.

We demonstrated here the presence of periodic oscillations in small mammal populations in eastern Poland using 22-year (1986-2007) trapping data from marginal meadow and river valley grasslands located in the extensive temperate woodland of BiaowieA1/4a Primeval Forest. The two most common species inhabiting meadows and river valleys, root vole Microtus oeconomus and common shrew Sorex araneus, exhibited synchronous periodic changes, characterised by a 3-year time lag as indicated by an autocorrelation function. Moreover, the cycles of these two species were synchronous within both habitats. Population dynamics of the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius was not cyclic. However, this species regularly reached maximum density 1 year before the synchronized peak of root voles and common shrews, which may suggest the existence of interspecific competition. Dynamics of all three species was dominated by direct density-dependent process, whereas delayed density dependent feedback was significant only in the root vole and common shrew. Climatic factors acting in winter and spring (affecting mainly survival and initial reproduction rates) were more important than those acting in summer and autumn and affected significantly only the common shrew. High temperatures in winter and spring had positive effects on autumn-to-autumn changes in abundance of this species, whereas deep snow in combination with high rainfall in spring negatively affected population increase rates in common shrew.","[Zub, K.; Jedrzejewska, B.; Jedrzejewski, W.; Barton, K.

The leafmining flies Liriomyza sativae and Liriomyza trifolii have become serious invasive agricultural pests throughout the world. Where both species have invaded the same region, one predominates over the other. Although L. sativae invaded Hainan Island of China first, it recently has been displaced by the newly invasive L. trifolii. We hypothesized that differential susceptibilities to insecticides could be causing this demographic shift. Methodology/Principal Findings: Avermectin and cyromazine are the most commonly used insecticides to manage leafminers, with laboratory bioassays demonstrating that L. trifolii is significantly less susceptible to these key insecticides than is L. sativae. In trials where similar numbers of larvae of both species infested plants, which subsequently were treated with the insecticides, the eclosing adults were predominately L. trifolii, yet similar numbers of adults of both species eclosed from control plants. The species composition was then surveyed in two regions where L. trifolii has just begun to invade and both species are still common. In field trials, both species occurred in similar proportions before insecticide treatments began. Following applications of avermectin and cyromazine, almost all eclosing adults were L. trifolii in those treatment plots. In control plots, similar numbers of adults of the two species eclosed, lending further credence to the hypothesis that differential insecticide susceptibilities could be driving the ongoing displacement of L. sativae by L. trifolii. Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that differential insecticide susceptibility can lead to rapid shifts in the demographics of pest complexes. Thus, successful pest management requires the identification of pest species to understand the outcome of insecticide applications. These results further demonstrate the importance of considering anthropogenic factors in the outcome of interspecific interactions.","[Gao, Yulin; Wei, Qingbo; Yu, Wenyan; Lei, Zhongren] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Inst Plant Protect, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Reitz, Stuart R.] ARS, Ctr Med Agr & Vet Entomol, USDA, Tallahassee, FL USA","Gao, YL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Inst Plant Protect, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",zrlei@ippcaas.cn,"Reitz, Stuart/AAC-4467-2019",,National Key Basic Research Program (973 Projects) [2009CB119004]; China Agriculture Research System [CARS-25-B-07],"This work was supported in part by the National Key Basic Research Program (973 Projects Grant 2009CB119004) and the China Agriculture Research System (CARS-25-B-07).

Previous models have examined the ecological and demographic conditions leading to hybridization and introgression, but few have examined the role of behavior. Alternative mating behaviors are common throughout the animal kingdom but have rarely been recognized as a potential mechanism for hybridization. We developed an individual-based genetic model to examine the hypothesis that extra-pair copulations (EPCs) can lead to hybridization and genetic introgression even when assortative mating preferences are intact. Our model showed that female choice, whether pre- or post-copulation, reinforced species boundaries and that hybrids were relatively uncommon when no EPCs occurred. However, when EPCs were introduced into the model, the proportion of hybrids in the population depended on the strength of female mate or sperm choice, the strength of male pursuit of EPCs, and habitat-induced effects on the species composition of the neighborhood. As predicted, male pursuit of EPCs caused extensive introgression, but female preference for conspecific paternity reinforced species differences. Inclusion of mitochondrial markers of species identity revealed significant effects of interspecific and intersexual behavior during EPCs on the direction of introgression. These results suggest that an alternative mating tactic may have major effects on the level of genetic homogenization and can cause local extinction of a species.","[Hartman, Patricia J.; Wetzel, Daniel P.; Crowley, Philip H.; Westneat, David F.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Wetzel, DP (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, 101 TH Morgan Bldg, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",dan.wetzel@uky.edu,"Hartman, Patricia/N-9986-2019; Hartman, Patricia/I-5645-2013","Hartman, Patricia/0000-0003-2611-106X; Hartman, Patricia/0000-0003-2611-106X; Wetzel, Daniel/0000-0001-6375-6743",Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources,"We thank SK Diep, G Garcia-Ramos, IRK Stewart, K Thompson, and other members of the UK evolutionary ecology group for helpful discussion throughout the development of this model.

Plants exhibit a wide variety in traits at different organizational levels. Intraspecific and interspecific studies have potential to demonstrate functional relationships and trade-offs amongst traits, with potential consequences for growth. However, the distinction between the correlative and functional nature of trait covariation presents a challenge because traits interact in complex ways. 2. We present an intraspecific study on Scots pine branches and use functional multi-trait concepts to organize and understand trait interactions and their impacts on growth. Branch-level traits were assessed for 97 branches from 12 Scots pine sites across Europe. 3. To test alternative hypotheses on cause-effect relationships between anatomical traits, hydraulic traits and branch growth, we measured for each branch: the tracheid hydraulic diameter, double cell wall thickness, cell lumen span area, wood density, cavitation vulnerability, wood-specific hydraulic conductivity, the leaf area to sapwood area ratio and branch growth. We used mixed linear effect models and path models to show how anatomical traits determine hydraulic traits and, in turn, how those traits influence growth. 4. Tracheid hydraulic diameter was the best predictor of cavitation vulnerability (R-2 = 0 09 explained by path model) and specific conductivity (R-2 = 0 19) amongst anatomical traits. Leaf area to sapwood area ratio had the strongest direct effect on branch growth (R-2 = 0 19) and was positively associated with the tracheid hydraulic diameter (R-2 = 0 22). A number of bivariate correlations between traits could be explained by these functional relationships amongst traits. 5. The plasticity in tracheid hydraulic diameter (10.0-15.1 mu m) and leaf area to sapwood area ratio (600-6051 cm(2) cm(-2)) and the maintenance of a minimum leaf water potential (between) 2 and) -2.5 MPa) appear to drive the anatomical and hydraulic traits of Scots pine across Europe. These properties are major drivers of the functional trait network underlying the growth variation amongst pine branches and thus possibly contribute to the ecological success of pines at a local and continental scale.","[Sterck, Frank J.; Gerrits, Pieter; Sass-Klaassen, Ute] Wageningen Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Studies, PO 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, CREAF Ecol Unit, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Cochard, Herve; Poyatos, Rafael] INRA, UMR PIAF 547, F-63100 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Martinez-Vilalta, Jordi; Mencuccini, Maurizio] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3JN, Midlothian, Scotland; [Cochard, Herve] Univ Blaise Pascal, UMR PIAF 547, F-63177 Aubiere, France; [Zweifel, Roman] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Herrero, Asier] Univ Granada, Dept Ecol, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Korhonen, Janne F.

A trade-off between maintenance of energy balance and digestion efficiency has been recently proposed to affect thermoregulation in these animals. On the other hand, competition for basking sites has been described between Iberian turtles and the introduced red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans). T. scripta negatively interferes with basking behavior of native turtles and benefits from a greater capacity to retain body heat, which may likely result in thermoregulatory advantages for the introduced sliders. Consequently, complex effects and alterations in metabolic rates of native turtles might derive from a deficient basking behavior. We compared the basking requirements of the endangered native Spanish terrapin (Mauremys leprosa) and those of the introduced red-eared slider, analyzing the upper set point temperature (LISP) (defined as the body temperature at which basking ceased) of both native and introduced turtles, under feeding and fasting conditions. We found higher values of LISP in the native species, and a reduction of this temperature associated with food deprivation in the two turtle species. This adjustment of thermoregulatory behavior to the nutritional status found in freshwater turtles suggests that ectotherms benefit from metabolic depression as an adaptive mechanism to preserve energy during periods of fasting. However, a reduction in metabolic rates induced by competition with sliders might lead M. leprosa to a prolonged deficiency of their physiological functions, thus incurring increased predation risk and health costs, and ultimately favoring the recession of this native species in Mediterranean habitats.

Our understanding of the contribution of interspecific interactions to functional diversity in nature lags behind our knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns. Although two-species mutualisms are found in all types of ecosystems, the study of their ecological influences on other community members has mostly been limited to third species, while their influence on entire communities remains largely unexplored. 2. We hypothesized that mutualistic interactions between two respective ant species and an epiphyte mediate the biological traits composition of entire invertebrate communities that use the same host plant, thereby affecting food webs and functional diversity at the community level. 3. Aechmea mertensii (Bromeliaceae) is both a phytotelm ('plant-held water') and an ant-garden epiphyte. We sampled 111 bromeliads (111 aquatic invertebrate communities) associated with either the ant Pachycondyla goeldii or Camponotus femoratus. The relationships between ants, bromeliads and invertebrate abundance data were examined using a redundancy analysis. Biological traits information for invertebrates was structured using a fuzzy-coding technique, and a co-inertia analysis between traits and abundance data was used to interpret functional differences in bromeliad ecosystems. 4. The vegetative traits of A. mertensii depended on seed dispersion by C. femoratus and P. goeldii along a gradient of local conditions. The ant partner selected sets of invertebrates with traits that were best adapted to the bromeliads' morphology, and so the composition of the biological traits of invertebrate phytotelm communities depends on the identity of the ant partner. Biological traits suggest a bottom-up control of community structure in C. femoratus-associated phytotelmata and a greater structuring role for predatory invertebrates in P. goeldii-associated plants. 5. This study presents new information showing that two-species mutualisms affect the functional diversity of a much wider range of organisms. Most biological systems form complex networks where nodes (e. g. species) are more or less closely linked to each other, either directly or indirectly, through intermediate nodes. Our observations provide community-level information about biological interactions and functional diversity, and perspectives for further observations intended to examine whether large-scale changes in interacting species/community structure over broad geographical and anthropogenic gradients affect ecosystem functions.","[Cereghino, Regis; Pelozuelo, Laurent; Segura, Caroline; Bosc, Christopher] Univ Toulouse, EcoLab, Lab Ecol Fonct & Environm, UMR 5245, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Leroy, Celine; Dejean, Alain] Ecol Forets Guyane UMR 8172, F-97379 Kourou, France; [Carrias, Jean-Francois; Corbara, Bruno] Univ Blaise Pascal, Lab Microorganismes Genome & Environm, UMR 6023, F-63171 Aubiere, France","Cereghino, R (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, EcoLab, Lab Ecol Fonct & Environm, UMR 5245, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse, France.",cereghin@cict.fr,"CEREGHINO, Regis/G-9500-2011; Leroy, Celine/I-4857-2016; Carrias, Jean-Francois/AAT-2738-2021","Leroy, Celine/0000-0003-4859-8040; Carrias, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-6201-1544; Dejean, Alain/0000-0002-3561-2248; CORBARA, Bruno/0000-0003-4232-8234; Cereghino, Regis/0000-0003-3981-3159",French Centre National de la Recherche ScientifiqueCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) [2ID]; European CommunityEuropean Commission,This study was funded by the Programme Amazonie II of the French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (Project 2ID) and the Programme Convergence 2007-2013 (Region Guyane) from the European Community (Project DEGA).

Although the evidence of greater phenotypic plasticity in invasive plants is considerable, it is not yet conclusive. We used a meta-analysis approach to evaluate whether invasive plant species show greater phenotypic plasticity than their native or non-invasive counterparts. The outcome of such interspecific comparisons may be biased when phylogenetic relatedness is not taken into account. Consequently, species pairs belonged to the same genus, tribe or family. The meta-analysis included 93 records from 35 studies reporting plastic responses to light, nutrients, water, CO2, herbivory and support availability. Contrary to what is often assumed, overall, phenotypic plasticity was similar between invasive plants and native or non-invasive closely related species. The same result was found when separate analyses were conducted for trait plasticity to nutrients, light and water availability. Thus, invasive plant species and their native or non-invasive counterparts are equally capable of displaying functional responses to environmental heterogeneity. The colonization of a wide range of environments by invasive plants could be due to their capacity to undergo adaptive ecotypic differentiation rather than to their ability to display plastic responses. Alternatively, phenotypic plasticity might play a role in plant invasion, but only during the initial phases, when tolerance of the novel environment is essential for plant survival. Afterwards, once alien plants are identified as invaders, the magnitude of phenotypic plasticity might be reduced after selection of the optimum phenotypes in each habitat. The identification of plant traits that consistently predict invasiveness might be a futile task because different traits favor invasiveness in different environments. Approaches at the local scale, focusing on the ecology of specific invasive plants, could be more fruitful than global macro-analyses.","[Palacio-Lopez, Kattia; Gianoli, Ernesto] Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, Concepcion, Chile; [Gianoli, Ernesto] Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, La Serena, Chile","Palacio-Lopez, K (corresponding author), Univ Concepcion, Dept Bot, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile.",egianoli@userena.cl,"Gianoli, Ernesto/A-7984-2015","Gianoli, Ernesto/0000-0003-4246-8640",CONICYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [M-58080056],"KPL was supported by a CONICYT fellowship (M-58080056).

Geographic information systems (GIS) have recently proved useful for estimating the environmental niche of species across broad geographic regions. However, the application of these niche-based GIS techniques has yet to be extensively applied to local systems. The assumptions of the methods are transferable across scales: species exist across a range of habitats, and these habitats represent a gradient of suitability that can be characterized using multivariate environmental data in association with known species occurrences. 2. Habitat availability and species' niche characteristics are often considered to be important predictors of population density. However, seasonal habitat variability and stochastic events have been hypothesized to limit interactions among species and confound the relationship between available habitat, species niche characteristics and community structure. This research examines the relationship between environmental niche breadth and niche position and population density among species of stream fishes in a seasonally variable environment using a novel application of fine-scale GIS data. 3. Niche breadth and niche position were estimated for 11 species in a local assemblage using five fine-scale (0 center dot 5 m) GIS-based environmental data sets collected during four different times of the year (July, October, January, April). We compared niche measures to variation in population density among species to determine whether environmental niche characteristics, in the context of available habitat, explain variation in numbers of individuals among species. 4. Variation in population density among species in the October sample was predicted by niche breadth measures (R2 = 0 center dot 752), while variation in population density among species in the January sample was predicted by a model incorporating measures of both niche breadth and niche position (R2 = 0 center dot 953). Measures of niche breadth and niche position were not correlated with variation in population density in the July and April samples. 5. Species presence and local abundance are often assumed to be predictable based on the availability of suitable habitat. However, little effort has been directed at understanding the influence of both niche breadth and niche position on local abundance. Our results suggest that the amount and distribution of available habitat can be a strong predictor of interspecific variation in population density, even in seasonally variable environments.","[Knouft, Jason H.; Caruso, Nicholas M.; Dupre, Patrick J.; Anderson, Karl R.; Trumbo, Daryl R.; Puccinelli, Jean] St Louis Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63103 USA","Knouft, JH (corresponding author), St Louis Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63103 USA.",jknouft@slu.edu,,"Caruso, Nicholas/0000-0002-1059-6907",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0844644]; Saint Louis University; Washington University's Tyson Research Center,We thank Washington University's Tyson Research Center for access to Labarque Creek and support during this research.

Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are chemicals that interfere with proper hormonal functioning in exposed animals. They enter the natural environment through multiple sources, and many non-target wildlife species are exposed to them via several modes. Exposure causes altered hormone levels, importantly gonadal hormones, resulting in changed reproductive characteristics. 2. Vertebrate male mating signals convey important mate quality information to females. These signals are dependent on androgens for their production and maintenance. Female responses to signals depend on oestrogens. Disrupting these pathways jeopardizes signal production and reception, which has implications for mating system ecology. 3. Besides affecting various aspects of the vertebrate physiology, EDCs can impair hormonal functioning by binding to or blocking hormone receptors, or by altering production and function of hormones or hormone receptors. 4. We consider the ecological implications of multi-generational signal disruption by EDCs. Altered signals can influence population dynamics and sex ratios; local extinctions are possible. Community-level dynamics may be affected via interspecific dependence on signals or population fluctuations. 5. We then address the evolutionary effects of EDC-altered male mating signals in vertebrates and discuss how females may respond to altered signals over evolutionary time. Trans-generational reduction in signal reliability can lead to reduced preference and eventual loss of the signal trait and to the evolution of new traits as signals of mate quality. Genetic divergence between endocrine disrupted and undisrupted populations may result, perhaps giving rise to speciation. 6. Finally, we recommend areas of research to further explore some of the issues addressed in this review. We suggest field surveys to document existing alterations in mating systems and genetic divergence in endocrine disrupted populations. Long-term mesocosm studies and mathematical models would be useful to predict the fate of mating signals and female responses as a result of prolonged endocrine disruption. EDCs have been the focus of ecotoxicology for some time now, and we feel that this analysis should now enter the realm of evolutionary biology to determine the subtle, yet far-reaching effects on exposed non-target wildlife.","[Shenoy, Kausalya; Crowley, Philip H.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Shenoy, K (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, 101 Morgan Bldg, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",kay.yellowtoad@gmail.com,"Shenoy, Kausalya/D-4085-2015",,University of Kentucky,"We thank David Westneat, David Weisrock, Charles Fox, Nicholas McLetchie and David Maehr for comments on the manuscript.

We review what is known regarding the impact of intraspecific diversity on grassland community structure, using an ancient limestone pasture as a focal example. Two genotype-dependent effects appear to modify community structure in this system. First, the abundance of individual constituent species can depend upon the combined influence of direct genetic effects stemming from individuals within the population. Second, the outcome of localized interspecific interactions occurring within the community can depend on the genotypes of participating individuals (indicating indirect genetic effects). Only genotypic interactions are thought to be capable of allowing the long-term coexistence of both genotypes and species. We discuss the implications of these effects for the maintenance of diversity in grasslands. Next, we present new observations indicating that losses of genotypic diversity from each of two species can be predicted by the abundance of other coexisting species within experimental grassland communities. These results suggest genotype-specific responses to abundance in other coexisting species. We conclude that both direct and indirect genetic effects are likely to shape community structure and species coexistence in grasslands, implying tight linkage between fine-scale genetic and community structure.","[Whitlock, Raj; Grime, J.

Various metrics describing niche overlap, breadth, and position have been developed during the last decades, and these have played a central role in our understanding of community organisation. However, owing to some obvious limitations in these metrics, there is a need for further development of the niche concept to provide new insights into the relationships between species richness (SR), community organisation, and underlying processes. We introduce a new metric, variability in niche positions (VNP) within local communities, describing the extent to which species positions vary in environmentally determined niche space. VNP is measured as the standard deviation of species scores along a multivariate ordination axis calculated over all species in a local community. Regardless of its simplicity, the VNP metric describes novel features in niche differentiation and species locations in environmental niche space. Therefore, it complements other measures, such as niche complementarity and overlap. Based on a few premises about species interactions and body size, we hypothesised that VNP has predictable relationships with SR. The relationships were supported by empirical data on aquatic organisms. Of the studied organism groups, lake fishes showed the strongest VNP-SR relationships, followed by lake molluscs and pond phytoplankton. Stream bryophytes and stream macroinvertebrates also showed significant, yet weak, VNP-SR relationships, but there were no significant relationships in pond zooplankton and stream diatoms. The strength of the VNP-SR relationship showed a positive correlation with the body mass of organisms. Our findings suggest that VNP increases with increasing SR in large-sized organisms. In small-sized organisms, high rates of dispersal may mask a significant relationship between VNP and SR. By contrast, in large-sized organisms, lower rates of dispersal, interspecific interactions, habitat filters, and niches are more important for community organisation. We thus find the new concept as a promising way to aid in linking species richness and niches, but we stress the VNP-SR relationships call for further testing in other communities to see its merits for community ecology.

We investigated whether such alterations can be explained by differences in functional traits between native and invasive plants of the same functional group or by differences in functional group affiliation. We compared six invasive forbs in Europe with six native forbs and six native graminoids in leaf and whole-plant traits, plasticity in response to nutrient supply and interspecific competition, litter decomposition rate, effects on soil nutrient availability, and allelopathy. All traits were measured in a series of pot experiments, and leaf traits additionally in the field. Invasive forbs differed from native forbs for only a few traits; they had less leaf chlorophyll and lower phosphorus (P) uptake from soil, but they tended to have a stronger allelopathic effect. The invasive forbs differed in many traits from the native graminoids, their leaves had lower tissue densities and a shorter life span, their litter decomposed faster and they had a lower nitrogen-use efficiency. Our results suggest that invasive forbs have the potential to alter ecosystem properties when invading graminoid-dominated and displacing native graminoids but not when displacing native forbs.","[Scharfy, Deborah; Funk, Andrea; Venterink, Harry Olde; Guesewell, Sabine] ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Scharfy, D (corresponding author), Agroscope Reckenholz Taenikon Res Stn, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.",deborah.scharfy@env.ethz.ch,"olde Venterink, Harry/K-9547-2015","olde Venterink, Harry/0000-0002-8963-1153",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [2-77669-05],"We thank Rose Trachsler and Marilyn Gaschen for their help with nutrient analyses, Martin Fotsch for his help in maintaining the experiment, as well as Sophia Etzold, Myriam Poll and Daniel Schlaepfer for their help in plant processing and data collection.

Although many studies have examined the ecological effects of invasives, little is known about the physiological mechanisms that might contribute to invasive success. The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, a native of the Mediterranean Sea, is a successful invader on the central and southern coasts of California, where it has largely displaced the native congener, Mytilus trossulus. It has been previously shown that thermal responses of several physiological traits may underlie the capacity of M. galloprovincialis to out-compete M. trossulus in warm habitats. To elucidate possible differences in stress-induced gene expression between these congeners, we developed an oligonucleotide microarray with 8874 probes representing 4488 different genes that recognized mRNAs of both species. In acute heat-stress experiments, 1531 of these genes showed temperature-dependent changes in expression that were highly similar in the two congeners. By contrast, 96 genes showed species-specific responses to heat stress, functionally characterized by their involvement in oxidative stress, proteolysis, energy metabolism, ion transport, cell signaling and cytoskeletal reorganization. The gene that showed the biggest difference between the species was the gene for the molecular chaperone small heat shock protein 24, which was highly induced in M. galloprovincialis and showed only a small change in M. trossulus. These different responses to acute heat stress may help to explain - and predict - the invasive success of M. galloprovincialis in a warming world.","[Lockwood, Brent L.; Sanders, Jon G.; Somero, George N.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA","Lockwood, BL (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Oceanview Blvd, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA.",blockwoo@stanford.edu,"Sanders, Jon/W-7773-2019; Lockwood, Brent L./F-1389-2017; Sanders, Jon/A-3068-2012; Somero, George/AAC-3321-2019","Sanders, Jon/0000-0001-6077-4014; Lockwood, Brent L./0000-0003-4694-5897; Sanders, Jon/0000-0001-6077-4014; ",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-0718734]; Earl and Ethel Myers Marine Biological and Oceanographic Trust; David and Lucile Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation,"We thank Dr Lars Tomanek of California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, CA, USA, for collecting M. galloprovincialis and maintaining mussels in his laboratory.

Methods Species composition, stand density, tree size distribution, and aboveground production were investigated along three transects in a 50-year-old planted mangrove stand and three transects in an adjacent natural mangrove stand in Shenzhen Bay, South China. Measurements were made on tree distribution by species, stand structure, and aboveground biomass (AGB) distribution. Analyses were performed on the spatial patterns of tree size distribution and species association. Important Findings We found that the planted and natural mangrove stands did not differ in stand density, average diameter at breast height (DBH), species composition, and AGB. Spatial distribution of AGB and frequency at species level were also similar between the planted and natural stands. However, the traits in stand structure were more variable in the planted stand than in the natural stand, indicating higher spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the development and succession of planted mangroves. Geostatistical analyses show that both DBH and AGB were spatially auto-correlated within a specific range in the direction perpendicular to coastline. More than 60%, of the variance in these attributes was due to spatial autocorrelation. The Ripley's K-function analysis shows that the two dominant species, Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina, clumped in broader scales in the natural stand than in the planted stand and displayed significant interspecific competition across the whole transect. It is suggested that interspecific competition interacts with spatial autocorrelation as the underlying mechanism shaping the mangrove structure. This study demonstrates that at age 50, mangrove plantations can perform similarly in stand structure, spatial arrangement of selected stand characteristics and species associations to the natural mangrove forests.","[Sun, Osbert Jianxin] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Forest Sci, MOE Key Lab Silviculture & Conversat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Luo, Zhongkui; Sun, Osbert Jianxin] Beijing Forestry Univ, Inst Forestry & Climate Change Res, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Luo, Zhongkui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hualin] Neilingding Futian Natl Nat Reserve Guangdong, Shenzhen 518040, Peoples R China","Sun, OJ (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Forest Sci, MOE Key Lab Silviculture & Conversat, 35 Qinghua E Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",sunjianx@bjfu.edu.cn,"Luo, Zhongkui/D-1628-2011; Luo, Zhongkui/B-8125-2008","Luo, Zhongkui/0000-0003-0721-096X; Luo, Zhongkui/0000-0002-6744-6491; Sun, Osbert/0000-0002-8815-5984","Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-SW-132]; Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2008BADB0B0302]",Key Knowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KSCX2-SW-132); '11th Five-Year' Forestry Scientific and Technological Support Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2008BADB0B0302).,,61,28,29,1,61,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-9921,1752-993X,,J PLANT ECOL,J.

Despite the wide-spread use of amphibians as experimental model organisms, there is a limited understanding of how multiple abiotic and biotic factors affect the variation in metamorphic traits under natural conditions. The aim of our study was to quantify the effects of abiotic and biotic factors on spatial variation in the body size of tadpoles and size at metamorphosis of the European common toad (Bufo b. spinosus). Our study population was distributed over the riverbed (active tract) and the fringing riparian forest of a natural floodplain. The riverbed had warm ponds with variable hydroperiod and few predators, whereas the forest had ponds with the opposite characteristics. Spatial variation in body size at metamorphosis was governed by the interactive effects of abiotic and biotic factors. The particular form of the interaction between water temperature and intraspecific tadpole density suggests that abiotic factors laid the foundation for biotic factors: intraspecific density decreased growth only at high temperature. Predation and intraspecific density jointly reduced metamorphic size. Interspecific density had a negligible affect on body size at metamorphosis, suggesting weak inter-anuran interactions in the larval stage. Population density at metamorphosis was about one to two orders of magnitudes higher in the riverbed ponds than in the forest ponds, mainly because of lower tadpole mortality. Based on our results, we conclude that ponds in the riverbed appear to play a pivotal role for the population because tadpole growth and survival is best in this habitat.","[Indermaur, Lukas] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol EAWAG, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Indermaur, Lukas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Benedikt R.] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolut Biol & Umweltwissensch, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Benedikt R.] KARCH, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Tockner, Klement] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Tockner, Klement] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Schaub, Michael] Swiss Ornithol Inst, CH-6203 Sempach, Switzerland; [Schaub, Michael] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut Conservat Biol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Indermaur, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol EAWAG, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",lukas.indermaur@eawag.ch,"Schmidt, Benedikt R./B-8491-2008; Tockner, Klement/G-9265-2011","Schmidt, Benedikt R./0000-0002-4023-1001; Tockner, Klement/0000-0002-0038-8151",MAVA Foundation (Switzerland),"We are grateful to Simone Blaser, Pascal Meuwly and Ursina von Planta for field data collection.

The positive interspecific abundance-occupancy relationship (AOR) is a ubiquitous, but highly variable ecological pattern. Understanding this variation is a key challenge for community ecologists and little progress has been made using ecological trait data to predict variation in abundance and occupancy. 2. We used a data set from vascular plants in New Zealand South Island tussock grasslands measured at a landscape scale over 25 years to analyse AORs within a single habitat type. 3. We firstly modelled the interspecific relationship between abundance and occupancy across species. We then measured the deviations in the slopes of the abundance-occupancy relationship for individual species from this overall interspecific relationship and related these slope deviations to data on species' life-history and ecological traits. 4. Highly invasive species that increased their ranges and abundances during the 25-year study period had significantly steeper slopes in abundance-occupancy space than the interspecific relationship although species with increased dispersal ability did not. Those species that were clonal showed significantly shallower slopes suggesting that clonality causes species to respond more slowly in occupancy than abundance to changes in their environment. 5. Synthesis. These results show that considering the population dynamics of individual species allows us to relate species' traits to their trajectory over time in abundance-occupancy space and thus can lead to a better understanding of the variation and scatter around the interspecific abundance-occupancy pattern.","[Buckley, Hannah L.] Lincoln Univ, Dept Ecol, Canterbury 7647, New Zealand; [Freckleton, Robert P.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Buckley, HL (corresponding author), Lincoln Univ, Dept Ecol, POB 84, Canterbury 7647, New Zealand.",hannah.buckley@lincoln.ac.nz,"Freckleton, Rob P/B-6455-2013; Buckley, Hannah/U-4758-2017","Buckley, Hannah/0000-0002-4170-080X; Freckleton, Robert/0000-0002-8338-864X",Lincoln University Research Fund; Struthers/Mt Grand Trust; Land Information New Zealand; New Zealand Department of Conservation; Miss E.

Procellariiform seabirds provide particularly appropriate models for investigating these topics as they possess a well-developed olfactory system and unequalled associated capabilities. We present here results from a detailed chemical examination of the uropygial secretions (the main source of avian exogenous chemicals) from 2 petrel species, Antarctic prions and blue petrels. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques and recently developed multivariate tools, we demonstrate that the secretions contain critical socioecological information such as species, gender, and individual identity. Importantly, these chemosignals correlate with some of the birds' olfactory behaviors demonstrated in the field. The molecules found to be associated with social information were essentially large unsaturated compounds, suggesting that these may be precursors of, or correlates to the actual airborne signals. Although the species-specific chemosignal may be involved in interspecific competition at the breeding grounds, the role of the sexually specific chemosignal remains unclear. The existence of individually specific signals (i.e., chemical signatures) in these birds has important implications for processes such as individual recognition and genetically based mate choice already suspected for this group. Our results open promising avenues of research for the study of avian chemical communication.","[Mardon, Jerome; Couchoux, Charline; Bonadonna, Francesco] CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, Dept Populat Biol, Behav Ecol Grp, F-34293 Montpellier, France; [Mardon, Jerome; Saunders, Sandra M.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biomed Biomol & Chem Sci, Atmospher & Environm Chem Res AECR Grp, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Anderson, Marti J.] Massey Univ, Inst Informat & Math Sci, Auckland, New Zealand","Mardon, J (corresponding author), CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, Dept Populat Biol, Behav Ecol Grp, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France.",jerome.mardon@cefe.cnrs.fr,"Tuluc, Petronel/C-2527-2011; Anderson, Marti J./AAQ-9038-2021; Bonadonna, Francesco/A-7456-2008","Anderson, Marti J./0000-0002-4018-4049; Bonadonna, Francesco/0000-0002-2702-5801",Institut Polaire Francxais Paul-Emile Victor [354]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche FrancxaiseFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-08-BLAN-0117-01],This work was supported by the Institut Polaire Francxais Paul-Emile Victor through the program [ETHOTAAF 354 to F.B.]; and the Agence Nationale de la Recherche Francxaise [AMBO ANR-08-BLAN-0117-01 to F.B.].,,70,65,65,0,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0379-864X,1464-3553,,CHEM SENSES,Chem.

These herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) have been interpreted as being indirect defenses. However, given that no studies have yet investigated whether HIPVs benefit the fitness of a plant, their defensive function remains to be established. Moreover, herbivores, pathogens, pollinators and competitors also respond to HIPVs and, in addition, neighbouring plants in native populations also emit volatiles that provide a background odour. These considerations enrich the evolutionary context of HIPVs and complicate predictions about their adaptive value. Molecular advances in our understanding of HIPV signaling and biosynthesis is enabling the creation of HIPV-'mute' and possibly HIPV-'deaf' plants. As we discuss here, such plants could be used for unbiased examination of the fitness value of HIPV emissions under natural conditions.","[Dicke, Marcel] Wageningen Univ, Entomol Lab, NL-6700 EH Wageningen, Netherlands; [Baldwin, Ian T.] Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Mol Ecol, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Dicke, M (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Entomol Lab, POB 8031, NL-6700 EH Wageningen, Netherlands.",Marcel.Dicke@wur.nl,"Dicke, Marcel/B-2300-2010; Baldwin, Ian T/K-1809-2013","Dicke, Marcel/0000-0001-8565-8896; Baldwin, Ian/0000-0001-5371-2974",,,,107,694,737,19,481,ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",1360-1385,1878-4372,,TRENDS PLANT SCI,Trends Plant Sci.,MAR,2010,15,3,,,,,167,175,,10.1016/j.tplants.2009.12.002,,,9,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,581JX,WOS:000276519800007,20047849,,,,2021-09-21,

Fishes were captured by angling, surgically implanted with radio transmitters, and tracked actively from June through September. Most brook trout (96%) and landlocked salmon (72%) displayed long distance movements (>1 km) to open water bodies (28 June to 4 July) followed by periods of time spent in presumed thermal refugia (5 July to 16 September). Summer water temperature rose above 25 degrees C, near the reported lethal limits for these coldwater species. In contrast, the majority of smallmouth bass (68%), a warmwater species, did not make long distance movements from areas of initial capture, remaining in mainstem sections of the river (28 June to 16 September). Spatial overlap of smallmouth bass and brook trout in the summer is unlikely because brook trout presumably move to thermal refugia during this time. However, interspecific competition between brook trout and landlocked salmon may occur since they select similar habitats June through September.","[Jackson, Casey A.

This high diversity in soil ecosystems is however difficult to explain by classical Hutchinsonian niche theory, as there is little evidence for spatial or temporal separation between species. Using delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic ratios, we tested if resource partitioning along the humification gradient occurs; in neotropical soldierless termites of the Anoplotermes-group. Two distinct sites were investigated to check if interspecific differences are transposable between sites. Significant differences in delta N-15 were found between species of the Anoplotermes-group. Although some species displayed higher intersite delta N-15 variation than others, species-average delta N-15 values for both sites were highly correlated, showing that sympatric soldierless soil-feeding termites feed on distinct components of the soil. Our data also suggest that some species are more likely to shift along this gradient than others, in response to overall habitat conditions or to the presence of competitors. Feeding niche differentiation can therefore account for the high species richness and diversity of soldierless soil-feeding termites in neotropical rainforests. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Lottia gigantea were exposed to thermal stress regimes in the laboratory using protocols designed to mimic prolonged exposures in the field. The production of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) was measured as an indicator of sub-lethal stress, and mortality rates were measured. Peak expression of Hsp70 occurred during exposures at 32 degrees C, while the lethal limits of the limpets ranged between 30 and 42 degrees C, depending on the exposure regime. Lethal temperatures were approximately 5 degrees C lower in 50-60% relative humidity conditions compared to 100% relative humidity trials. Results from the physiology experiments were compared to field surveys of the upper limits of L. gigantea at HMS and with heat-budget model predictions of limpet body temperatures on a variety of substratum orientations. The highest frequency of sub-lethal and lethal stress events was predicted to occur on high-shore westerly and southerly slopes and horizontal surfaces, microhabitats where L. gigantea is comparatively rare at HMS. Predicted stress and mortality events were rare at low-shore sites, vertical surfaces, and sloping rock faces oriented towards the northeast and northwest. The combination of direct measurements of sub-lethal and lethal temperature thresholds using realistic stress exposures and predictions from a heat-budget model give insight into the role of thermal disturbance in affecting the local-scale distributions of intertidal organisms. These methods hold great promise for enhancing our understanding of the role of abiotic factors in limiting species distributions and making predictions about responses to future climatic conditions.","[Miller, Luke P.; Harley, Christopher D.

Two emerging hypotheses that account for coexistence in ant communities are the discovery-dominance tradeoff and the dominance-thermal tolerance tradeoff. Here we used behavioural assays and community-level sampling from ant assemblages in the southern Appalachians, USA to test for the discovery-dominance and dominance-thermal tolerance tradeoffs. Species that were behaviorally dominant during interspecific interactions tended to forage in a narrow window of generally warmer temperatures, whereas subordinate species tended to forage in a wide range of temperatures, including colder temperatures. Species that foraged at lower temperature tended to be behaviourally subordinate, suggesting that a dominance-thermal tolerance tradeoff promotes coexistence in this system. Species richness was positively related to site average annual temperature and within-site variation in ground temperature, suggesting that temperature also shapes the structure of ant communities and regulates diversity. There was no relationship between the ability of a species to discover food resources and its behavioural dominance, contrary to the predictions of the discovery-dominance tradeoff hypothesis. In sum, our results show that temperature plays numerous roles in promoting regional coexistence in this system.","[Lessard, J. -P.; Sanders, N.

We systematically investigated the genetic architecture of CPP using patterns of transmission ratio distortion (TRD) in F2 and backcross hybrids between closely related species of Mimulus (Phrymaceae) with divergent mating systems. We found that CPP in Mimulus hybrids was polygenic and was the majority source of interspecific TRD genome-wide, with at least eight genomic regions contributing to the transmission advantage of M. guttatus pollen grains on M. guttatus styles. In aggregate, these male-specific transmission ratio distorting loci (TRDLs) were more than sufficient to account for the 100% precedence of pure M. guttatus pollen over M. nasutus pollen in mixed pollinations of M. guttatus. All but one of these pollen TRDLs were style-dependent; that is, we observed pollen TRD in F-1 and/or M. guttatus styles, but not in M. nasutus styles. These findings suggest that species-specific differences in pollen tube performance accumulate gradually and may have been driven by coevolution between pollen and style in the predominantly outcrossing M. guttatus.","[Fishman, Lila; Tuthill, John C.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Aagaard, Jan] Univ Washington, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Fishman, L (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, HS104, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",lfishman@mso.umt.edu; jaagaard@gs.washington.edu; fred.lobster@gmail.com,,"Tuthill, John/0000-0002-5689-5806",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0316786],"We thank A.

It is comprised by substrate breeding and mouthbrooding species, most of which live in littoral habitats. Species communities are characterized by complex behavioral and trophic interactions, resulting in a dense pattern of partially overlapping territories, depending on the degree of ecological distinctness. We studied territorial behavior of breeding pairs in a substrate breeding species, with respect to territory size and defense behavior. The study species Variabilichromis moorii belongs to the tribe Lamprologini, the most species rich tribe of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika. Our study shows that breeding pairs of V. moorii can have highly complex territories, in which both parents hold separate sub-territories which are shifted slightly according to the movements of the fry, but the outer borders are conjointly defended. The size of the total defended territory varied from < 1 to almost 4 m(2), averaging at about 2 m(2) . Depending on presence of competitors or fry-predators evoking agonistic interactions, the territory size varied quite substantially over the day. Attack rates and size of the defended area decreased with water depth. Agonistic behavior was observed toward heterospecifics as well as conspecifics, with heterospecific attacks mostly concerning territorial neighbors and potential fry-predators in about equal frequencies.","[Sturmbauer, Christian; Hahn, Christoph; Koblmueller, Stephan; Postl, Lisbeth; Sefc, Kristina M.] Graz Univ, Dept Zool, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Sinyinza, Danny] Minist Agr Food & Fisheries, Fisheries Res Div, Dept Res & Specialist Serv, Mpulungu, Zambia","Sturmbauer, C (corresponding author), Graz Univ, Dept Zool, Univ Pl 2, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",Christian.sturmbauer@uni-graz.at,,"Sefc, Kristina/0000-0001-8108-8339; Koblmuller, Stephan/0000-0002-1024-3220",,,,45,15,15,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,DEC,2008,615,,,,,,49,56,,10.1007/s10750-008-9567-x,,,8,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,358IH,WOS:000259909900005,,,,,2021-09-21,

The speciation modelling approach gives smaller deviations between observed and predicted bryophyte contents of Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb than regressions based on total filtered metal concentrations. If all four metals, and Ni, are considered together, the WHAM predictions are superior at the 1% level. Optimised constants for bryophyte binding by the trace metals are similar to those for humic substances and simple carboxylate ligands.

Differences in craniodental anatomy follow a distinct taxonomic pattern that is paralleled by dietary niche differentiation recorded in species' stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen isotope (delta N-15) compositions, strongly supporting a hypothesis for functional divergence within the grazers. We propose that the evolutionary origin of grazers were multifold; at least two and up to four different types of grazing can be discerned within the 11 taxa studied here alone. However, correspondence between craniodental adaptations and isotopic differences across species are not found when only VC data are considered (i.e. morphological differences do not reflect varying proportions of C-3 browse to C-4 grass consumed). This implies that alternate anatomical adaptations to grazing are not related to differences between variable (part-time browsing) and obligate grazers, as previously predicted. Rather, anatomical differences correlate strongly with changes in delta N-15, which we infer to reflect functional responses to changes in diet quality associated with the degree of feeding selectivity and short-, medium-, or tall-grass grazing.

Such systems based on apple (Malus spp.), peach (Prunus spp.), and pear (Pyrus spp.) are common in northwest Guatemala as low intensity homegardens and are known to increase total farm productivity in communities where farm size is a limiting factor. This study investigated the potential for adoption of fruit-tree-based agroforestry by resource-limited farmers using ethnographic investigation and linear programming simulations of farm activities at the household level. Two communities with differing demographics, infrastructure, and access to regional markets were selected based on the presence of extensive fruit-tree-based agroforestry. The influences of family size, land holdings, and tree and crop yields on the optimal adoption levels of fruit trees were evaluated through a comparative study of the varying social and physical infrastructure present in the two communities. Fruit-tree-based agroforestry was potentially more attractive to relatively prosperous families or those with larger land holdings. Improvements in fruit-tree productivity and interspecies competition were of greater importance where family land holdings were smaller. The inability of families to produce sufficient food to meet annual needs, poor fruit quality, and lack of market infrastructure were identified as constraints that limit adoption. The complementarity of production with the dominant maize (Zea mays) crop, home consumption of fruit, and the potential to generate additional cash on limited land holdings were identified as factors promoting adoption of fruit-tree-based agroforestry.","[Bellow, J.

Potential trait diversity at local scales is also constrained by the regional species pool. Implications of such variation for spatio-temporal variability in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships are likely to be complex, but are poorly understood. In microcosm experiments conducted at laboratories in Sweden, Ireland and Romania, we investigated effects of species richness, evenness and density of stream-living detritivores on two related processes: detritivore leaf-processing efficiency (LPE) and growth. Assemblage composition varied among laboratories: one taxonomic order (Plecoptera) was studied in Sweden, whereas two orders, encompassing wider trait variation, were studied in Romania (Trichoptera and Plecoptera) and Ireland (Trichoptera and Isopoda). Relationships between density and both LPE and growth ranged from negative to positive across the study species, highlighting the potential for density-dependent variation in process rates to alter ecosystem functioning, but indicating that such effects depend on species identity. LPE varied with species diversity in the two more heterogeneous assemblages, but whereas LPE in the Romanian study was generally enhanced as richness increased, LPE in the Irish study increased only in less-even polycultures dominated by particular species. Transgressive overyielding was detected in the Irish experiment, indicating complementary resource use and/or facilitation (complementarity). These mechanisms could not be distinguished from the selection effect in the Romanian study. Growth was elevated in Romanian species mixtures, reflecting positive complementarity, but lower than expected growth in some Swedish mixtures was associated with negative complementarity, indicating interspecific interference competition. Our results emphasize the potential importance of detritivore diversity for stream ecosystem functioning, but both the effects of diversity on the studied processes, and the mechanisms underlying those effects, were specific to each assemblage and process. Such variability highlights challenges in generalizing impacts of diversity change for functional integrity in streams and other ecosystems in which the occurrence of important species traits fluctuates over relatively small spatio-temporal scales.","[McKie, B.

Does random colonization predominate in early stages of primary succession? 2. Do pioneer species facilitate the establishment of later arriving species? 3. Does an initially random distribution change to an aggregated pattern with ongoing succession? Location: Lignite mining region of Lower Lusatia, eastern Germany. Methods: Individual plants were mapped along a 2 m x 28 m transect during three successive years and classified into two groups ( 1) the pioneer Corynephorus canescens and ( 2) 'all other species'. Using the pair-correlation function, univariate point pattern analysis was carried out by applying a heterogeneous Poisson process as null model. Bivariate analysis and a toroidal shift null model were applied to test for independence between the spatial patterns of the two groups separately for each year, as well by exploring spatiotemporal patterns from different years. Results: In the first year Corynephorus and 'all other species' showed an aggregated pattern on a spatial scale > 40 cm and in the second and third years a significant attraction for distances between 4 and 12 cm, with an increasing radius in the third year. The analyses of interspecific spatiotemporal dynamics revealed a change from independence to attraction between distances of 4 cm and 16 cm when using Corynephorus as focal species. However, applying 'all other species' as focal points results in a significant attraction at distances up to 60 cm in the first year and a diminishing attraction in the second and third years with distances <= 6 cm. Conclusions: Facilitative species-species interactions are present in early stages of primary succession, resulting mainly from pioneer species acting as physical barriers and their ability to capture diaspores being drifted by secondary dispersal along the substrate surface. However, due to gradual establishment of perennial species and their ability of lateral extension by vegetative dispersal, facilitation may influence spatial pattern formation predominantly on short temporal and fine spatial scales.","[Felinks, Birgit] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Conservat Biol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Felinks, Birgit] Anhalt Univ Appl Sci, D-06406 Bernburg, Germany; [Wiegand, Thorsten] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany","Felinks, B (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Conservat Biol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",b.felinks@loel.hs-anhalt.de; thorsten.wiegand@ufz.de,"Wiegand, Thorsten/H-5877-2016; Wiegand, Thorsten/AAP-9709-2021","Wiegand, Thorsten/0000-0002-3721-2248; Wiegand, Thorsten/0000-0002-3721-2248",,,,77,22,22,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

The population dynamics of these three species of snail were studied for 20 years in two adjacent fields where they coexisted on a farm on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. The fields were used for pasture-cereal rotations. Surveys were conducted in autumn and spring each year, coinciding respectively with the start of the breeding season and peak abundance of snails ( mostly juveniles). Populations varied greatly in abundance between years and between species, but snails were generally most common in spring, in wet years, especially those with wet autumns and wet springs. Rainfall early in a particular year (i.e. at sowing of crops in autumn) can thus be used to predict the likelihood of heavy snail infestations later in spring (i.e. at harvest). In contrast, the abundance of adult snails in autumn was a poor predictor of the subsequent abundance of juvenile snails in spring, especially in crops. There were no significant correlations, at field scale, between the average abundance of the three species of snail in spring, in either pastures or crops. However, at a sampling scale of 0.25 m(2), there were consistent, negative relationships between the abundance of all three snail species. Such patterns may reflect either competitive interactions between snails or subtle differences in micro-habitat choice. Patterns in the abundance of snails (e.g. large numbers near field edges) were suggestive of occasional invasion from dense populations in adjacent fields.","CSIRO Entomol, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Baker, GH (corresponding author), CSIRO Entomol, POB 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",Geoff.Baker@csiro.au,"Baker, Geoff H/B-9200-2009",,Australian Grains Research and Development Corporation and Australian Wool InnovationGrains R&D Corp,"The research was funded by the Australian Grains Research and Development Corporation and Australian Wool Innovation (and their earlier equivalents).

The colony on Zinaritou had 43 nests and a high breeding success, with nearly one fledgling per pair and 37% of chicks surviving (as a percentage of eggs laid). Low levels of interspecific competition with Yellow-legged Gulls, habitat suitability, protection from human disturbance and nearby trawling fishing activity probably contributed to the success of this colony.","[Charalambidou, Iris] Cyprus Ecol Soc, CY-2433 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Gucel, Salih] Near E Univ, Inst Earth Ocean Atmosphere & Environm Sci, Nicosia, Cyprus","Charalambidou, I (corresponding author), Cyprus Ecol Soc, POB 27817, CY-2433 Nicosia, Cyprus.",iris.chara@cytanet.com.cy,"Bond, Alexander L/A-3786-2010",,,,,20,0,1,0,3,MAX KASPAREK VERLAG,HEIDELBERG,"MOENCHHOFSTR. 16, HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0939-7140,,,ZOOL MIDDLE EAST,Zool.

The minimum light required for survival, shade tolerance, is a crucial life-history trait that plays a major role in plant community dynamics. There is consensus on the suites of traits that influence shade tolerance, but debate over the relative importance of traits maximizing photosynthetic carbon gain in low light versus those minimizing losses. Shade tolerance is influenced by plant ontogeny and by numerous biotic and abiotic factors. Although phenotypic plasticity tends to be low in shade-tolerant species (e.g., scant elongation in low light), plasticity for certain traits, particularly for morphological features optimizing light capture, can be high. Understanding differential competitive potentials among co-occurring species mediated by shade tolerance is critical to predict ecosystem responses to global change drivers such as elevated CO2, climate change and the spread of invasive species.","[Valladares, Fernando] CSIC, CCMA, Inst Recursos Nat, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Valladares, Fernando] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol, Dept Biol & Geol, Mostoles 28933, Spain; [Niinemets, Uelo] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia","Valladares, F (corresponding author), CSIC, CCMA, Inst Recursos Nat, Plaza Murillo 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",valladares@ccma.csic.es,"Valladares, Fernando/K-9406-2014; Niinemets, Ulo/A-3816-2008","Valladares, Fernando/0000-0002-5374-4682; Niinemets, Ulo/0000-0002-3078-2192","Spanish Scientific Council (CSIC); Estonian Academy of Sciences; Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceSpanish Government [CGL2007-66066-C04-02/BOS]; Estonian Ministry of Education and ScienceMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [SF1090065s07]","Our thinks to Niels P.

The four species often nest near one another, which suggests that habitat partitioning may have developed to minimize past interspecific competition. Our objectives were to determine which specific characteristics of nesting habitat were partitioned among the species and to evaluate the relationship of these characteristics to nest survival. We monitored nests and sampled habitat variables at three spatial scales: nest substrate, nest site, and territory. A multivariate analysis of variance indicated a difference (P < 0.01) in the nest sites of all species and in each pairwise species contrast. An analysis of variance and Fisher's exact tests detected differences (P < 0.05) among species in 21 of 36 variables measured. Classification tree analysis correctly classified nests by species at a rate better than would be expected at random. Habitat partitioning among the four thrush species occurred at all three scales sampled, with the most important partitioning variables being nest height, distance-to-edge, sapling density, and elevation. Mayfield logistic regression found a positive relationship (P < 0.05) between decreasing nest height and American Robin nest survival. Overall, nest survival was similar among the four thrush species examined, and most of the variables that we measured were unrelated to survival.","W Virginia Univ, W Virginia Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; W Virginia Univ, W Virginia Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; W Virginia Univ, Dept Stat, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; Univ Tennessee, Dept Forestry Fisheries & Wildlife, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Dellinger, RL (corresponding author), W Virginia Univ, W Virginia Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",dellingers@gmail.com,"Liu, Yi-Chun/H-5463-2012; Seidel, George/AAE-2371-2019",,,,,55,13,14,1,30,AMER ORNITHOLOGISTS UNION,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0004-8038,,,AUK,AUK,OCT,2007,124,4,,,,,1425,1438,,10.1642/0004-8038(2007)124[1425:HPOFST]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ornithology,Zoology,238KI,WOS:000251446100025,,,,,2021-09-21,

Polygyny is predicted where males can economically defend multiple females or essential resources used by females. In contrast, monogamy is predicted where neither sex can monopolise multiple partners, either directly or through resource control, but where one mate is economically defendable. The mating system and reproductive behaviour of five species of coral reef goby were investigated and contrasted with population density and individual mobility. The two most abundant species (Asterropteryx semipunctatus and Istigobius goldmanni) were polygynous. In contrast, the less populous and more widely dispersed epibenthic species (Amblygobius bynoensis, Amblygobius phalaena and Valenciennea muralis) were pair forming and monogamous. All five species had low mobility, mostly remaining within metres (3 epibenthic species) or centimetres (2 cryptobenthic species) of a permanent shelter site. Interspecific differences in the mating system may have been shaped by differences in population density and the ability of reproductive individuals to economically defend breeding partners/sites. However, in a test of mating system plasticity, males of the three monogamous species did not mate polygynously when given the opportunity to do so in experimental manipulations of density and sex ratio. Mate guarding and complex spawning characteristics, which have likely co-evolved with the monogamous mating system, could contribute to mating system inflexibility by making polygynous mating unprofitable for individuals of the pair forming species, even when presented with current-day ecological conditions that usually favour polygyny.","Univ Otago, Dept Marine Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Sch Marine Biol & Aqualculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Hernaman, V (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Marine Sci, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.",vanessa.hernaman@gmail.com,"Munday, Philip L/F-5443-2011","Munday, Philip L/0000-0001-9725-2498",,,,45,23,23,1,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0722-4028,1432-0975,,CORAL REEFS,Coral Reefs,SEP,2007,26,3,,,,,585,595,,10.1007/s00338-007-0222-1,,,11,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,201LH,WOS:000248832400020,,,,,2021-09-21,

Within these locations, 17 broad-scale habitats and 14 fine-scale habitats were surveyed using visual transects. In terms of broad-scale habitat use, four species, Notoclinops segmentatus, Forsterygion lapillum, Forsterygion varium and Ruanoho whero showed a high similarity in distribution, irrespective of depth or habitat characteristics. The distributions of Bellapiscis lesleyae, Cryptichthys jojettae and Ruanoho decemdigitatus were relatively similar, being primarily confined to shallow habitats providing a high degree of shelter. Forsterygion flavonigrum, Forsterygion malcolmi and Notoclinops caerulepunctus were all predominantly found beyond 10 m, irrespective of habitat characteristics. Despite the majority of species using several distinct fine-scale habitats, a high degree of variation was apparent between species, with the majority of species showing extremely low overlap of fine-scale habitats used. Differences in fine-scale habitat use were not apparent when comparing the nesting sites of species. All nests were found in fine-scale habitats, presumably affording a high degree of shelter from predation and physical disturbance. Interspecific partitioning of spatial resources probably occurs by depth and microhabitat in this species assemblage in north-eastern New Zealand. (c) 2006.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that larger ejaculate volumes should be associated with a lower degree of polyandry across tettigoniid taxa, controlling for male body mass and phylogeny. Data on ejaculate mass, sperm number, nuptial gift mass and male mass were taken primarily from the literature. The degree of polyandry for 14 species of European bushcrickets was estimated by counting the number of spermatodoses within the spermathecae of field-caught females towards the end of their adult lifespans. Data for four further species were obtained from the literature. Data were analysed by using both species regression and independent contrasts to control for phylogeny. Multiple regression analysis revealed that, as predicted, there was a significant negative association between the degree of polyandry and ejaculate mass, relative to male body mass, across bushcricket taxa. Nuptial gift size and sperm number, however, did not contribute further to interspecific variation in the degree of polyandry. A positive relationship was found, across bushcricket taxa, between relative nuptial gift size and relative ejaculate mass, indicating that larger nuptial gifts allow the male to overcome female resistance to accepting large ejaculates. This appears to be the first comparative evidence that males can manipulate the lifetime degree of polyandry of their mates through the transfer of large ejaculates.","Univ Derby, Sch Sci, Biol Sci Res Grp, Derby DE22 1GB, England","Vahed, K (corresponding author), Univ Derby, Sch Sci, Biol Sci Res Grp, Kedleston Rd, Derby DE22 1GB, England.",k.vahed@derby.ac.uk,,,,,,75,56,59,0,17,ROYAL SOCIETY,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,,,P R SOC B,Proc.

This study examines the role of aggregation in maintaining tropical dung beetle diversity and the effects of deforestation on aggregation patterns and diversity loss. Using clusters of pitfall traps. dung beetle aggregation was quantified in natural kind disturbed habitat at nested temporal and spatial scales in central Peru. The results indicate that dung was colonized by a greater number of species. many of which were large, leading to a higher total beetle biomass in forest habitat than in deforested, farm habitat. Beetles were intraspecifically aggregated at each spatial scale examined. Habitat-type (forest/deforested) had no effect on the intensity of intra- or interspecific aggregation. Analyses of aggregation patterns revealed that dung beetle assemblages in forest habitat were generally saturated whereas in deforested habitat they were unsaturated. In general. interspecific aggregation was too weak relative to intraspecific aggregation to explain the high diversity of species in forest habitat. Other mechanisms, including resource partitioning are likely to play a greater role in maintaining the diversity of dung beetle assemblages in the region. These results also indicate that the loss of species from disturbed habitat has not been due to a breakdown in the aggregation mechanism.","Univ New Brunswick, Dept Biol, Populat Ecol Grp, Fredericton, NB E3B 6C2, Canada","Horgan, FG (corresponding author), TEAGASC, Oak Pk Res Ctr, Carlow, Carlow, Ireland.",fhorgan@oakpark.teagasc.ie,,"Horgan, Finbarr/0000-0003-3796-667X",,,,40,13,14,3,23,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4674,,,J TROP ECOL,J.

However there is increasing evidence that parasite-mediated effects could be significant: they shape host population dynamics, alter interspecific competition, influence energy flow and appear to be important drivers of biodiversity. Indeed they influence a range of ecosystem functions and have a major effect on the structure of some food webs. Here, we consider the bottom-up and top-down processes of how parasitism influences ecosystem functioning and show that there is evidence that parasites are important for biodiversity and production; thus, we consider a healthy system to be one that is rich in parasite species.","Penn State Univ, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, US Geol Survey, Western Ecol Res Ctr, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Hudson, PJ (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",pjh18@psu.edu,"Lafferty, Kevin D./B-3888-2009; Hudson, Peter/AAB-8080-2020","Hudson, Peter/0000-0003-0468-3403",,,,54,486,505,9,288,ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",0169-5347,1872-8383,,TRENDS ECOL EVOL,Trends Ecol.

We investigated the relationship between intraspecific and interspecific aggregation in 17 component communities (the flea assemblage of a host population) of fleas parasitic on small mammals and hypothesized that interspecific interactions should be reduced relative to intraspecific interactions, facilitating species coexistence. We predicted that the reduction of the level of interspecific aggregation in relation to the level of intraspecific aggregation would be positively correlated with total flea abundance and species richness of flea assemblages. We also expected that the higher degree of facilitation of flea coexistence would be affected by host parameters such as body mass, basal metabolic rate (BMR) and depth and complexity of burrows. Results of this study supported the aggregation model of coexistence and demonstrated that, in general, a) conspecific fleas were aggregated across their hosts; b) flea assemblages were not dominated by negative interspecific interactions; and c) the level of interspecific aggregation in flea assemblages was reduced in relation to the level of intraspecific aggregation. Intraspecific aggregation tended to be correlated positively to body mass, burrow complexity and mass-independent BMR of a host. Positive interspecific associations of fleas tended to occur more frequently in species-rich flea assemblages and/or in larger hosts possessing deep complex burrows. Intraspecific aggregation increased relative to interspecific aggregation when species richness of flea infracommunities (the flea assemblage of a host individual) and component communities increased. We conclude that the pattern of flea coexistence is related both to the structure of flea communities and affinities of host species.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Ramon Sci Ctr, IL-80600 Mizpe Ramon, Israel; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Dept Desert Ecol, IL-80600 Mizpe Ramon, Israel; Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Zool, SK-04001 Kosice, Slovakia; Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Wyler Dept Dryland Agr, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Ctr Biol & Management Populat, F-34988 Montferrier Sur Lez, France","Krasnov, BR (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Ramon Sci Ctr, POB 194, IL-80600 Mizpe Ramon, Israel.",krasnov@bgu.ac.il,"Krasnov, Boris R./F-2234-2012; Stanko, Michal/AAN-6099-2020; Khokhlova, Irina/F-2235-2012; HAWLENA, HADAS/F-1669-2012; Morand, Serge/M-5433-2018","Krasnov, Boris R./0000-0002-0382-3331; Stanko, Michal/0000-0002-9917-2421; Khokhlova, Irina/0000-0003-0169-7770; HAWLENA, HADAS/0000-0002-0634-2920; Morand, Serge/0000-0003-3986-7659",,,,79,29,30,0,16,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0906-7590,,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,APR,2006,29,2,,,,,159,168,,10.1111/j.2005.0906-7590.04353.x,,,10,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,032IB,WOS:000236767000003,,,,,2021-09-21,

The theory of ecological speciation predicts that natural selection shapes adaptive divergence. In this observational study, we examined the first phase of ecological speciation, namely adaptive divergence in foraging behaviour and morphology across populations ( island and mainland sites) of the sexually dimorphic Superb Fairy-wren ( Malurus cyaneus) that have been separated for approximately 9000 years. Current island theory predicts larger body-size in island species, as well as more generalist foraging and occupation of a wider ecological niche that is favoured by large body-size. We examined the vegetation structure across replicate study areas on Kangaroo Island and the mainland Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia and found significant differences in vegetation structure important for Superb Fairy-wrens ( percentage bare earth, shrub size and shrub abundance). Compared with mainland birds, island birds of both sexes: ( 1) occupied a wider niche breadth; ( 2) were significantly larger in body-size; and ( 3) varied less in morphology. Between the sexes: ( 1) there were few inter-sexual foraging differences; ( 2) males had a larger body-size and bill-length at both island and mainland locations; and ( 3) females had larger bill-width and bill-depth at both locations. These findings support the hypothesis of adaptive divergence in this species, with evidence that vegetation structure is important in their foraging behaviour and affects their morphology across locations ( niche breadth was potentially favoured by a different interspecific community). The lack of consistent sexual differences in foraging ecology suggests that the patterns of sexual dimorphism may be shaped by reproductive roles rather than vegetation structure in this species. The categorisation of the Kangaroo Island population as a separate subspecies ( M. c. ashbyi) is supported by these findings.","Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia","Kleindorfer, S (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia.",sonia.kleindorfer@flinders.edu.au,,"Kleindorfer, Sonia/0000-0001-5130-3122",,,,75,28,29,0,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AUSTRALIA,MELBOURNE,"LEVEL 2, 11 QUEENS RD, MELBOURNE, VIC 3004, AUSTRALIA",0158-4197,1448-5540,,EMU,Emu,,2006,106,4,,,,,309,319,,10.1071/MU06004,,,11,Ornithology,Zoology,105PC,WOS:000242043100007,,,,,2021-09-21,

Thus, a neutral model reflecting random colonization and extinction dynamics may be sufficient to predict assemblage patterns at the scale of local habitat patches. If water level fluctuations and associated patch dynamics are sufficiently predictable, however, community assembly on habitat patches also may be influenced by species-specific responses to habitat features and/or species interactions. We experimentally manipulated structural complexity and proximity to source habitat (which influences colonization rate) of simulated rocky patches in the littoral zone of a tropical lowland river and demonstrate significant effects of both factors on species density of fishes and macro-invertebrates. Interspecific variation in vagility significantly affected assemblage response to habitat complexity. In a second experiment, created habitat patches were sampled over time intervals ranging from 1 day to 36 days to examine temporal dynamics of community assembly. A null-model test revealed that assemblage structure became increasingly non-random, concomitant with increasing species density, over time. Community dynamics in newly formed habitat patches appeared to be dominated by dispersal, whereas in older patches, abundances of individual species increasingly were influenced by habitat characteristics. These data suggest that species-specific responses to environmental variation resulted, in part, because of species interactions. We conclude that community assembly in shallow habitats of this tropical lowland river is influenced by physical habitat characteristics, the spatial distribution of habitat patches, and species interactions as habitats are saturated with individuals.","Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Arrington, DA (corresponding author), Perry Inst Marine Sci, 100 N US Hwy 1, Jupiter, FL 33477 USA.",aarrington@perryinstitute.org,,"Winemiller, Kirk/0000-0003-0236-5129; Arrington, Donald/0000-0002-1138-2580",,,,59,88,91,1,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,2005,144,1,,,,,157,167,,10.1007/s00442-005-0014-7,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,944LM,WOS:000230430500017,15891857,,,,2021-09-21,

Such changes are observed as organisms invade new environments, and they are often triggered by changed interspecific interactions, such as differences in predation regimes. However, in spite of increased recognition of antagonistic male-female mating interactions, there is very limited evidence that such intraspecific interactions could cause rapid evolutionary dynamics in nature. This is because ecological and longitudinal data from natural populations have been lacking. Here we show that in a color-polymorphic damselfly species, male-female mating interactions lead to rapid evolutionary change in morph frequencies between generations. Field data and computer simulations indicate that these changes are driven by sexual conflict, in which morph fecundities are negatively affected by frequency- and density-dependent male mating harassment. These frequency- dependent processes prevent population divergence by maintaining a female polymorphism in most populations. Although these results contrast with the traditional view of how sexual conflict enhances the rate of population divergence, they are consistent with a recent theoretical model of how females may form discrete genetic clusters in response to male mating harassment.","Lund Univ, Sect Anim Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Svensson, EI (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Sect Anim Ecol, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",erik.svensson@zooekol.lu.se; jessica.abbott@zooekol.lu.se; roger.hardling@zooekol.lu.se,"Abbott, Jessica K/F-5848-2010; Svensson, Erik/E-8324-2010","Abbott, Jessica K/0000-0002-8743-2089; Svensson, Erik/0000-0001-9006-016X",,,,53,186,193,0,47,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

It is commonly assumed that good species are sufficiently isolated genetically that gene genealogies represent accurate phylogenies. However, it is increasingly clear that good species may continue to exchange genetic material through hybridization (introgression). Many studies of closely related species reveal introgression of some genes without others, often with more rapid introgression of maternally inherited chloroplast or mitochondrial DNA (cpDNA, mtDNA). We seek a general explanation for this biased introgression using simple models of common reproductive isolating barriers (RIBs). We compare empirically informed models of prezygotic isolation (for pre- and post-insemination mechanisms of both female choice and male competition) with postzygotic isolation and demonstrate that rate of introgression depends critically upon type of RIB and mode of genetic inheritance (maternal versus biparental versus paternal). Our frequency-dependent prezygotic RIBs allow much more rapid introgression of biparentally and maternally inherited genes than do commonly modeled postzygotic RIBs (especially maternally inherited DNA). After considering the specific predictions in the context of empirical observations, we conclude that our model of prezygotic RIBs is a general explanation for biased introgression of maternally inherited genomic components. These findings suggest that we should use extreme caution when interpreting single gene genealogies as species phylogenies, especially for cpDNA and mtDNA.","Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Chan, KMA (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Conservat Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",kaichan@stanford.edu,"Chan, Kai M A/C-1682-2009; Levin, Simon/J-1218-2014","Chan, Kai M A/0000-0002-7804-3276; Levin, Simon/0000-0002-8216-5639",,,,120,240,245,0,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,APR,2005,59,4,,,,,720,729,,,,,10,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,920ZP,WOS:000228734300002,15926684,,,,2021-09-21,

We investigated pollinator preferences and their efficacy as ethological isolation mechanisms between two interfertile species, Nicotiana alata and N. forgetiana and their F-1 hybrids. Hawkmoths pollinate N. alata, while primarily hummingbirds and occasionally small hawkmoths visit N. forgetiana. F-1 hybrids are easily produced in the greenhouse and although the species grow in similar habitats, hybrids have not been found in nature. In Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, near where both species are found, experimental plots were studied containing both species, and both species plus F-1 hybrids. In the mixed-species plots, hawkmoths showed a strong preference for N. alata. Hummingbirds were less common and only visited N. forgetiana. Hybrid seed was produced but plants made significantly fewer hybrid offspring than predicted by the frequency of interspecific pollinator movements. Nicotiana forgetiana was the seed parent of 97% of the F-1 offspring, suggesting an asymmetry in pollen delivery or postpollination processes. In plots containing F-1 hybrids plus both parental species, hawkmoths preferred N. alata and undervisited the other two phenotypes, except that in the third plot they visited hybrids in proportion to the hybrid frequency. Hummingbirds strongly preferred N. forgetiana in all plots but also visited F-1 hybrids in proportion to their frequency in the third plot. Overall, F-1 hybrids were well pollinated and were frequently visited immediately before or after one of the parental species. Thus hybrids could facilitate gene flow between the parental species. We conclude that pollinator discrimination among species is strong but is an imperfect isolation mechanism, especially if hybrids are present.","Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Ecol, Conservacao & Manejo Vida Silvestre, BR-30161970 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MT USA","Ippolito, A (corresponding author), De Paul Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 111 MacGowan Hall, Chicago, IL 60614 USA.",holtsfordt@missouri.edu,"Fernandes, Geraldo/AAN-5602-2021","Fernandes, Geraldo/0000-0003-1559-6049",,,,50,57,57,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,DEC,2004,58,12,,,,,2634,2644,,,,,11,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,885LE,WOS:000226157300004,15696743,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

Mosquitoes in the genus Culex are commonly described as foraging primarily by filtering the water column. This behavior contrasts with that of other container-dwelling genera, such as Aedes and Ochlerotatus, that are thought to forage primarily by browsing on container and detritus surfaces. We compared the feeding behavior of Cx. pipiens, Ae. albopictus, and Oc. triseriatus in a laboratory experiment in which we monitored behavior of individual mosquitoes in two different food environment treatments: food suspended in the water column only and food attached to leaf surfaces only. For each mosquito in each food environment, we quantified the time allocated by larvae to one of four positions and to one of three activities. The effect of treatment was significant, with individuals in Fluid Only environments spending more time resting-filtering at the surface, and individuals in Leaf Only environments spending more time browsing on walls. There were significant differences among species, with Cx. pipiens spending more time at the surface than the other species, which spent more time thrashing below the surface. There was no significant interaction of species and treatment, indicating that all three species modify their behavior in similar ways in these enviromnents. Contrary to current understanding, our data suggest that C-v. pipiens browse as frequently as do these potential competitors but show a greater concentration of foraging effort at the top of a container.","Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat Sect, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Yee, DA (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Behav Ecol Evolut & Systemat Sect, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553","NIAID NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01 AI044793-04, R01 AI044793, R01-AI44793] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI044793] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,41,56,56,0,20,SOC VECTOR ECOLOGY,SANTA ANA,"PO BOX 87, SANTA ANA, CA 92702 USA",1081-1710,,,J VECTOR ECOL,J.

Crustaceans and gastropods were selected as detritivores feeding on, and affecting degradation of, the litter of two monocotyledons and two dicotyledons. Despite interspecific similarities in consumption, detritivores exhibited species-specific effects on litter chemistry and on the activity of litter-colonizing microbiota. The chemical composition of feces depended upon both the litter type and the detritivores' species-specific digestive capabilities. Growth rates and survival of detritivores differed among fitter species.

Species distributions in communities affect ecosystem processes and environmental factors. These dynamics are determined by the properties (traits) of species in the community. The optimal temperatures for growth, the minimal amount of resource that sustains positive mass balance, and the amount of energy allocated to predator defenses are examples of such traits. Over time, the trait distributions in communities may change in response to environmental changes, which, in turn, changes the processes and consequently the structure of the system. The result of such processes is the focus of complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory. This paper gives an overview of how CAS theory can contribute to understanding the role of biodiversity on the ability of functional groups that make up the ecosystem to change their species compositions in response to changes in the environment. Any trait that requires investment of energy, mass, or time is subjected to a tradeoff for alternative use of this resource. Such interspecies tradeoff relationships can be used to make predictions about past environmental conditions, as well as the response of the properties of a group of species, e.g., total productivity and species distributions, to future changes in the environment. The trait-based framework presented here makes explicit predictions regarding the relation between the environment, trait distributions, and ecosystem processes. Trait variance, a measure of the width of the distribution of traits in the community, is proportional to the rate at which species within functional groups can replace each other in response to environmental changes. This adaptive capacity is crucial for the ecosystem's ability to maintain certain processes under times of change. Examples of empirical tradeoffs are given as well as how to formalize them to use in the CAS framework.","Stockholm Univ, Dept Syst Ecol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Norberg, J (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Syst Ecol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",Jon.Norberg@ecology.su.se,,"Norberg, Jon/0000-0003-1861-5030",,,,47,138,143,2,84,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0024-3590,1939-5590,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR,Limnol.

Developing parasitoids face a diversity of ecological constraints, and parasitism success involves decisions and responses made by immature parasitoids to find a host and solve conflicts with five potential antagonists: host, mother, siblings, competitors, and natural enemies. In this review we synthesize and interpret results from studies on (a) the convergent evolution of host selection behavior of first-instar larvae and females in hymenopteran, dipteran, and coleopteran families; (b) the competitive interactions between larval parasitoids and the evolution of gregariousness; (c) the susceptibility of parasitized hosts to predation; and (d) the ability of parasitoids to manipulate the behavior of the host. We discuss how ecological interactions between juvenile parasitoids and their hosts, competitors, and natural enemies influence the evolution of parasitoid life-history strategies, and why the integration of functional aspects of the ecology of immature parasitoids provides a reliable framework for effective host-parasitoid population models and formulation of biological control solutions.","Univ Laval, Dept Phytol, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; CRDH, Agr & Agroalimentaire Canada, St Jean, PQ J3B 3E6, Canada","Brodeur, J (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Phytol, Ste Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",jacques.brodeur@plg.ulaval.ca; boiving@em.agr.ca,,,,,,126,145,150,2,75,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0139 USA",0066-4170,1545-4487,,ANNU REV ENTOMOL,Annu.

A field study, spanning the 1990s, describes a rapid decline of the Fucus spp. stands along the wave-exposed Swedish southeast coast. During this period, a relative dominance of Fucus vesiculosus L. shifted to a relative dominance of Fucus serratus L. The decline of F. vesiculosus coincided with observations of large numbers of the grazing isopods Idotea baltica (Pallas) and Idotea granulosa Rathke, or with field observations of frequent grazing marks on Fucus fronds. I. baltica, but not I. granulosa, tended to aggregate in the declining Fucus spp. stands, indicating a strong preference for Fucus spp. In a mesocosm experiment I. baltica, when given a choice, grazed both Fucus species at weak water motion. At strong water motion grazing was concentrated on F. vesiculosus. It is hypothesized that one of the reasons I. baltica preferred F. vesiculosus to F. serratus at strong water motion may have been differences in habitat quality, like width of thallus, influencing the ability to cling to the plant. Smaller thallus, as in F. vesiculosus, thus is the preferred habitat for grazing of I. blatica. We postulate that the existence of F. serratus in the area may be favoured by strong wave action and moderate but not strong grazing by I. baltica, relaxing the interspecific competition from F. vesiculosus.","Kalmar Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden; Stockholm Univ, Dept Bot, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Engkvist, R (corresponding author), Kalmar Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, S-39182 Kalmar, Sweden.",roland.engkvist@hik.se,,,,,,48,21,21,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,,,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

An untested corollary of this prediction is that diversity within resource patches should decrease with increasing intraspecific aggregation. The recently derived species-aggregation relationship provides a general formulation of this prediction: as intraspecific aggregation increases within a geographic area., the species richness within samples of the area decreases. We tested this prediction by compiling and analyzing 76 data sets of arthropod species distribution and abundance. For each data set, we determined the mean amount of intra- and interspecific aggregation and three types of within-sample or local species diversity: species richness, evenness, and dominance. Using regression, we found a negative relationship between intraspecific aggregation and all three types of local diversity. Intraspecific aggregation explained a significant percentage of the variation in species diversity, typically between 20% and 60%. By comparison, interspecific aggregation usually explained <1% of the variation in species diversity. Our study provides empirical support for the species-aggregation relationship as a general macroecological pattern that emerges from intraspecific aggregation.","Miami Univ, Dept Zool, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","Veech, JA (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",,,,,,,31,27,28,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,DEC,2003,84,12,,,,,3376,3383,,10.1890/02-3127,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,762LN,WOS:000187973500027,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

However, the short-term benefits of priority access to resources have not always translated into long-term benefits in terms of growth and survival. In the present study, we test whether dominant Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) that were able to monopolize a food source in laboratory conditions had a growth advantage over subordinates in their natural stream. There was no relationship between initial size and rank, and high-ranking individuals showed no growth advantage over subordinates over a 2-month period when returned to the wild. A fish's growth rate in the wild was also unrelated to its sex or initial size, or the density of other salmon of the same age class within each experimental site. There was, however, spatial variability in growth, with salmon in one site gaining twice as much weight as did fish from the other sites. This suggests that at most of the sites, resources were limited in availability and that the absence of a relationship between growth and dominance rank was not owing simply to an excess of food being available. The lack of a positive correlation between social status and growth in the wild may be explained by several mechanisms, including the spatio-temporal variability in resources, interspecific interactions, fluctuations in habitat, or the presence of predators.","Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Fish Biol Grp, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; Fisheries Res Serv Freshwater Lab, Pitlochry PH16 5LB, Perthshire, Scotland; Cardiff Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3TL, S Glam, Wales","Harwood, AJ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, W Vancouver Lab, 4160 Marine Dr, W Vancouver, BC V7V 1N6, Canada.",andrewh@interchange.ubc.ca,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009; Griffiths, Sian/A-5240-2010; Brennan, Shea/A-9877-2010; Metcalfe, Neil B./C-5997-2009","Metcalfe, Neil B./0000-0002-1970-9349; Armstrong, John/0000-0003-2015-0500; Griffiths, Sian/0000-0001-6348-7352",,,,47,56,57,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

It has been proposed that larger hosts are preferred by that parasite because they provide higher reproductive success, but available data are quite variable. We studied the reproductive success of Shiny Cowbirds in nests of Brown-and-yellow Marshbirds (Pseudoleistes virescens), a larger and often multiply parasitized host. To estimate the extent of interspecific competition, we compared the hatching success of parasite eggs in nests with and without reduction of the clutch size of the host as a result of egg punctures inflicted by the parasite, and the survival and growth of parasite chicks reared with and without host chicks. To estimate the extent of intraspecific competition, we compared Shiny Cowbird egg losses, hatching success, and chick survival in singly versus multiply parasitized nests. Reproductive success of Shiny Cowbirds was 8% with depredation causing 80% of losses. Clutch reduction due to egg punctures were higher in multiply than in singly parasitized nests, but it did not improve hatching success of parasite eggs. Neither survival nor growth of parasite chicks was affected by the presence of host chicks. Shiny Cowbird hatching success and chick survival did not differ between singly and multiply parasitized nests. Parasite chicks were smaller than same-age Brown-and-yellow Marshbird chicks. However, because parasite chicks hatched one or two days before host chicks and had a higher growth rate, they were the larger chicks in the nest. Overall Shiny Cowbird reproductive success in Brown-and-yellow Marshbird nests was apparently higher than that reported in other smaller or similar-sized hosts. We think that host life-history traits like large clutch size, a longer incubation period, and slower growth rate of chicks are responsible for the high reproductive success of Shiny Cowbirds with Brown-and-yellow Marshbirds.

Evidence suggests that community assembly often leads to a single stable equilibrium, such that the conditions of the environment and interspecific interactions determine which species will exist there. In such cases, regions of local communities with similar environmental conditions should have similar community composition. Other evidence suggests that community assembly can lead to multiple stable equilibria. Thus, the resulting community depends on the assembly history, even when all species have access to the community. In these cases, a region of local communities with similar environmental conditions can be very dissimilar in their community composition. Both regional and local factors should determine the patterns by which communities assemble, and the resultant degree of similarity or dissimilarity among localities with similar environments. A single equilibrium in more likely to be realized in systems with small regional species pools, high rates of connectance, low productivity and high disturbance. Multiple stable equilibria are more likely in systems with large regional species pools, low rates of connectance, high productivity and low disturbance. I illustrate preliminary evidence for these predictions from an observational study of small pond communities, and show important effects on community similarity, as well as on local and regional species richness.","Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Chase, JM (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",jchase@biology2.wustl.edu,,"Chase, Jonathan/0000-0001-5580-4303",,,,74,619,642,9,343,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2003,136,4,,,,,489,498,,10.1007/s00442-003-1311-7,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,721MX,WOS:000185321100001,12836009,,,,2021-09-21,

Comparisons of shell utilization patterns among species and sexes were made with respect to physical damage (perforations and breakage in aperture and apex), encrustation by other organisms and shell size adequacy. Two adequacy indices were calculated. The visual adequacy index (VAI) was based on the degree of hermit crab retraction into the shells (1 = crab totally retracted and 6 = shield exposed). The shell adequacy index (SAI) was calculated through a comparison of the weight of the used versus the preferred shell. A relationship was found between VAI and SAI with crabs assigned as VAI = 3 occupying optimal shells (SAI = 1), i.e. crabs that could retract and those that could not retract the whole body into shells were in relatively heavier and lighter shells than the preferred ones, respectively. Shells utilized by the hermit crabs were generally undamaged and highly encrusted (except for C. antillensis ) by oysters, barnacles and green algae, features that may reduce the risks of desiccation and predation. The frequent damage to the shell apertures was associated with a high abundance of shell-crushing predators in the studied area. The degree of encrustation as well as the shell adequacy (VAI and SAI) showed intra- and interspecific variation, while the presence of damage differed only among sexes (reproductive classes). In general, the smallest individuals in the populations used relatively heavier shells. Fecundity of the crabs of this assemblage is thought not to be limited by shell use once ovigerous females are occupying optimal shells.","Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Zool, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Inst Biol, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil","Turra, A (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Dept Zool, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Inst Biol, CP 6109, BR-13083970 Campinas, SP, Brazil.",turra@unicamp.br,"Turra, Alexander/G-1352-2012","Turra, Alexander/0000-0003-2225-8371",,,,47,27,27,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-2933,,,J NAT HIST,J.

This pattern has largely been attributed to postcopulatory sexual selection involving interaction between the sexes. Such divergence has been suggested to lead rapidly to reproductive isolation among populations and thus to be an 'engine of speciation.' Here, we test two critical predictions of this hypothesis: (i) there is significant variation in reproductive traits among incipient species-, and (ii) divergence in interacting sex-specific traits exhibits a coevolutionary pattern among populations within a species, by examining geographical variation in Drosophila mojavensis, a species in the early stages of speciation. Significant among-population variation was identified in sperm length and female sperm-storage organ length, and a strong pattern of correlated evolution between these interacting traits was observed. In addition, crosses among populations revealed coevolution of male and female contributions to egg size. Support for these two important predictions confirms that coevolving internal characters that mediate successful reproduction may play an important part in speciation. The next step is to determine exactly what that role is.","Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Pitnick, S (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Dept Biol, 108 Coll Pl, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",sspitnic@syr.edu,,,,,,62,106,108,0,21,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Long-term data from Toohey Forest, subtropical Australia, show that noisy miner colonies intensively occupy a zone of 20 m from the forest edge, with frequent use occurring up to 100 m from the edge, but little beyond 200 m. Within noisy miner colonies, the abundance and species richness of other birds were both about half those recorded at nearby transects which were outside the colonies' main activity area. Bird species smaller than noisy miners, which are also those with similar diets, were collectively 20-25 times more abundant, and their species richness tenfold greater, outside miner colonies than within them, whereas larger species, which have less dietary overlap, did not differ. Exclusion of small insectivorous birds has been hypothesised to cause elevated insect herbivore density, but we found no difference between tree crown defoliation or dieback rates within versus outside miner colonies. Aggression by noisy miners can be viewed as a mechanism of interspecific competition, since miners have a relatively large body size for their diet and are hence able to exclude virtually all potential competitors at relatively little cost. We examine evidence indicating that reduced bird diversity in eucalypt forest fragments of eastern Australia is often simply the effect of noisy miner occupancy of edges, acting directly on the densities of other species through their aggressive behaviour. With an edge effect 200 m deep, a remnant 10 ha in size is likely to become entirely occupied by noisy miners, and this is a size threshold that has been commonly reported in association with area-standardised avian diversity reductions. Convergent patterns of species loss from small forest fragments in different continents are the result of different underlying ecological processes.","Griffith Univ, Fac Environm Sci, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia","Piper, SD (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Fac Environm Sci, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",,"Catterall, Carla P/K-7996-2017","Catterall, Carla P/0000-0002-1914-0455",,,,49,89,102,0,38,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2003,101,3,,,,,602,614,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12292.x,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,680PH,WOS:000182986200018,,,,,2021-09-21,

To investigate mortalities and spatial relationships of swift foxes (Vulpes velox) and coyotes (Canis latrans), we captured and radio-tracked both species at Rita Blanca National Grasslands in northwestern Texas. At least 89% of swift fox mortalities were caused by coyotes, resulting in a relatively low annual survival of 0.47 for swift foxes. Annual home ranges of swift foxes occurred near the periphery and outside coyote home ranges, and did not overlap or only slightly overlapped coyote core areas. Thirty-three of 36 known swift fox dens occurred outside coyote core areas. When swift foxes established dens within coyote core areas (n = 3), they were killed by coyotes shortly thereafter. Our data indicated that spatial displacement of swift foxes was not due to behavioral avoidance of coyotes but rather to increased killing of swift foxes within coyote core areas. Most mortalities caused by coyotes occurred in the immediate vicinity of swift fox dens, suggesting that coyotes made an active effort to kill swift foxes.","Texas Tech Univ, Dept Range Wildlife Fisheries Management, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; W Texas A&M Univ, USDA, Wildlife Serv, Canyon, TX 79016 USA; Texas Parks & Wildlife Dept, Pilot Point, TX 76258 USA","Ballard, WB (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Range Wildlife Fisheries Management, Box 42125, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",wballard@ttacs.ttu.edu,"Kamler, Jan F/F-8520-2011",,,,,43,30,30,3,12,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Most of what we consider to be community ecology is concerned with how individuals and species-specific populations respond to, smooth, or fail to accommodate, the consequences of inhabiting continuously variable environments. The essential principle is that individuals, populations, communities, systems, each build towards a definable, contemporaneous, habitat-specific supportive capacity, set by the resource base and the opportunities to process them. While both are amenable, interspecific competition is weak and many species may have the chance to raise their recruitment potential and build biomass, with the dynamic advantage going to the most efficient converters at every trophic level (r- vs. K-selection). As a result of the biomass expansion or of the independent diminution in opportunity or resource base, the special adaptations of disturbance-(R) or stress-(S) tolerant species allow them to glean survival under increasingly competitive strains. Persistent variability and renewal of growth opportunities make exclusion difficult and extinction is more a local than a regional consequence. Poorly competitive species survive through an ability to find new habitat patches 'released' by variability. Integration to larger geographical patterns gives the linkage to higher-order ecosystem behaviour. Some examples of contemporary ecological issues (latitude gradients, optimality, threshold behaviour and the maintenance of biodiversity) are reviewed in the context of systems behaviour.

However, soil resource availability may modify seedling responses to light and ultimately alter the course of succession. In the present study, we examined how seedlings in mixed conifer-broad-leaved forests in eastern North America differed in their growth and mortality responses to manipulated nitrogen availability. We then incorporated these responses into an individual-based model of forest dynamics (SORTIE) to assess potential longer-term consequences of seedling responses to nitrogen for temperate forest community dynamics. We grew seedlings of six study species, both individually and in mixed-species competitive stands, in a common garden for two years. The earlier successional broad-leaved species (yellow birch and red maple) consistently showed the greatest increases in biomass in response to nitrogen addition, while the most late successional of the broad-leaved species (sugar maple) and all the coniferous species did not grow significantly larger with increased nitrogen. We found a significant correlation between species' early growth rate and nitrogen growth enhancement. For those species that underwent significant nitrogen-induced shifts in growth and/or mortality, we adjusted their parameters in the seedling/sapling growth and mortality submodels of SORTIE (covering up to 10 cm dbh). Simulations revealed that nitrogen effects on both seedling growth in high light and seedling mortality in low light (data from parallel experiment) changed overall forest structure and dynamics. Increased nitrogen led to: (1) further dominance of young forests by earlier successional species (yellow birch in particular), through its impacts on seedling high-light growth, and (2) even greater persistence of later successional species (predominantly hemlock) in older forests, through its impacts on seedling low-light mortality. These findings were robust to an uncertainty analysis that incorporated experimentally derived error into the seedling/sapling submodels. In contrast, the identity of the species replaced by yellow birch and hemlock was more sensitive to uncertainty in parameter values. We conclude that seedling physiological and demographic responses to increased nitrogen availability have the potential to scale up and influence successional dynamics in mixed temperate forests, provided these effects persist throughout seedling and sapling life stages.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Kobe, RK (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",,"Kobe, Richard K/M-1054-2014",,,,,73,21,23,1,23,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Chub preferred conspecific shoals over heterospecific ones with olfactory cues being more important than visual ones for shoal choice. This preference was consistent with measurements of length:flank area ratios and length:weight ratios which suggest that both species are similar in appearance. When presented with mixed-species shoals, chub increased the percentage time spent with stimulus shoals with increasing proportions of conspecifics. Feeding experiments suggest that the preference for conspecific shoals is driven by interspecific competition (with minnows out-competing similar-sized chub) and the oddity effect. The importance of this work in the context of species assortment in free-ranging shoals is discussed.","Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Ward, AJW (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",,"Krause, Jens/C-2750-2011; Krause, Jens/J-4381-2013; Ward, Ashley/B-6227-2011","Krause, Jens/0000-0002-1289-2857; Ward, Ashley/0000-0003-0842-533X",,,,42,77,80,0,34,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Although matings between genetically distinct individuals may produce hybrid progeny of lower fitness than matings between genetically similar individuals, this is not always the case. Two species of North American leopard frogs (Rana blairi and R. sphenocephala) hybridize in central Missouri. To examine the relationship between genotypic fitness and the environment, I measured larval fitness components of the two leopard frog species and their interspecific hybrids using transplant experiments in field enclosures. This study was undertaken to compare larval fitness components of R. blairi, R. sphenocephala, and F-1 hybrids in three natural aquatic habitats representative of a natural environmental gradient (prairie, woodland, and river floodplain). Larvae were reared either in single-genotype stands or in mixtures of all three genotypes. There was no evidence of reduced F-1 hybrid larval performance in any environment. In fact. F-1 hybrids metamorphosed larger than R. sphenocephala, but not R. blairi, in the river floodplain habitat. All genotypes produced the highest proportion of individuals surviving and metamorphosing in the floodplain habitat. Thus, hybrid genotypes performed equivalently to or better than their parental species in three aquatic habitat types. Transplant experiments such as these are critical for directly measuring genotype-by-environment interactions and for assessing the role of ecological factors in determining the adaptive potential of natural hybridization.","Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Parris, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Memphis, Dept Biol, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",mparris@memphis.edu,,,,,,51,20,20,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2001,82,11,,,,,3001,3009,,10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[3001:HLPOLF]2.0.CO;2,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,491ZB,WOS:000172139500003,,,,,2021-09-21,

Of the 20 species occurring at Anakao (S.W. Madagascar), I I aggregated into clusters, including all but one of the species above the subtidal zone. The mean number of hermit crabs and species in clusters varied with several spatial parameters and time. Over 80% of the community clustered in certain habitats in particular tidal zones, whilst as low as 3% clustered in others. The highest intensity of clustering with shore zone was coincident with peak numbers of of hermit crabs. The initiation and duration of clusters of hermit crabs above the eulittoral was driven by circadian rhythms, whilst those in the eulittoral were governed by tidal state. Clusters above and below the eulittoral were longer in duration, and those in the subtidal were more temporally variable than those above it. Certain pairs of species showed positive correlations of occurrence and (more rarely) of abundance, and all the correlations (of occurrence) of one, Clibanarius eurysternus, were negative. Positive correlations of occurrence were related to the degree of shell-use commonality between species pairs. Eulittoral species clustered with other individuals of approximately similar size and exchanged shells upon cluster disintegration. There was evidence of a dehydration-reduction function to shell clustering in addition to shell-exchange facilitation. The highly variable species-specific strategies of clustering may be important in alleviating both intra- and interspecific competition in assemblages of similar and highly abundant species.","Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Zool & Anim Ecol, Cork, Ireland; British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; FRONTIER, London, England","Barnes, DKA (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Zool & Anim Ecol, Cork, Ireland.",DKAB@ucc.ie,,,,,,48,9,10,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

One species that has such heterospecific pursuits is the Eastern amberwing dragonfly (Perithemis tenera Say) (Anisoptera: Libellulidae). In this study, we tested five alternative hypotheses for the function of heterospecific pursuits in amberwings: competition for resources, prevention of interference while mating, predator deterrence, foraging, and mistaken identity. Resident males pursued both male and female conspecifics, as well as a species of horse fly (Tabanus spp.) and butterfly (Ancyloxypha numitor). Other intruding odonates including Epitheca princeps, Erythemis simplicicollis, Libellula luctuosa, Pachydiplax longipennis, and Plathemis lydia, were relatively, ignored. Because the horse fly and butterfly were similar to amberwings in body size, color, and flight height, and because they are not predators or prey of amberwings we concluded that the pursuit of these heterospecifics was due to mistaken identity. The characteristics of the horsefly and butterfly likely correspond to the cues that the male amberwings use to identify conspecifics, and the relative rarity of intrusions by these two species (as well as by female amberwings) probably made it more costly to discriminate and pursue only conspecifics than to make some mistaken pursuits.","Eastern Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Charleston, IL 61920 USA","Switzer, PV (corresponding author), Eastern Illinois Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Charleston, IL 61920 USA.",cfpvs@eiu.edu,,,,,,45,34,40,0,23,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0892-7553,1572-8889,,J INSECT BEHAV,J.

The method is developed as an in-depth study of blossom morphology in 37 populations of the Neotropical vine Dalechampia scandens. We test the hypothesis that among-population variation in blossom morphology is due largely to local adaptation to avoid competition from other species of Dalechampia that utilize the same restricted set of pollinators. Because direct phylogenetic and historical information are unavailable for these populations, we develop a novel comparative method for the study of adaptation to a spatially distributed selective factor in spatially correlated populations. In addition to providing spatially, or phylogenetically, corrected estimates of selective effects, the method assesses the local specificity of adaptations. We find evidence for moderately strong local specificity of adaptation among our populations, and furthermore we find that the effects of putative competitors are in accordance with predictions from a hypothesis of character displacement. However, sympatry or allopatry explains only 10%-20% of the interpopulation variation in blossom morphology, and we therefore cannot exclude the possibility that some other selective factors are major determinants of the variation.","Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Bot, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway","Hansen, TF (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Bot, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway.",Thomas.Hansen@bio.uio.no,"Armbruster, William Scott/B-4799-2013; Hansen, Thomas F/B-9021-2009","Armbruster, William Scott/0000-0001-8057-4116",,,,60,59,60,0,14,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Mark-recapture data were generated by banding birds captured during repeated flush-netting sessions conducted on a series of 7-ha plots over three consecutive winters. This resulted in 2,641 captures of 2.006 individual sparrows of the six species. Radio telemetry was conducted concurrently on 20 individuals of four of these species. Recapture data and radio telemetry indicated that Cassin's Sparrow (Aimophila cassinii) and Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) were the most sedentary, followed by Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii), Vesper Sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus), Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), and Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella breweri). Grasshopper, Baird's, Savannah, and Vesper sparrows tended to remain within fixed home ranges during winter. With the exception of Savannah Sparrows, whose movement behavior varied among study sites, movement patterns remained constant within species across pars and study sites despite radical fluctuations in the absolute and relative abundances of all species. Interspecific differences in movement pattern suggest that species in this system partition niche space according to the regional-coexistence mechanism. Abundances of the most sedentary species, Cassin's, Grasshopper, and Baird's sparrows, were poorly or negatively correlated with summer rainfall at the between-year landscape scale whereas abundances of the more mobile Savannah, Vesper, and Brewer's sparrows were strongly positively correlated. This is consistent with the theoretical prediction that movement constrains large-scale habitat selection, favoring mobile species in fragmented environments.","Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Gordon, CE (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",calebg@u.arizona.edu,,,,,,52,32,33,4,30,AMER ORNITHOLOGISTS UNION,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0004-8038,1938-4254,,AUK,AUK,JUL,2000,117,3,,,,,748,759,,10.1642/0004-8038(2000)117[0748:MPOWGS]2.0.CO;2,,,12,Ornithology,Zoology,339TC,WOS:000088493100018,,,,,2021-09-21,

Insight into the interspecific relationships of elk and mule deer requires a clear understanding of the patterns of resource selection and spatial separation between the 2 species on shared range. Accordingly, we monitored distributions of mule deer and elk during spring, 1993-96 at the U.S. Forest Service Starkey Experimental Forest and Range (Starkey), in northeast Oregon. We recorded animal movements with an automated telemetry system (ATS) that provided locations of each radiocollared animal about every 1-4 hr, 24 hr/day. We linked animal locations to a geographic information system (GIS) of physical, vegetation, and human-activity variables identified from the literature as being important predictors of distributions of elk or mule deer, and used logistic regression to identify which variables best predicted resource selection. We validated models of resource selection by comparing predicted and observed selection in 2 study areas with 5 data sets of animal locations collected during spring, 1993-96. Of the 8 variables significant for either deer or elk, 4 variables were significant for 1 but not the other species, and coefficients (3) for 3 other variables differed in sign between the 2 species, demonstrating strong spatial separation between elk and mule deer. The resource selection function (RSF) for elk was a stronger predictor of mule deer selection than was the mule deer RSF as a predictor of elk selection. Mule deer distribution was inversely related to elk resource selection, but elk distribution was not related to mule deer resource selection. In 4 vegetation types that dominate Starkey, mule deer electivity index [(used - availalility)/(used + availability)] declined as elk resource selection increased, while elk electivity index was independent of resource selection of mule deer. The dichotomy in resource selection between the 2 species, combined with the inverse relationship between mule deer locations and elk RSF, indicated that mule deer avoided areas used by elk. Removal experiments are needed under controlled conditions to explicitly test whether mule deer avoidance of elk results in decreased population or individual performance of deer.","Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, La Grande, OR 97850 USA; Western Ecosyst Technol, Cheyenne, WY 83001 USA; US Forest Serv, La Grande, OR 97850 USA","Johnson, BK (corresponding author), Oregon Dept Fish & Wildlife, 1401 Gekeler Lane, La Grande, OR 97850 USA.",,,,,,,64,86,89,0,72,WILDLIFE SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2197 USA",0022-541X,,,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

Overall, there was striking similarity in the sexual patterns of all the species; each exhibited simultaneous hermaphroditism with a high degree of variability in allocation to male tissue among individuals. Among the five species whose sexual patterns are described, at least three distinct sexual patterns were identified. Lythrypnus dalli has an allocation pattern distinct from the other species, with populations consisting of primarily pure females, strongly female-biased hermaphrodites and pure males. Lythrypnus nesiotes was also found to be distinct from the other species, consisting primarily of pure females and strongly female-biased hermaphrodites and male-biased individuals (mean allocation to male tissue = 75%). In contrast to L. dalli, L. nesiotes had no pure males. Indeed, no other species examined included pure males. L. phorellus, L. spilus and L. zebra had much more intermediate allocation patterns than either L. dalli or L. nesiotes. Most individuals were female biased (< 10% male tissue), and there were significant numbers of individuals with intermediate allocation (10-90% male). L. zebra differed somewhat from L. phorellus and L. spilus in that more strongly male-biased individuals were common in the sample (i.e., ranging in allocation from 90 to 98% male); this difference was not statistically compelling. This marked variation in allocation among closely related species suggests Lythrypnus is a useful model system to explore factors affecting allocation. For example, models developed for simultaneous hermaphrodites and appropriate for Lythrypnus predict that pure sexed individuals will be more common at higher density (e.g., because mating success is more certain). The observed interspecific variation supports this prediction - both L. dalli and L. nesiotes occur at high density and have the most extreme allocation patterns, whereas L. phorellus, L. spilus, and L. zebra occur at lower density and have more intermediate allocation patterns.","Univ Florida, Dept Zool, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","St Mary, CM (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Zool, 223 Bartram Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",,"St. Mary, Colette/A-5859-2008","St Mary, Colette/0000-0002-3175-5284",,,,56,25,25,0,15,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

These interactions are expected to be especially complex and diverse in the tropics, where both components display their greatest diversity. Variability in fungivory (apparent biomass consumed) of understorey basidiomycetes in a tropical cloud forest was investigated to test whether this could be explained (at the proximate level) by apparency-related characteristics of the aboveground structures (colour of pileus, stipe and hymenium; size and aggregation), as has been suggested for plant-herbivore relationships. Considerable interspecific variation in fungivory was detected (range 0-50%). Cluster analysis showed that neighbouring clusters had dissimilar levels of fungivory. Such clusters were similar in colour attributes of aboveground structures, but differed in aggregation size and apparent biomass. A quantitative analysis also showed that colour attributes were not strongly associated with the observed variation of consumption levels, whereas apparent biomass and aggregation size did correlate with the observed variation in fungivory. Furthermore, specific identity correlated with fungivory. It was concluded that coloration patterns may not be important for fungivory, whereas genet size and species identity (probably via characteristics unrelated to apparency, such as mycotoxins and nutritional value) seemed to be critical factors.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Guevara, R (corresponding author), Inst Ecol AC, Dept Biol Suelos, Km 2-5 Antigua Carretera & Coatepec,AP 63, Xalapa 91000, Veracruz, Mexico.",,"Guevara, Roger/F-3287-2010","Guevara, Roger/0000-0003-0768-3580",,,,57,14,15,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA",0266-4674,,,J TROP ECOL,J.

The common practice of quantifying CO2 responses as a single response ratio thus obscures two qualitatively distinct kinds of effects. The present experiment examines effects of elevated CO2 on both early and asymptotic growth parameters in eight C-3 herbaceous plant species (Abutilon theophrasti, Cassia obtusifolia, Plantago major, Rumex crispus, Taraxcum officinale, Dacrylis glomerata, Lolium multiflorum, and Panicum dichotomoflorum). Plants were grown for 118-172 d in a factorial design of CO2 (350 and 700 mu L/L) and plant density (individually grown vs. high-density monocultures) under edaphic conditions approximating those of coastal areas in Massachusetts. For Abutilon theophrasti, intraspecific patterns of plant response were also assessed using eight genotypes randomly sampled from a natural population and propagated as inbred lines. The species and genotypes examined generally showed enhanced early relative growth rates (RGR) under elevated CO2: however, such early growth responses did not necessarily correspond to increases in asymptotic size. As a result, interspecific and genetic correlations between early RGR enhancements and asymptotic size enhancements were weak. Effects of elevated CO2 also varied systematically among the size metrics examined. The maximum leaf area attained by individually grown plants was generally reduced under elevated CO2; however, most species showed positive effects of CO2 on vegetative mass at final harvest. Final biomass responses were greatest in species showing large enhancements in root growth. In addition, CO2 responses of plants grown in dense monocultures differed from plants grown individually, showing. Average reproductive responses to elevated CO2 were positive for individually grown plants, but negative for dense monocultures. It has previously been suggested that differences in species' growth rates may be the best single predictor of plant growth responses to CO2. Here we found that RGR (at ambient CO2) appeared to limit potential early growth responses among species, but that there was no such relationship between RGR and asymptotic size responses. We suggest that the latter may be determined in part by the degree to which large carbon sinks are formed late in plant ontogeny. The overall pattern of early and asymptotic growth responses to Elevated CO2 varied widely both among and within species, and we found little evidence for the existence of discrete functional types. We argue that both early and asymptotic responses are of fundamental interest from a modeling and a physiological perspective. Both types of growth response should be incorporated in all efforts to understand and predict responses of terrestrial vegetation to rising CO2 and other aspects of global change.","Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolut Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Thomas, SC (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolut Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"THOMAS, Sean C./B-6089-2008","THOMAS, Sean C./0000-0002-0686-2483; Jasienski, Michal/0000-0003-2224-6389",,,,76,28,29,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1999,80,5,,,,,1552,1567,,10.2307/176546,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,281XZ,WOS:000085187900007,,,,,2021-09-21,

Splendid fairy-wrens spent more time on the ground and in open areas, whereas variegated fairy-wrens generally preferred higher and more protected locations. The two species exhibited a similar pattern of separation with respect to foraging behaviour, as splendid fairy-wrens mainly foraged on the ground whereas variegated fairy-wrens preferred bushes. They also partitioned nesting habitat, with splendid fairy-wrens building nests in areas with a greater density of trees than variegated fairy-wrens. Further, splendid fairy-wrens built nests in larger shrubs and farther from the edge of these bushes than variegated fairy-wrens.

The authors review and analyse the impacts of the expansion of the yellow-legged gun on fauna and flora in the Mediterranean area. Despite the relatively limited number of both intensive and general studies, it clearly appears that the population explosion has had a very diverse and severe effect on the ecosystem as a whole (flora, vertebrates, interspecific competition, extinction-colonization processes). The most serious damage has occurred around the largest breeding colonies to the detriment of fragile, rare or very restricted plant and animal species. Thus. from the point of view of fauna and flora conservation, the yellow-legged gull can: for the moment, be considered to be locally superabundant. Control measures are often very onerous and necessitate heavy manpower and material resources. Additional extensive investigations will be necessary to assess the future development of yellow-legged gull populations and their impact on natural environments.","Fac Sci & Tech St Jerome, Inst Mediterraneen Ecol & Paleoecol, F-13397 Marseille 20, France","Vidal, E (corresponding author), Fac Sci & Tech St Jerome, Inst Mediterraneen Ecol & Paleoecol, Case 461, F-13397 Marseille 20, France.",,,,,,,68,100,107,0,16,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,,,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

The species responded differently to mixed-flocking. A change in feeding sites and/or techniques was found in six species, five of which increased their Feeding rates when foraging in heterospecific flocks. In mixed flocks, they tended to use similar substrates. That such interspecific convergence enhanced feeding rate might be explained by social learning, kleptoparasitism or a beating effect. Benefits gained through these effects were greatest in two species consistently acting as followers, Crested Drongo Dicrurus forficatus and Paradise Flycatcher Tersiphone mutata. Although as leaders, Newtonia Newtonia brunneicauda and Long-billed Greenbul Phyllastrephus madagascariensis often attracted other species, they also increased their Feeding rates through some mutualistic effects. Another leader, Rufous Vanga Shetba, rufa was the only species that neither changed foraging niche nor feeding efficiency in different social situations. Its participation in heterospecific associations probably resulted from other species exploiting the vanga's ability to detect predators. Therefore, the organization of multispecies flocks in Madagascar was mainly based on mutualism and commensalism which increased feeding efficiency.","Kansai Res Ctr, Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kyoto 612, Japan","Hino, T (corresponding author), Kansai Res Ctr, Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Kyoto 612, Japan.",,,,,,,34,61,69,1,17,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0908-8857,,,J AVIAN BIOL,J.

Prey taxa and size attributes were characterized for nine syntopic darter species; taxon, size, and availability of macroinvertebrate prey were also analyzed from Surber samples. In general, darters fed opportunistically on immature insects; few taxa were consumed in greater proportions than they were found in the environment. Some variation in diet composition was expressed, however, among different life stages and species. Juvenile darters consumed smaller prey and more chironomids than did adults. Etheostoma blennioides and E. zonale consumed the fewest taxa (2-3), whereas E. maculatum, E. variatum, and Percina evides had the most diverse diets (7-10 taxa). Etheostoma maculatum, E. flabellare, E. variatum, and P. evides consumed larger prey (1-13 mm in standard length), whereas E. blennioides, E. caeruleum, E. camurum, E. tippecanoe, and E. zonale rarely consumed prey longer than 6 mm. Percina evides fed on larger prey, fewer chironomids, and more fish eggs than Etheostoma species. Females consumed more prey than males and overlapped less in diet composition with males during the spawning season than afterwards. Fish diets did not seem related to habitat use. Greater trophic partitioning was observed in April, when prey resources were scarce, than in July, when prey were abundant. Darter species fed opportunistically when prey were dense, whereas they partitioned food resources mainly through the prey size dimension when prey were less abundant. The divergence of darter diets during a period of low food availability may be attributed to interspecific competition. Alternatively, the greater abundance of large prey in April may have facilitated better prey size selectivity, resulting in less overlap among darter species.","Penn State Univ, Sch Forest Resources, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; EA Engn Sci & Technol, Hunt Valley, MD 21031 USA","Gray, EV (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Res & Dev Lab, Rural Route 4,Box 63, Wellsboro, PA 16901 USA.",,"Stauffer, Jay/D-7318-2018","Stauffer, Jay/0000-0001-9653-942X",,,,47,31,33,0,19,AMER FISHERIES SOC,BETHESDA,"5410 GROSVENOR LANE SUITE 110, BETHESDA, MD 20814-2199 USA",0002-8487,,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

Age-intensity data for birds of known age suggest that the rate of parasite uptake increases during the first 6 mo of a bird's life and this increase reflects an increase in feeding rate with age and exhibits no signs of self-cure. Analysis of these age-intensity curves permits us to estimate the transmission rate of the free-living infective stages. Reinfection rates of adults treated to reduce parasite intensities were not significantly different from infection rates of naive immature grouse. Secondary infections continued to rise over a period of 18 mo and this suggests that there is no strong host-mediated response against the parasite. Any density-dependent reduction in parasite fecundity is probably very weak and would act through interspecific competition between parasites. Initial analysis of worm egg production in relation to the intensity of worm infection found weak evidence of density-dependent suppression of egg production at high worm intensities. However, a more rigorous analysis found that such a relationship suffered from Type I errors and was a consequence of the aggregated distribution of the parasites. Any density-dependent suppression of parasite egg production is too weak to be detected and would only occur at high worm intensities. The potential density-dependent reductions in fecundity on the population dynamics of T. tenuis and red grouse are examined using a mathematical model. The model suggests that the presence of density-dependent reductions in worm fecundity could produce significant reductions in the propensity of the grouse-nematode system to exhibit population cycles. The sustained cycles observed in the long-term dynamics of the grouse populations in the study area suggest that density-dependent reductions in worm fecundity and establishment are either absent or only operating at levels that are not detectable in field studies.","GAME CONSERVANCY, UPLAND RES GRP, NEWTONMORE PH20 1BE, INVERNESS, SCOTLAND",,,"Hudson, Peter/AAB-8080-2020","Hudson, Peter/0000-0003-0468-3403",,,,46,39,39,1,32,ALLEN PRESS INC,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0022-3395,1937-2345,,J PARASITOL,J.

This should be particularly apparent in obligate mutualisms, such as those that exist between yucca and yucca moths. Female moths collect pollen from yucca flowers, oviposit into floral ovaries, and then pollinate those flowers. Yucca moths, which are the sole pollinators of yuccas, impose a cost in the form ,of seed consumption by the moth larvae. Here we ask whether there also is a genetic cost through selfish moth behavior that may lead to high levels of self fertilization in the yuccas. Historically, it has been assumed that females leave a plant immediately after collecting pollen, but few data are available. Observations of a member of the Tegeticula yuccasella complex on Yucca filamentosa revealed that females remained on the plant and oviposited in 66% of all instances after observed pollen collections, and 51% of all moths were observed to pollinate the same plant as well. Manual cross and self pollinations showed equal development and retention of fruits. Subsequent trials to assess inbreeding depression by measuring seed weight, germination date, growth rate, and plant mass at 5 months revealed significant negative effects on seed weight and germination frequency in selfed progeny arrays. Cumulative inbreeding depression was 0.475, i.e., fitness of selfed seeds was expected to be less than half that of outcrossed seeds. Single and multilocus estimates of outcrossing rates based on allozyme analyses of open-pollinated progeny arrays did not differ from 1.0. The discrepancy between high levels of behavioral self-pollination by the moths and nearly complete outcrossing in mature seeds can be explained through selective foreign pollen use by the females, or, more likely, pollen competition or selective abortion of self-pollinated flowers during early stages of fruit development. Thus, whenever the proportion of pollinated flowers exceeds the proportion that can be matured to ripe fruit based on resource availability, the potential detrimental genetic effects imposed through geitonogamous pollinations can be avoided in the plants. Because self-pollinated flowers have a lower probability of retention, selection should act on female moths to move among plants whenever moth density is high enough to trigger abortion.","UNIV GEORGIA,DEPT GENET,ATHENS,GA 30602; UNIV GEORGIA,DEPT BOT,ATHENS,GA 30602; UNIV CINCINNATI,DEPT BIOL SCI,CINCINNATI,OH 45221","Pellmyr, O (corresponding author), VANDERBILT UNIV,DEPT BIOL,BOX 1812 STN B,NASHVILLE,TN 37235, USA.",,,,,,,39,25,26,2,18,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JAN,1997,109,2,,,,,273,278,,10.1007/s004420050083,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WE993,WOS:A1997WE99300012,28307179,,,,2021-09-21,

All trees 10 cm DBH and greater were measured and assessed For adventitious-root-climber presence. Additional trees of the 17 most abundant species were examined giving a total of 833 trees. Some 1694 adventitious-root climbing vines were recorded from the study area. Distribution over the rain forest trees was not homogeneous, bur exhibited host associations. Interspecific differences between potential host trees were analyzed in terms of allelopathy, bark characteristics, and gross morphological features. Bark characteristics are proposed.as the main factor for the relative absence of adventitious-root-climbing vines on trees of Syzgium papyraceum and Austromyrtus shepherdii. Thin, peeling, sloughable bark characterize these members of the Myrtaceae. Trees heavily infested by adventitious-root climbers include Beilschmiedia collina with non-descript (though slightly rough) bark providing a good, stable climbing surface with little phytotoxicity, and Citronella smythii, with thick, corky, fissured bark, also lacking allelopathic materials. Allelopathic effects of bark phytochemicals seem to be predominantly responsible for the absence of infestation of Alphitonia petriei by adventitious-root climbers.","UNIV ALABAMA,DEPT CHEM,HUNTSVILLE,AL 35899; JAMES COOK UNIV N QUEENSLAND,DEPT BOT & TROP AGR,COOPERAT RES CTR TROP ECOL & MANAGEMENT,TOWNSVILLE,QLD 4811,AUSTRALIA",,,,,,,,55,29,31,0,17,ASSN TROP BIOL,ST LOUIS,"MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN 2345 TOWER GROVE AVE, ST LOUIS, MO 63110",0006-3606,,,BIOTROPICA,Biotropica,SEP,1996,28,3,,,,,356,366,,10.2307/2389199,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,VJ915,WOS:A1996VJ91500007,,,,,2021-09-21,

Here, the biogeography of the most specious group of littoral Rotifera, Lecane, is discussed based on a recent revision of the group, and considering only verified records. Only 41.3% of all 167 Lecane morphospecies are widely distributed. Of these, 21 (12.6%) are cosmopolitan (sensu strictu), 26 (15.6%) are Tropicopolitan. There are 6 (3.6%) Arctic-temperate and Pantropical taxa. These categories of widely distributed taxa are not clear-cut, as differences in latitudinal distribution are largely gradual. Ten taxa have odd distributions. Most of these are insufficiently known and some may be recent introductions. All the major zoogeographical regions have their share of endemic taxa, with endemicity rates varying from 6.5% to 21.8%. Thirteen Holarctic, one widespread Eastern hemisphere, eleven Palaearctic, six Palaeotropical, one Australasian and five widespread Western hemisphere taxa have circumscribed ranges encompassing more than one region. The Palaeotropical and Holarctic components are particularly noteworthy, and may result from relatively recent faunal exchange between the Palaearctic and Nearctic, and between the African, Oriental and Australian regions. The different orientation of the major mountain chains of the Eastern and Western hemisphere, and the presence of extensive arid regions in Northern Africa, Arabia and Asia may explain the difference in faunal similarity between the tropical and temperate faunas of the Eastern and Western hemispheres. Omithochoric dispersal and human introductions may have played a role in the exchange of faunas. The analysis of pairs or groups of closely related taxa only rarely reveals a causal relation between tectonical events and phylogeny. Most vicariant distributions are readily explained by climatological rather than by tectonical considerations. The ranges of some closely related taxa indicate that they have different capacities of dispersal. When compared to pelagic Rotifera, littoral Lecane exhibit a relatively wide variety of distribution patterns, and relatively many have restricted distributions. This may be a consequence of, either or both, their lower abundance, or be related to the littoral habitat which, being less predictable, implies more specific adaptations. Lecane is tropic-centred, which may be a consequence of avoidance of competition and/or predation by 'Cladocera' and, eventually, Ostracoda. The most striking feature in rotifer chorology is the large range of many morphospecies. As such, the group's biogeography is more similar to that of freshwater algae than to that of other freshwater zooplankton. The likely explanations for this are the group's great ability for passive dispersal, combined with a short life-cycle and high fecundity, which are consequences of their parthenogenetic reproduction. So, relatively recent long-distance dispersal defines the ranges of the morphospecies. Vicariance plays a role in the distribution of Rotifera, but its importance is generally subordinate to that of dispersal. However, insufficient taxonomic resolution may be responsible for the apparently large ranges of some morphospecies.",,"Segers, H (corresponding author), STATE UNIV GHENT,DEPT MSE,LAB ANIM ECOL ZOOGEOG & NAT CONSERVAT,KL LEDEGANCKSTR 35,B-9000 GHENT,BELGIUM.",,"Segers, Hendrik/C-4101-2009","Segers, Hendrik/0000-0001-5399-3657",,,,139,77,90,0,7,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,MAY 3,1996,323,3,,,,,169,197,,10.1007/BF00007845,,,29,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,UT850,WOS:A1996UT85000002,,,,,2021-09-21,

(4) Because of the non-linearity of plant responses to CO2, studies of at least three instead of two CO2 concentrations are necessary to describe future trends adequately, (5) Edge effects, in particular unscreened side light, may lead to allometric anomalies, strongly constraining up-scaling to stand-scale CO2 responses, (6) Variables such as growth, yield, net primary production and C turnover are often confused with carbon pools, carbon sequestration or net ecosystem production, (7) Mono- and interspecific interactions between individuals may lead to completely unpredictable CO2 responses, (8) Experiments with seedlings benefit from the absence of prehistory effects but are likely to be irrelevant for the responses of larger trees which, on the other hand, may be constrained by carryover effects, Tree ring research indicates immediate sensitivity of large trees to environmental changes, supporting their usefulness in short-term CO2-enrichment experiments, (9) In predicting temperature responses, acclimation deserves more attention, (10) The significance of developmental responses is largely under-represented in experimental research, although these responses may overrule many of the other effects of atmospheric change, Results of more realistic experiments which account for these problems will provide a better basis for modelling the future of the biosphere.",,"KORNER, C (corresponding author), UNIV BASEL, INST BOT, SCHONBEINSTR 6, CH-4056 BASEL, SWITZERLAND.",,"Korner, Christian C/B-6592-2014",,,,,64,131,134,1,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0140-7791,1365-3040,,PLANT CELL ENVIRON,Plant Cell Environ.,OCT,1995,18,10,,,,,1101,1110,,10.1111/j.1365-3040.1995.tb00622.x,,,10,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,TA940,WOS:A1995TA94000003,,,,,2021-09-21,

Of the 102 fish species, 86 harboured at least 1 parasite species, and only in Antarctica and the deepsea were large proportions of fish species found to be free of ectoparasites. The mean prevalence of infection was 30.1%, the average of abundances was 6.7 parasites per fish, due to very heavy intensities of some parasite species (mean median abundance 4.31). Most parasite species exhibited a clustered distribution in the host populations, as measured by variance to mean ratios, i.e. some fish were more, and others less, heavily infected than if infection were random. Core and satellite species cannot be distinguished unambiguously, because numbers of parasites on almost all hosts are too small for any bimodality to become apparent. On average, the most dominant species represented 90% of all parasite individuals of a particular fish; different parasite species were often dominant on different fish individuals of a particular host species. Both abundances and maximum intensities of infection were positively correlated with prevalence of infection. Community richness varies greatly at and between localities, with the lowest richness found in Antarctic and deepsea fish and the highest richness in tropical fish. Species richness, abundance and prevalence of infection in many fish groups (with different ecological characteristics) are strongly correlated with temperature. If fish from all localities were pooled, pelagic fish had fewer intensities and (jointly with benthopelagic fishes) fewer species than benthic fish, and planktivorous fish had lower abundances and prevalences of infection than predatory and omnivorous fish. Prevalences of infection, abundance and parasite species richness were significantly correlated with host length. Fifteen positive and 1 negative associations among species were found. This and the generally low prevalences and abundances of infection indicate that competitive interactions are probably scarce. Overall, the findings indicate that most (if not all) metazoan ectoparasite communities of marine fish live in non-saturated, Little-ordered assemblages.",,"ROHDE, K (corresponding author), UNIV NEW ENGLAND, DEPT ZOOL, ARMIDALE, NSW 2351, AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,57,234,283,0,38,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7519,1879-0135,,INT J PARASITOL,Int.

These differences give rise to different shell forms in different habitats. In those species which have non-planktotrophic development, differences in shell form among shores have been usually explained in terms of natural selection because exposure to waves supposedly favours light shells with large apertures, while predation by crabs on sheltered shores favours elongated, thick shells with smaller apertures. Differences in shell shape among species found at different heights on the shore have been explained in terms of resistance to desiccation and temperature. Such variables would tend to act on a relatively broad-scale, i.e. causing differences among heights on a shore or among shores. Rates of growth, which might vary at much smaller scales within a shore, have also been shown to affect the shapes of many shells. In this study, the shape and relative weight of shells of three species of co-existing littorinids (Littorina unifasciata, Bembicium nanum and Nodilittorina pyramidalis) were measured. These species all have planktotrophic development and they are found on many shores where there is no evidence that they are preyed upon by crabs. Before explanations of shell shape are proposed, it is necessary that patterns of variation, within different parts of a shore and among different shores are clearly documented. These patterns were measured at a number of different spatial scales within and among replicate shores with different amounts of wave exposure. Large and small specimens were included to allow intraspecific comparisons among snails of different sizes found at different heights on the shore. The results showed significant differences among shores in shape and relative weight of shells, but these differences could not be explained by exposure to waves. In addition, snails of different sizes and different species did not show the same patterns although they were collected from the same sites. Importantly, the shell shape of Littorina unifasciata varied significantly among sites at approximately the same height within a shore. These differences could not be clearly correlated with density, mean size nor exposure to waves. The only consistent pattern was a decrease in relative aperture size in specimens living higher on the shore. Models that have commonly been proposed to explain shape and relative weight of shells in other species of gastropods are not adequate to explain the small- and large-scale variation of the measurements described here. It is proposed that any selective advantage of shell morphology and the effects of any variables on the development of shell morphology in these species can only be identified after appropriately designed and replicated field experiments.",,"CHAPMAN, MG (corresponding author), UNIV SYDNEY,INST MARINE ECOL,MARINE ECOL LABS A11,SYDNEY,NSW 2006,AUSTRALIA.",,"Chapman, Maura/B-2287-2008",,,,,70,35,35,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM,OXFORD,"WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP",0260-1230,,,J MOLLUS STUD,J.

Detailed observations of large, heterospecific feeding assemblages at fruiting trees revealed the existence of an interspecific dominance hierarchy, largely consistent with body and bill size. Social status influenced access to food in several ways. First, subordinate species were interrupted more and tended to have shorter foraging bouts than dominant species (n > 1,000 bouts). Second, analysis of over 7,000 video-taped head movements showed that subordinate species spent a smaller fraction of their foraging bouts actually feeding (as opposed to looking about) than did dominants. Third, when many birds were in a tree simultaneously, the foraging bouts of subordinate species were shortened; this effect was less pronounced or absent for species higher in the dominance hierarchy. Fourth, subordinate species foraged less frequently in mixed-species assemblages than did dominant species. Finally, subordinate species fed disproportionately more in the late afternoon at fruiting trees. The influence of social status appeared to manifest itself at the community level. The species composition of foraging assemblages was compared at isolated fruiting trees situated in an agricultural landscape near to (< 0.5 km) and far from (> 6 km) a large tract of primary forest. Whereas the full complement of avian frugivores foraged at the near trees, visitors to the far trees were predominantly of high social status. We discuss reasons why high social status and associated traits might confer an advantage in exploiting human-dominated habitat.","STANFORD UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, STANFORD, CA 94305 USA","DAILY, GC (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF BERKELEY, ENERGY & RESOURCES GRP, BERKELEY, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,73,25,25,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,NOV,1994,100,1-2,,,,,153,165,,10.1007/BF00317142,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PR645,WOS:A1994PR64500019,28307039,,,,2021-09-21,

Museum specimens collected from Ontario over a 95-yr period were used to compare the sizes of males and females collected in fall and spring. In a separate field study, body sizes of returning and nonreturning male and female red-winged blackbirds were compared over a 6-yr period. Overall, there was no evidence of higher overwinter mortality among larger males. Among adult (ASY) males, large individuals appeared to have higher survival than small individuals, although among subadult (SY) males, large size may have been disadvantageous. Weak evidence of stabilizing selection on female body size was found. Among adults, sexual size dimorphism seemed more pronounced after winter than before winter. Our results do not support the hypothesis that body size in male red-winged blackbirds is limited by selective mortality outside the breeding season. It is possible that size selection occurs earlier in life, when males are still in the nest. Our results suggest that caution should be exercised when interpreting interspecific evidence showing higher adult male than female mortality in sexually dimorphic species. Such patterns could arise as a cost to males of sexual selection and yet provide no insight into how natural selection opposes sexual selection for increased male size.","PRAIRIE & NO WILDLIFE RES CTR, CANADIAN WILDLIFE SERV, SASKATOON, SK S7N 0X4, CANADA","WEATHERHEAD, PJ (corresponding author), CARLETON UNIV, DEPT BIOL, OTTAWA, ON K1S 5B6, CANADA.",,,,,,,47,24,24,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,AUG,1994,48,4,,,,,1071,1079,,10.2307/2410367,,,9,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,QE323,WOS:A1994QE32300011,28564476,,,,2021-09-21,

Despite interspecific differences, the two species overlapped greatly in microhabitat use. The data indicate that at Linhares the two lizard species differed more in food resources than in microhabitat, and that most of the food differences reflect the foraging patterns of the species.","UNIV ESTADUAL CAMPINAS,IST BIOL,DEPT ZOOL,CP 6109,BR-13081 CAMPINAS,SP,BRAZIL","BERGALLO, HG (corresponding author), UNIV ESTADO RIO DE JANEIRO,INST BIOL,DEPT ECOL,RUA SAO FRANCISCO XAVIER 524,BR-20550 RIO JANEIRO,BRAZIL.",,"Bergallo, Helena Godoy/F-9257-2011; Rocha, Carlos Frederico D/A-6225-2013","Bergallo, Helena Godoy/0000-0001-9771-965X; Rocha, Carlos Frederico D/0000-0003-3000-1242",,,,26,51,61,0,20,BLACKWELL SCIENCE,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0307-692X,,,AUST J ECOL,Aust.

Mammals, birds, fruits and insects were the main four dietary components in both populations. In Minorca all four were important during the year, whereas small mammals and fleshy fruits were dominant in the Cantabrian diet. The insular pine martens were characterized by having a wide food niche breadth and exploited all foods nearly equally compared to the Cantabrian martens and those from two other mainland populations. Pine marten prey size index and mean prey size also were greater in Minorca. Insular gigantism in Minorcan pine martens may be attributed to increased food abundance and reduced interspecific competition.","UNIV TENNESSEE,DEPT FORESTRY WILDLIFE & FISHERIES,KNOXVILLE,TN 37996",,,,,,,,64,32,34,0,11,GUSTAV FISCHER VERLAG,JENA,"VILLENGANG 2, D-07745 JENA, GERMANY",0044-3468,,,Z SAUGETIERKD,Z.

In contrast to other oceanic islands, Madagascar is large enough to house most major components of tropical ecosystems, allowing tests of evolutionary hypotheses on the level of complete communities. Taking lemurs, the primates of Madagascar, as an example, evolutionary hypotheses correctly predict the organization of their community structure with respect to ecological correlates. Lemur social systems and their morphological correlates, on the other hand, deviate largely from the typical mammalian pattern. Thus, the traditional hypotheses of behavioral ecology, based solely on resource distribution and predation pressure, are insufficient to explain the existing variability in lemur social systems. Other factors, such as activity patterns and avoidance of infanticide, may be equally important. Due to interspecific variation in these characters, lemurs offer the unique opportunity to determine the relative importance of these factors for the evolution of social systems.","UNIV TUBINGEN,VERHALTENSPHYSIOL ABT,W-7400 TUBINGEN 1,GERMANY; DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27706",,,"Kappeler, Peter/B-6825-2012; Ganzhorn, Joerg/AAO-6955-2020","Ganzhorn, Joerg/0000-0003-1395-9758",,,,101,6,6,0,19,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0028-1042,,,NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN,Naturwissenschaften,MAY,1993,80,5,,,,,195,208,,10.1007/BF01175733,,,14,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,LC126,WOS:A1993LC12600001,8510760,,,,2021-09-21,

An attempt was made to determine whether these factors affected the distribution of these cottids, testing the following hypotheses: (1) Species do not differe in selection of depth, substrate, or cover type; (2) Species do not differ in the way in which they use refugia or in locomotory activity. When given a choice of deep (xBAR = 43 cm) or shallow (xBAR = 20 cm) water, the species differed in the percentage of individuals using deep water and were ranked rough sculpin (greatest use of deep water) > marbled sculpin > Pit sculpin. When offered a choice of sand or cobble substrate, all species chose cobble substrate more often than sand substrate; however, use of sand increased from marbled sculpin to rough sculpin to Pit sculpin. When given the choice of cobbles or plants as cover, the species did not exhibit a preference. Marbled sculpin used refugia most often, and there was a significant positive correlation between size of marbled sculpin and use of refugia. Pit sculpin were more active than marbled and rough sculpin. The results for depth selection were consistent with field studies, but those for substrate and cover were not. The difference in habitat choice and behavior among the species could not explain their field distribution. Differences in behavior among the species may result in differential vulnerability to predators in different habitat types. This may explain the absence of Pit sculpin from areas dominated by the other species.",,"BROWN, LR (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT WILDLIFE & FISHERIES BIOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,,,,,,31,24,25,0,9,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS HERPETOLOGISTS BUSINESS OFFICE,CARBONDALE,"SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIV, DEPT ZOOLOGY, CARBONDALE, IL 62901-6501",0045-8511,,,COPEIA,Copeia,AUG 1,1991,,3,,,,,810,819,,10.2307/1446408,,,10,Zoology,Zoology,FZ812,WOS:A1991FZ81200024,,,,,2021-09-21,

We proposed in a previous study that branching corals like Acropora valida were more susceptible to low temperature stress during, and weakened corals became more vulnerable to corallivorous attack by the snails Drupella spp. In the following spring. Acropora spp., however, are not the most common species found in Hong Kong. In the present study, we examined comparable temperature effects, both low and elevated, on Platygyra acuta, one of the most dominant coral species in Hong Kong. Platygyra acuta fragments were exposed to six temperature levels ranging from 14 degrees C to 32 degrees C for 7 days before they were exposed to prey-choice experiments with Drupella. Results from these experiments indicated that P. acuta fragments were generally tolerant to temperature changes within the range tested. In contrast to those observed for A. valida, they were not found to be attractive to the subsequent Drupella corallivory. The greater tolerance of P. acuta to both these environmental and biological stresses may have contributed to its dominance in Hong Kong coral communities.","[Tsang, Ryan Ho Leung; Ang, Put, Jr.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Marine Sci Lab, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Ang, P (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Marine Sci Lab, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",thlryan.411@gmail.com; aput96229@gmail.com,"Ang, Put/AAO-5490-2021",,Research Grant Council of Hong Kong General Research Fund [14122215],"This study was partly supported by the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong General Research Fund No. 14122215, we thank HL Leung, YE Leung, TY Ng and KT Wong for their assistance in the experiments.

We used capture-mark-recapture to evaluate species distribution, abundance, survival and personality, while Giving-up Density was used to test their foraging behaviour and the cost associated to it. All tests were carried out on the forest edge and at 50 and 100 m from the edge along three parallel transects 90 m long. We detected two species in both areas: Apodemus sylvaticus and Myodes glareolus. We found a neutral effect of the edge on species number, survival and on individual's personality (activity/exploration tendency). Bank voles occurred more along the edge and both taxa took more seeds from trays along the edge. The hypothesis of edge avoidance was not confirmed in any of the variables examined.

So far most studies have focused on antiparasite defenses operating at the egg and chick stages and neglected defenses that may work prior to parasite egg deposition. Here, we experimentally explore the possibility that hosts, as part of a front-line defense, might minimize parasitism costs through informed nest site choice based on perceived risk of cuckoo parasitism. We conducted a large-scale manipulation of visual and auditory cues potentially informing on the risk of great spotted cuckoo Clamator glandarius parasitism during the nest site choice period of the magpie Pica pica host to investigate its effect on host's nest settlement and individual year to year site fidelity. Early breeding magpies preferentially placed their nests in safe areas (i.e., in sites of low perceived risk of parasitism), and, this effect diluted with time elapsed since risk of parasitism was manipulated. Site fidelity of individual magpies decreased with risk of cuckoo parasitism, for those that were not parasitized in the previous year. Our results constitute the first strong evidence showing that hosts can minimize the costs of cuckoo parasitism through informed nest-site choice, calling for future consideration of defenses potentially operating prior to parasite egg deposition to achieve a better understanding of cuckoo-host coevolution.","[Exposito-Granados, Monica; Parejo, Deseada; Aviles, Jesus M.] CSIC, EEZA, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Ctra Sacramento S-N, E-04120 Almeria, Spain; [Gabriel Martinez, Juan; Precioso, Marta; Molina-Morales, Mercedes] Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Avda Fuente Nueva S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Parejo, Deseada] Univ Extremadura, Dept Zool, Avda Elvas, E-06006 Badajoz, Spain","Exposito-Granados, M (corresponding author), CSIC, EEZA, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Ctra Sacramento S-N, E-04120 Almeria, Spain.",moexposit@eeza.csic.es,"Parejo, Deseada/L-3953-2014; Aviles, Jesus/K-3332-2014; Molina-Morales, Mercedes/I-8397-2019; Martinez, Juan Gabriel/L-9471-2014; Exposito-Granados, Monica/K-1863-2019","Parejo, Deseada/0000-0002-7368-2378; Aviles, Jesus/0000-0002-1463-8393; Martinez, Juan Gabriel/0000-0001-5277-4620; Exposito-Granados, Monica/0000-0002-7996-2469; Molina Morales, Mercedes/0000-0001-8669-6624; Precioso, Marta/0000-0002-2030-5966","Spanish Ministry of Education and Science/FEDERSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2011-27561/BOS, CGL2014-56769-P]; Government of Extremadura [TA13002]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2012-051898]",This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science/FEDER (Projects CGL2011-27561/BOS and CGL2014-56769-P to D.P. and J.M.A.).

This is due in part to a tradition in ecotoxicology of considering the direct effects of toxicants on a limited number of model test species. However, the indirect effects of toxicity may be a significant factor influencing the manner in which ecosystem structure and function respond to anthropogenic stressors. Subsequently, failure to incorporate indirect effects into risk assessment paradigms may be a significant source of uncertainty in risk estimates. The current paper addresses the importance of indirect effects in an ecotoxicological context. Laboratory, mesocosm, and whole ecosystem research into indirect effects is reviewed. The implications of indirect effects for ecological risk assessment and potential areas of profitable future research are also discussed.","Pew Ctr Global Climate Change, Arlington, VA 22201 USA","Preston, BL (corresponding author), Pew Ctr Global Climate Change, 2101 Wilson Blvd,Suite 550, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",prestonb@pewclimate.org,"Preston, Benjamin L/B-9001-2012","Preston, Benjamin L/0000-0002-7966-2386",,,,115,79,84,1,45,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0364-152X,1432-1009,,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

We investigated why surf-zone fishes, which are introduced to the island ponds during periodic wash-over events, are unable to persist for extended periods. We simulated over-wash events by collecting fishes from the shallow surf-zone and introducing them into 0.56 m(2) field enclosures. During summer months. surf-zone fishes typically died within 24 h. Levels of dissolved oxygen and temperature frequently exceeded the tolerance limits of the surf-zone fishes (demonstrated in a series of laboratory experiments), suggesting that these variables were responsible for fish mortality. In non-summer months, when dissolved oxygen and temperature stresses were ameliorated, surf-zone fishes could survive for months in the ponds. We conducted field-enclosure experiments at 3 fish densities in order to evaluate the survival and condition of a common surf-zone fish, Membras martinica (the rough silverside): (1) 8 M. martinica (14 fish m(-2)), (2) 16 M, martinica (28 fish m(-2)), and (3) 8 M. martinica + 8 Fundulus heteroclitus (28 fish m(-2)). After approximately 1 mo during the spring, fall and winter, survival and condition of fishes in Treatments 2 and 3 were significantly reduced, suggesting that biological interactions were an important cause of surf-zone fish mortality. A temporal environmental stress gradient may result in seasonally varying importance of abiotic and biotic structuring factors.","Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA","Layman, CA (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, 210 Nagle Hall, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",cal1634@unix.tamu.edu,,,,,,103,24,24,0,14,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

We compared annual censuses of orb-spider populations on 24 islands with diurnal lizards present, and on 20 islands with diurnal lizards absent, to rainfall over a 10-year period. A strong positive correlation (Pearson r=0.877) was found between mean spider density on nolizard islands and the number of days of rain that occurred 2 months prior to spider censuses; correlation coefficients declined with longer and shorter time periods prior to censuses. Correlation coefficients between mean spider density on lizard islands and rainfall showed a similar pattern but were generally lower than those for no-lizard islands. The strength of the impact of lizards on spiders, measured as the ratio of mean spider density on no-lizard islands to mean spider density on lizard islands, varied considerably and was positively correlated with rainfall; the correlation was highest with number of rain days 6 months prior to spider censuses (r-=0.741). Repeated-measures analysis of variance on the time series of spider densities showed that the lizard factor (present versus absent) varied significantly among years. Split-plot ANOVA with rainfall as a covariate indicated that spider density and the impact of lizards on spider density were both significantly correlated with rainfall. We discuss several hypotheses on the causal mechanisms that integrate abiotic and biotic factors.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS, CTR POPULAT BIOL, DIV BIOL SCI, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA","SPILLER, DA (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS, EVOLUT & ECOL SECT, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA.",,,,,,,39,28,33,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,1995,103,2,,,,,133,139,,10.1007/BF00329072,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RN783,WOS:A1995RN78300001,28306765,,,,2021-09-21,

The effect of group size and phenotypic and ecological similarity on group assembly has not been well-studied. Mixed-species flocks are important subsets of bird communities worldwide. We examined associations within these in relation to flock size, to understand rules of flock assembly, in the Western Ghats of India. We examined the relationship between phenotypic clumping and flock richness using four variables-body size, foraging behavior, foraging height and taxonomic relatedness. Using a null model approach, we found that small flocks were more phenotypically clumped for body size than expected by chance; however, phenotypic clumping decreased as flocks increased in size and approached expected phenotypic variation in large flocks. This pattern was not as clear for foraging height and foraging behavior. We then examined a dataset of 55 flock matrices from 24 sites across the world. We found that sites with smaller flocks had higher values of phenotypic clumping for body size and sites with larger flocks were less phenotypically clumped. This relationship was weakly negative for foraging behavior and not statistically significant for taxonomic relatedness. Unlike most single-species groups, participants in mixed-species flocks appear to be able to separate on different axes of trait similarity. They can gain benefits from similarity on one axis while mitigating competition by dissimilarity on others. Consistent with our results, we speculate that flock assembly was deterministic up to a certain point with participants being similar in body size, but larger flocks tended to approach random phenotypic assemblages of species.","[Bangal, Priti; Sridhar, Hari; Shanker, Kartik] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bengaluru, India; [Sridhar, Hari] Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Bengaluru, India; [Bangal, Priti] Nat Conservancy Fdn, Mysore, Karnataka, India","Bangal, P (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bengaluru, India.; Bangal, P (corresponding author), Nat Conservancy Fdn, Mysore, Karnataka, India.",pritibangal@gmail.com,,,Department of Biotechnology-Indian Institute of Science Partnership Programme; International Foundation for ScienceInternational Foundation for Science [D/4910-1]; Indian National Science Academy,Fieldwork was supported by the funding from the Department of Biotechnology-Indian Institute of Science Partnership Programme and a grant to HS from the International Foundation for Science (grant no.

Here, we describe niche partitioning within a sympatry zone in a fragmented Andean landscape between two closely related flush-pursue species: a high-elevation montane forest dweller, (Myioborus melanocephalus), and a mid-elevation montane forest dweller, (M. miniatus). As all flush-pursuers use very similar hunting techniques involving visual displays to flush and pursue insects in air, and benefit from being the rare predators, ecological sorting between species in sympatry zones should allow their co-existence. We found that both species occupied vegetation resembling their typical allopatric habitats: a mosaic of pastures, clearings, and shrubs with small proportion of high trees for M. melanocephalus, and dense high forests with high proportion of trees, lower irradiance and higher humidity for M. miniatus. M. melanocephalus often foraged in bushes and at lower heights, whereas M. miniatus often foraged in tree crowns. The two species differed relatively little in their foraging technique. These results demonstrate how ecological sorting permits species of divergent elevational distributions and habitats to successfully coexist in sympatric zones where habitat diversity allows both species to find their preferred habitat.","[Jablonski, Piotr G.] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Lab Behav Ecol & Evolut, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Jablonski, Piotr G.] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Borowiec, Marta; Stawarczyk, Tadeusz] Univ Wroclaw, Museum Nat Hist, Sienkiewicza 21, PL-50335 Wroclaw, Poland; [Nowakowski, Jacek J.] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Dept Ecol & Environm Protect, Pl Lodzki 3, Olsztyn, Poland","Nowakowski, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Warmia & Mazury, Dept Ecol & Environm Protect, Pl Lodzki 3, Olsztyn, Poland.",jacek.nowakowski@uwm.edu.pl,"Nowakowski, Jacek/J-2917-2013","Nowakowski, Jacek/0000-0001-9475-2868; Borowiec, Marta/0000-0002-8604-9715; /0000-0002-8333-0106; Stawarczyk, Tadeusz/0000-0002-7255-5334","Yanayacu Biological Station [POKL-04.01.01-00-178/09-00]; Center for Creative Studies, Cosanga, Ecuador [POKL-04.01.01-00-178/09-00]; BK 21 grantMinistry of Education & Human Resources Development (MOEHRD), Republic of Korea; Seoul National University","Research and teaching internship at Yanayacu Biological Station and Center for Creative Studies, Cosanga, Ecuador from the project POKL-04.01.01-00-178/09-00; BK 21 grant to the School of Biological Sciences, Seoul National University; 2019-2020 Convergence Research Grant from the Seoul National University.",,73,0,0,3,3,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,DEC 16,2020,10,1,,,,,,,22024,10.1038/s41598-020-78804-2,,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,PM2SU,WOS:000603656600013,33328506,"gold, Green Published",,,2021-09-21,

One type of indirect interaction is exploitative resource competition, which results from a reduction in plant biomass; another type is that caused by changes in plant traits. These are referred to as indirect effects, mediated, respectively, by biomass and plant traits. The two indirect effect types often occur simultaneously, and they are difficult to partition. To investigate the roles of the two indirect effects on both herbivores, a dynamic one-plant, two-herbivore system model was analyzed assuming the spatiotemporal co-occurrence of the herbivores and the plants' non-specific induced defenses. Our analysis revealed that the densities of coexisting competitively superior and subordinate herbivores were regulated by negative indirect effects mediated by plant biomass and defense, respectively. This indicates that indirect effects mediated by plant biomass and plant traits can be important regulators of herbivore population size in equilibrium with herbivore coexistence. Our results could be generally applicable to plant-herbivore interactions with non-specific plant defense that is induced through both intra- and transgenerational responses.","[Yamauchi, Atsushi; Ohgushi, Takayuki] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Hirano 2-509-3, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan; [Ikegawa, Yusuke] Ryukyu Sankei Co Ltd, Tomigusuku, Okinawa, Japan; [Namba, Toshiyuki] Osaka Prefecture Univ, Sakai, Osaka, Japan","Yamauchi, A (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Hirano 2-509-3, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",a-yama@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Yamauchi, Atsushi/P-9905-2018","Yamauchi, Atsushi/0000-0002-8463-3491","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [19K06851]; International Research Unit of Advanced Future Studies at Kyoto University",This research was supported financially by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 19K06851.

However, little is known about the components that regulate effective CO2 diffusivity in the cell wall (i.e. the ratio between actual porosity and tortuosity, the other two biophysical diffusion properties of cell walls). The aim of this study was to assess, at the interspecific level, potential relationships between cell wall composition, cell wall thickness (T-cw) and g(m). Gymnosperms constitute an ideal group to deepen these relationships, as they present, on average, the thickest cell walls within spermatophytes. We characterized the foliar gas exchange, the morphoanatomical traits related with g(m), the leaf fraction constituted by cell walls and three main components of primary cell walls (hemicelluloses, cellulose and pectins) in seven gymnosperm species. We found that, although the relatively low g(m) of gymnosperms was mainly determined by their elevated T-cw, g(m) was also strongly correlated with cell wall composition, which presumably sets the final effective CO2 diffusivity. The data presented here suggest that (i) differences in g(m) are strongly correlated to the pectins to hemicelluloses and cellulose ratio in gymnosperms, and (ii) variations in cell wall composition may modify effective CO2 diffusivity in the cell wall to compensate the negative impact of thickened walls. We speculate that higher relative pectin content allows higher g(m) because pectins increase cell wall hydrophilicity and CO2 molecules cross the wall dissolved in water.","[Carriqui, Marc; Nadal, Miquel; Clemente-Moreno, Maria J.; Gago, Jorge; Flexas, Jaume] Univ Illes Balears UIB, Agroenvironm & Water Econ Inst INAGEA, Res Grp Plant Biol Mediterranean Condit, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Illes Balears, Spain; [Carriqui, Marc] Univ Tasmania UTAS, Sch Nat Sci, Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Miedes, Eva] Univ Politecn Madrid UPM, Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria INIA, Ctr Biotecnol & Genom Plantes, Campus Montegancedo UPM, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Miedes, Eva] Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Agron Alimentaria & Biosi, Dept Biotecnol Biol Vegetal, Madrid 28040, Spain","Carriqui, M (corresponding author), Univ Illes Balears UIB, Agroenvironm & Water Econ Inst INAGEA, Res Grp Plant Biol Mediterranean Condit, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Illes Balears, Spain.; Carriqui, M (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania UTAS, Sch Nat Sci, Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",mcarriqui@gmail.com,"Carriqui, Marc/I-5544-2014; Gago, Jorge/N-3591-2013; Clemente, Maria Jose/G-5339-2011; Miedes Miedes, Eva/A-6003-2015","Carriqui, Marc/0000-0002-0153-2602; Gago, Jorge/0000-0002-4293-0105; Clemente-Moreno, Maria Jose/0000-0003-3288-6312; Nadal, Miquel/0000-0002-5434-7953; Miedes Miedes, Eva/0000-0003-2899-1494","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO, Spain) [CTM2014-53902-C2-1-P, BES-2015-072578]; ERDF (FEDER)European Commission [CTM2014-53902-C2-1-P]; Conselleria d'Educacio, Cultura i Universitats (Govern de les Illes Balears) [FPI/1700/2014]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF) [BES-2015-072578, FPI/1700/2014]","This work was supported by the project CTM2014-53902-C2-1-P from the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (MINECO, Spain) and the ERDF (FEDER).

Predominant microbial community identification and multivariate analysis indicate that these reactors showed different microbial community structure, but these differences had no impact on the overall AnMBR performance. Instead, core microbial genera which occurred in >= 90% of sludge (20 genera) and biofilm (12 genera) samples could potentially account for the AnMBR performance. A further calculation on net growth rate (NGR) of core genera in sludge suggested distribution into two main groups (i.e., I: low relative abundance and NGR, II: high relative abundance or high NGR). Consistent positive correlations between bacterial genera were observed among those that exhibited either high relative abundance or high NGR. The anaerobic microbial consortium in both sludge and biofilm were largely affected by stochastic dispersal and migration processes (i.e., neutral assembly). However, Acinetobacter spp. and Methanobacterium spp. occurred consistently in higher frequency in the biofilm but in lower occurrence frequency in the AnMBR permeate. Findings from this study suggest first, specific core microorganisms exist in the sludge regardless of the operating conditions of the AnMBRs, and second, prevention of biofoulant layer on anaerobic membranes can be devised by minimizing attachment of microbes on surfaces in a non-selective manner.","[Cheng, Hong; Hong, Pei-Ying] KAUST, WDRC, Biol & Environm Sci & Engn Div BESE, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Cheng, Dan] Nanyang Technol Univ, SCELSE, Singapore 637551, Singapore; [Mao, Junwen] Huzhou Univ, Dept Phys, Huzhou 313000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Mao, Junwen; Lu, Ting] Univ Illinois, Dept Bioengn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Hong, PY (corresponding author), KAUST, WDRC, Biol & Environm Sci & Engn Div BESE, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia.",peiying.hong@kaust.edu.sa,"; Hong, Peiying/A-4813-2009","Cheng, Hong/0000-0002-4943-9060; Hong, Peiying/0000-0002-4474-6600",KAUST Center Competitive Funding [FCC/1/1971-32-01],The authors would like to thank Mr. Liuwei Wang for providing technical assistance on drawing by R.

Amplicon 16S rRNA sequencing suggested that EPA and DHA had a greater contribution to the action of marine lipids than DPA both in cattle and sheep. Certain effects were exclusive to each ruminant species, which underlines the complexity of rumen microbial responses to dietary fatty acids. Based on changes in bacterial abundance, Barnesiella, Prevotella, Paraprevotella, Hallela, Anaerovorax, Succiniclasticum, Ruminococcus and Ruminobacter may be involved in the ruminal response in biohydrogenation to the addition of marine lipids, but further research is necessary to confirm their actual role in ruminal lipid metabolism.","[Carreno, D.; Toral, P.

Here, we present a thorough quantitative description of acoustic parameters in release and distress calls in the three European spadefoot toad species, genus Pelobates. We also explored the intra- and interspecific variation and effects of body size on acoustic traits. We analysed a total of 749 release calls of 34 individuals of Pelobates fuscus and P. syriacus, and 312 distress calls of 36 individuals of P. fuscus, P. syriacus and P. cultripes. Release calls consisted of a note with one to three initial pulses of lower energy and a group of consecutive pulses characterized by higher energy in both species analysed. The structure of the distress calls was similar in all three species: loud, explosive, cat meow-like, single multi-pulsed notes rich in harmonics. Some of the variation among species in acoustic parameters in the release and distress calls is related to body size. Acoustic properties for both release and distress calls showed high levels of variability in all species. This pattern of variation is different from what is regularly found in the more conservative advertisement calls, and we advocate that such high variability is possible because release and distress call are not signals with divergent evolutionary history among related species.","[Stanescu, Florina; Cogalniceanu, Dan] Ovidius Univ, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Constanta, Romania; [Stanescu, Florina; Cogalniceanu, Dan] Chelonia Romania, Bucharest, Romania; [Forti, Lucas R.] Univ Estadual Campinas UNICAMP, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Hist Nat Anfibios Brasileiros LaHNAB, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Forti, Lucas R.] Univ Estadual Campinas UNICAMP, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Multiusuario Bioacust LMBio, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Marquez, Rafael] Natl Museum Nat Sci CSIC, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Evolut, Fonoteca Zool, Madrid, Spain","Forti, LR (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas UNICAMP, Dept Biol Anim, Lab Hist Nat Anfibios Brasileiros LaHNAB, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",l16649@dac.unicamp.br,"Cogalniceanu, Dan/B-7065-2011; Florina, Stanescu/I-7510-2016; Forti, Lucas/E-8207-2013","Cogalniceanu, Dan/0000-0003-2959-014X; Florina, Stanescu/0000-0001-6872-664X; Forti, Lucas/0000-0003-3057-2141; Marquez, Rafael/0000-0002-2070-860X","SYNTHESYS Project - European Community Research Infrastructure Action under the FP7 'Capacities' Programme, at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (CSIC) [SYNTHESYS ES-TAF-2814, SYNTHESYS ES-TAF-6704]; Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDIConsiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI) [PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-0173]; Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CCCDI-UEFISCDIConsiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI) [105 BM/2017]; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2009/13987-2, 2013/21519-4]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [150041/2017-9]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, SpainSpanish Government [TATANKA CGL2011-25062, CGL2010-09700]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain [CGL2011-16159-E]","This work received support from the SYNTHESYS Project http://www.synthesys.info/which is financed by European Community Research Infrastructure Action under the FP7 'Capacities' Programme, at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (CSIC) [grant numbers SYNTHESYS ES-TAF-2814, SYNTHESYS ES-TAF-6704]; the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI [grant number PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-0173] and CCCDI-UEFISCDI - project No. 105 BM/2017; Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) by a doctoral grant [grant number #2009/13987-2] and a fellowship [grant number #2013/21519-4]; The National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) provided a fellowship [grant number #150041/2017-9].

It is especially frequent in hybrids and very valuable in many crops. The genus Annona belongs to the Annonaceae, a family that includes several fruit tree crops, such as cherimoya (Annona cherimola), sugar apple (Annona squamosa), their hybrid atemoya (A. cherimola x A. squamosa) or pawpaw (Asimina triloba). In this work, genome content was evaluated in several Annona species, A. triloba and atemoya. Surprisingly, while the hybrid atemoya has been reported as diploid, flow cytometry analysis of a progeny obtained from an interspecific cross between A. cherimola and A. squamosa showed an unusual ploidy variability that was also confirmed karyotype analysis. While the progeny from intraspecific crosses of A. cherimola showed polyploid genotypes that ranged from 2.5 to 33%, the hybrid atemoyas from the interspecific cross showed 35% of triploids from a total of 186 genotypes analyzed. With the aim of understanding the possible implications of the production of non-reduced gametes, pollen performance, pollen size and frequency distribution of pollen grains was quantified in the progeny of this cross and the parents. A large polymorphism in pollen grain size was found within the interspecific progeny with higher production of unreduced pollen in triploids (38%) than in diploids (29%). Moreover, using PCR amplification of selected microsatellite loci, while 13.7% of the pollen grains from the diploids showed two alleles, 41.28% of the grains from the triploids amplified two alleles and 5.63% showed up to three alleles. This suggests that the larger pollen grains could correspond to diploid and, in a lower frequency, to triploid pollen. Pollen performance was also affected with lower pollen germination in the hybrid triploids than in both diploid parents. The results confirm a higher percentage of polyploids in the interspecific cross, affecting pollen grain size and pollen performance. The occurrence of unreduced gametes in A. cherimola, A. squamosa and their interspecific progeny that may result in abnormalities of ploidy such as the triploids and tetraploids observed in this study, opens an interesting opportunity to study polyploidy in Annonaceae.","[Martin, Carolina; Viruel, Maria.

Overcompensation can contribute to the Hydra effect, wherein added mortality increases equilibrium population size. One hypothesis for overcompensation is that added mortality eases density dependence, increasing survival to adulthood (temporal separation of mortality and density dependence). Mortality early in the life cycle is therefore predicted to cause overcompensation, whereas mortality later in the life cycle is not. Another hypothesis for overcompensation is that threat of mortality (e.g., from predation) causes behavioral changes that reduce overexploitation of resources, allowing resource recovery, and increasing production of adults (prudent resource exploitation). Behaviorally active predation cues alone are therefore predicted to cause overcompensation. We tested these predictions in two experiments with larvae of two species of Aedes. As predicted, early mortality yielded greater production of adults, and of adult females, and greater estimated rate of population increase than did later mortality. Addition of water-borne predation cues usually reduced browsing on surfaces in late-stage larvae, but contrary to prediction, resulted in neither significantly greater production of adult mosquitoes nor significantly greater estimated rate of increase. Thus we have strong evidence that timing of mortality contributes to overcompensation and the Hydra effect in mosquitoes. Evidence that predation cues alone can result in overcompensation via prudent resource exploitation is lacking. We expect the overcompensation in response to early mortality will be common in organisms with complex life cycles, density dependence among juveniles, and developmental control of populations.","[McIntire, Kristina M.; Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Juliano, SA (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",sajulian@ilstu.edu,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553; McIntire, Kristina/0000-0002-1387-5637","NIAIDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [1R15AI094322-01A1, 1R15AI124005-01]; Illinois State University's office of Research and Sponsored Programs; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI094322, R15AI124005] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank K.

It is often assumed that changes in environmental parameters affect organisms in a nonadditive way and multifactorial experiments are therefore needed to obtain a better prediction of the effects of climate change. We studied experimentally how combinations of high temperature, low light and high nitrogen (HN) availability affect eelgrass (Zostera marina), which is an important foundation species on the northern hemisphere. Plants were cultured under optimal (15 degrees C) and high (25 degrees C) temperature, limiting and saturating light, and low and high ammonium availability in a 3-factorial design. We found that individual exposure to heat and shade, respectively, had a negative effect on eelgrass while the effect of exposure to HN-availability alone was less harmful. Exposure to combinations of two or three stressors simultaneously had a stronger (negative) effect on eelgrass than exposure to each stressor individually, but the combined effects of exposure to multiple stressors were largely similar to the expected additive responses. A synergetic effect was only found in case of mortality when eelgrass plants were exposed to all three stressors simultaneously. The effects of exposure to single or multiple stressors could largely be explained from alterations in the C-budget of the plants: exposure to one or more stressors lowered the acquisition of C, drained the C-reserves and sometimes allocated energy to defense or repair processes instead of growth resulting in reduced growth and higher mortality.","[Moreno-Marin, Francisco; Pedersen, Morten Foldager] Roskilde Univ, DSE, Roskilde, Denmark; [Moreno-Marin, Francisco; Guillermo Brun, Fernando] Univ Cadiz, Fac Marine & Environm Sci, Dept Biol, Campus Excelencia Int Mar CEIMAR, Cadiz, Spain","Moreno-Marin, F (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, DSE, Roskilde, Denmark.; Moreno-Marin, F (corresponding author), Univ Cadiz, Fac Marine & Environm Sci, Dept Biol, Campus Excelencia Int Mar CEIMAR, Cadiz, Spain.",mfp@ruc.dk,"Brun, Fernando G.

Three UASB reactors were operated for 219 days at ambient temperature with an organic loading rate (OLR) of between 0.3 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) and 20 kg COD m(-3) d(-1). One reactor was operated without the addition of chitosan, while the other two were operated with the addition of chitosan doses of 2.4 mg gVSS(-1) two times. The three reactors were all able to treat the OLR tested with COD removal efficiencies greater than 90%. However, the time required to reach stable operation was considerably reduced in the chitosan-assisted reactors. The development of granules in the reactors with chitosan was accelerated and granules larger than 2000 mu m were only observed in these reactors. In addition, these granules exhibited better physicochemical characteristics: the mean particle diameter (540 and 613 mu m) was approximately two times greater than in the control reactor (300 mu m), and the settling velocities exceeded 35 m h(-1). The extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the reactors with the chitosan was found to be higher than in the control reactor. The protein-EPS content has been correlated with the granule size. The analyses of the microbial communities, performed through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and high-throughput sequencing, revealed that the syntrophic microorganisms belonging to genus Geobacter and the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanocorpusculum labreanum were predominant in the granules. Other methanogens like Methanosaeta species were found earlier in the chitosan-assisted reactors than in the control reactor. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although female-biased SSD predominates among insects, the proximate ecological and evolutionary factors promoting this phenomenon remain largely unstudied. Here, we employ modern phylogenetic comparative methods on eight subfamilies of Iberian grasshoppers (85 species) to examine the validity of different models of evolution of body size and SSD and explore how they are shaped by a suite of ecological variables (habitat specialization, substrate use, altitude) and/or constrained by different evolutionary pressures (female fecundity, strength of sexual selection, length of the breeding season). Body size disparity primarily accumulated late in the history of the group and did not follow a Brownian motion pattern, indicating the existence of directional evolution for this trait. We found support for the converse of Rensch's rule (i.e. females are proportionally bigger than males in large species) across all taxa but not within the two most speciose subfamilies (Gomphocerinae and Oedipodinae), which showed an isometric pattern. Our results do not provide support for the fecundity or sexual selection hypotheses, and we did not find evidence for significant effects of habitat use. Contrary to that expected, we found that species with narrower reproductive window are less dimorphic in size than those that exhibit a longer breeding cycle, suggesting that male protandry cannot solely account for the evolution of female-biased SSD in Orthoptera. Our study highlights the need to consider alternatives to the classical evolutionary hypotheses when trying to explain why in certain insect groups males remain small.","[Garcia-Navas, V.; Ortego, J.] Estn Biol Donana EBD CSIC, Dept Integrat Ecol, Avda Americo Vespucio S-N, E-41092 Seville, Spain; [Noguerales, V.; Cordero, P.

However, relationships among this action, disappearance of those PUFA in the rumen, and potential detrimental consequences on ruminal fermentation remain uncertain. This study compared the effect of 20:5n-3 (eicosapentaenoic acid; EPA), 22:5n-3 (docosapentaenoic acid; DPA), and 22:6n-3 (docosahexaenoic acid; DHA) on rumen fermentation and BH of C18 FA and was conducted simultaneously in cows and sheep to provide novel insights into interspecies differences. The trial was performed in vitro using batch cultures of rumen microorganisms with inocula collected from cannulated cows and ewes. The PUFA were added at a dose of 2% incubated dry matter, and treatment effects on ruminal C18 FA concentrations, PUFA disappearances, and fermentation parameters (gas production, ammonia and volatile FA concentrations, and dry matter and neutral detergent fiber disappearances) were examined after 24 h of incubation. A principal component analysis suggested that responses to PUFA treatments explained most of the variability; those of ruminant species were of lower relevance. Overall, EPA and DHA were equally effective for inhibiting the saturation of trans-11 18:1 to 18:0 and had a similar influence on ruminal fermentation in cows and sheep (e.g., reductions in gas production and acetate:propionate ratio). Nevertheless, DHA further promoted alternative BH pathways that lead to trans-10 18:1 accumulation, and EPA seemed to have specific effects on 18:3n-3 metabolism. Only minor variations attributable to DPA were observed in the studied parameters, suggesting a low contribution of this FA to the action of marine lipids. Although most changes due to the added PUFA were comparable in bovine and ovine, there were also relevant specificities, such as a stronger inhibition of 18:0 formation in cows and a greater increase in 18:3n-3 metabolites in sheep. No direct relationship between in vitro disappearance of the incubated PUFA and effect on BH (in particular, inhibition of the last step) was found in either cows or ewes, calling into question a putative link between extent of disappearance and toxicity for microbiota. Conversely, an association between the influence of these PUFA on ruminal lipid metabolism and fermentation may exist in both species. In vivo verification of these findings would be advisable.","[Toral, P.

It is grown especially in small-scale agriculture. From an agronomic perspective, it is predominantly indeterminate and climbing type of growth is associated with high labor and materials required to grow the crop with support structures. Intercropping (i.e., maize-runner bean) and seed inoculation using bio-compounds (i.e., rhizobacteria) have resulted in more efficient resource utilization, reduced risk to the environment and diminished production costs, which are valuable practices linked to sustainable agriculture. Cold tolerance and hive management due to allogamy are also distinctive features of runner bean, production that have been studied. From a genomic standpoint, runner bean has been very little studied, despite the abundant development of molecular markers and genome sequencing of other legumes in the last decade, and more specifically common bean (P. vulgaris). The high genetic variability of runner bean is precious for breeding purposes, particularly as a source of disease resistance and cold tolerance. However, the lack of characterization of the P. coccineus germplasm restricts its utilization as donor species for inter-specific hybridization, and consequently limits its use in other Phaseolus breeding programs (i.e., common bean). Developing more broadly adapted, determinate cultivars that facilitate mechanical harvesting, assessing the potential presence of heterosis for hybrid seed production, and characterizing the germplasm of P. coccineus more extensively are great challenges and opportunities in the future that would increase its cultivation on a broader scale worldwide.

Interactions between humans and wild swine leading to pathogen transmission could come from different ways, being hunters and game professionals the most exposed to acquiring infections from wild swine. However, increasing human settlements in semi-natural areas, outdoor activities, socio-economic changes and food habits may increase the rate of exposure to wild swine zoonotic pathogens and to potentially emerging pathogens from wild swine. Frequent and increasing contact rate between humans and wild swine points to an increasing chance of zoonotic pathogens arising from wild swine to be transmitted to humans. Whether this frequent contact could lead to new zoonotic pathogens emerging from wild swine to cause human epidemics or emerging disease outbreaks is difficult to predict, and assessment should be based on thorough epidemiologic surveillance. Additionally, several gaps in knowledge on wild swine global population dynamics trends and wild swine-zoonotic pathogen interactions should be addressed to correctly assess the potential role of wild swine in the emergence of diseases in humans. In this work, viruses such as hepatitis E virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Influenza virus and Nipah virus, and bacteria such as Salmonella spp., Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp. and Leptospira spp. have been identified as the most prone to be transmitted from wild swine to humans on the basis of geographic spread in wild swine populations worldwide, pathogen circulation rates in wild swine populations, wild swine population trends in endemic areas, susceptibility of humans to infection, transmissibility from wild swine to humans and existing evidence of wild swine-human transmission events.","[Ruiz-Fons, F.] IREC, Spanish Wildlife Res Inst, Hlth & Biotechnol SaBio Grp, Ronda Toledo S-N, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain; [Ruiz-Fons, F.] CSIC UCLM JCCCM, Ciudad Real, Spain","Ruiz-Fons, F (corresponding author), IREC, Spanish Wildlife Res Inst, Hlth & Biotechnol SaBio Grp, Ronda Toledo S-N, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain.",josefrancisco.ruiz@uclm.es,"Ruiz-Fons, Francisco/K-3161-2014","Ruiz-Fons, Francisco/0000-0002-0820-5292",EC FP7 ANTIG-ONE project [278976]; Ramon y Cajal program of the Spanish Ministry for the Economy and Competitiveness,"This review arose from the meeting of the 'Wildlife Panel' in the Workshop 'Interspecies Barriers' of EC FP7 ANTIG-ONE project (278976).

For wetland-dependent amphibians, forested buffers may mitigate timber-harvest impacts, but little empirical research has focused on buffers around lentic habitats. We conducted a landscape experiment to examine how spotted salamander and wood frog reproductive output (i.e., eggmass and metamorph production) respond to clearcutting mediated by buffers of different widths (i.e., uncut, 30 m buffer, 100 m buffer) at ephemeral pools in an industrial forest. We found complex interactions between buffer treatment and reproductive output, which were strongly mediated by hydroperiod. Overall, reproductive output was most sensitive at 30 m-buffer pools and for salamanders, but responses diverged across productivity metrics even within these categories. Notably, for both cut treatments over time, while salamander eggmass abundance decreased, metamorph productivity (i.e., snout-vent length [SVL] and abundance) tended to increase. For example, average metamorph SVLs were predicted to lengthen between 0.2 and 0.4 mm per year post-cut. Additionally, typical relationships between reproductive output and hydroperiod (as indicated by the reference treatment) were disrupted for both species in both cut treatments. For example, long-hydroperiod pools produced more salamander metamorphs than short-hydroperiod pools in both the reference and 30 m-buffer treatments, but the rate of increase was lower in the 30 m-buffer treatment such that a long-hydroperiod pool in the reference treatment was predicted to produce, on average, 24 more metamorphs than a similar pool in the 30 m-buffer treatment. From a conservation perspective, our results highlight the importance of evaluating both terrestrial and aquatic responses to terrestrial habitat disturbance, since responses may be reinforcing (i.e., exert similarly positive or negative effects, with the potential for amplification in the aquatic habitat) or decoupled (i.e., operate independently or be negatively correlated, with responses in the aquatic habitat potentially dampening or counteracting responses in the terrestrial habitat).","[Powell, Jessica S.

The analysis deciphered novel pathways and mapped genes of interest in both organisms during the infection. This network revealed a high degree of connectivity in many of the previously recognized pathways in Z. mays such as jasmonic acid, ethylene, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). For the pathogen A. flavus, a link between aflatoxin production and vesicular transport was identified within the network. There was significant interspecies correlation of expression between Z. mays and A. flavus for a subset of 104 Z. mays, and 1942 A. flavus genes. This resulted in an interspecies subnetwork enriched in multiple Z. mays genes involved in the production of ROS. In addition to the ROS from Z mays, there was enrichment in the vesicular transport pathways and the aflatoxin pathway for A. flavus. Included in these genes, a key aflatoxin cluster regulator, AfIS, was found to be co-regulated with multiple Z. mays ROS producing genes within the network, suggesting AfIS may be monitoring host ROS levels.

Here, we used the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis as a model species to investigate connectivity patterns within the Berlengas and Arrabida Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) along the central Portuguese west coast. We generated an atlas of location-specific environmental markers based on the microchemistry of bivalve larval shells (using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry). This atlas was then employed to trace the natal origins of newly settled mussels and generate connectivity matrices among populations. Our results reflected 3 distinctive chemical signatures in larval shells, corresponding to 3 regions: Estremadura, Cascais and Arrabida. Linear discriminant analyses allowed for a high reclassification success (average of 79.5% of jackknifed cross-validated cases correctly assigned) based on 8 of the 16 trace elements analyzed (B, P, Co, Cu, Zn, Ce, Pb and U). The population connectivity matrix identified different dispersal pathways for mussel larvae, in particular a predominantly northward dispersion pattern in July 2013. This pattern was consistent with simultaneous environmental physical data, which confirmed an extended period of wind reversal and upwelling relaxation. The Arrabida MPA was an important source population for the other 2 regions and showed high rates of self-recruitment but limited connectivity to the Berlengas MPA. These direct measures of demographic connectivity can be a powerful tool to inform policymakers on the conservation and management of ecologically coherent networks of protected areas in coastal marine ecosystems.","[Gomes, Ines; Peteiro, Laura G.; Albuquerque, Rui; Queiroga, Henrique] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Gomes, Ines; Peteiro, Laura G.; Albuquerque, Rui; Queiroga, Henrique] Univ Aveiro, CESAM, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Gomes, Ines] Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Res Grp, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Peteiro, Laura G.] Univ Vigo, Fac Ciencias Mar, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Nolasco, Rita; Dubert, Jesus] Univ Aveiro, Dept Fis, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Nolasco, Rita; Dubert, Jesus] Univ Aveiro, Ctr Estudos Ambiente & Mar CESAM, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Swearer, Stephen Edward] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia","Gomes, I (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.; Gomes, I (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, CESAM, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.; Gomes, I (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Res Grp, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",istgomes@gmail.com,"Dubert, Jesus/B-2803-2009; Dubert, Jesus/B-7517-2008; Nolasco, Rita TS/D-1809-2019; Swearer, Stephen/X-4882-2018; SWEARER, STEPHEN/AAC-1527-2020; Peteiro, Laura G/B-6179-2014; Queiroga, Henrique/C-5134-2008; Albuquerque, Rui/V-3796-2018","Dubert, Jesus/0000-0002-3338-6777; Swearer, Stephen/0000-0001-6381-9943; SWEARER, STEPHEN/0000-0001-6381-9943; Peteiro, Laura G/0000-0001-9382-2502; Queiroga, Henrique/0000-0002-2338-0013; Gomes, Ines/0000-0002-5725-5720; Albuquerque, Rui/0000-0001-6159-9369; nolasco, maria rita/0000-0003-1942-8800","Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [PTDC/BIA-BIC/120483/2010]; FCT under the COMPETE Programme; European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission; Ministerio da Ciencia, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [BI/CESAM/PTDC/BIA-BIC/120483/2010]; Xunta de Galicia, SpainXunta de Galicia [POS-A/2012/189]; MARES grant; Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate programme [FPA 2011-0016]","The authors thank the following individuals and institutions for support and logistic assistance during fieldwork.

However, the fitness benefits of different habitats may vary across ages and between sexes. By quantifying microhabitat choice in relation to age or sex, as well as the specific fitness consequences of habitat selection, we can better understand the factors that shape the way organisms distribute themselves across landscapes. Studies of Anolis lizards have provided critical insights into population and community structure, but most studies have focused on interspecific variation in habitat use, rather than intraspecific patterns. We quantified habitat use of Anolis sagrei at two scales (microhabitat and macrohabitat) for males and females of two distinct age classes (juvenile vs adult). We show that age, sex, size, and macrohabitat have significant effects on how A. sagrei utilize available microhabitat and that age, sex, size, and season influence macrohabitat use. In addition, large individuals of both age classes had increased survival during the breeding season. However, body size did not influence overwinter survival, but lizards that used relatively low perches had increased overwinter survival. Overall, this study demonstrates that the complex variation in habitat use by A. sagrei is explained by interactions among age, sex, size, season, and habitat scale. Habitat choice behaviors can have important effects on fitness, yet optimal habitat may vary across ages and between sexes. In this paper, we quantified microhabitat and macrohabitat use of the brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) and subsequently estimated selection on these behaviors via mark recapture. We show that the complex variation in habitat use by A. sagrei is explained by interactions among age, sex, size, season, and habitat scale. In addition, body size influenced survival of both age classes during the breeding season but not over winter. However, lizards that used relatively low perches had increased overwinter survival. These findings provide new insights into the factors that shape the way these organisms distribute themselves across landscapes and provide a rare assessment of selection on behavioral traits.","[Delaney, David M.; Warner, Daniel A.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Delaney, David M.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Warner, Daniel A.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Delaney, DM (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.; Delaney, DM (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",dmdelane@iastate.edu,"Delaney, David/J-4135-2019","Delaney, David/0000-0002-7010-840X; Warner, Daniel/0000-0001-7231-7785",UAB Department of Biology; UAB Graduate School; Sigma Xi; Alabama Academy of Science,"We thank Amanda Clark, Corey Cates, Albert Chung, Robin Costello, John David Curlis, Ethan Kahrl, Ariel Kahrl, Nick Galt, Darren Langkilde, Esther Langkilde, Tracy Langkilde, Phillip Pearson, Aaron Reedy, Luke Tinsley, and Frank Wideman for their assistance with field work.

Here, we studied the genetic basis for a recessive brachytic dwarfism trait (dw) in peach (Prunus persica) that has little or no effect on fruit development. A sequencing-based mapping strategy positioned dw on the distal end of chromosome 6. Further sequence analysis and fine mapping identified a candidate gene for dw as a nonfunctional allele of the gibberellic acid receptor GID1c. Expression of the two GID1-like genes found in peach, PpeGID1c and PpeGID1b, was analyzed. GID1c was predominantly expressed in actively growing vegetative tissues, whereas GID1b was more highly expressed in reproductive tissues. Silencing of GID1c in plum via transgenic expression of a hairpin construct led to a dwarf phenotype similar to that of dw/dw peaches. In general, the degree of GID1c silencing corresponded to the degree of dwarfing. The results suggest that PpeGID1c serves a primary role in vegetative growth and elongation, whereas GID1b probably functions to regulate gibberellic acid perception in reproductive organs. Modification of GID1c expression could provide a rational approach to control tree size without impairing fruit development.","[Hollender, Courtney A.; Srinivasan, Chinnathambi; Scorza, Ralph; Dardick, Chris] USDA ARS, Appalachian Fruit Res Stn, 2217 Wiltshire Rd, Kearneysville, WV 25430 USA; [Hadiarto, Toto] BB Biogen, Jl Tentara Pelajar 3A, Bogor, Indonesia","Dardick, C (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Appalachian Fruit Res Stn, 2217 Wiltshire Rd, Kearneysville, WV 25430 USA.",chris.dardick@ars.usda.gov,,,Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [10891264],"The authors would like to acknowledge Mark Demuth for generating and maintaining the peach tree population, Michael Whitaker for assistance with cloning, Elizabeth Lutton for screening HRM markers and Emma Acly for assistance with tree measurements.

Here, we compared seed dispersal fitness in two co-occurring plant species (Armeniaca sibirica and Amygdalus davidiana) that inhabit warm temperate deciduous forest in northern China. We tested the hypothesis that seed trait-mediated selection by rodents may influence mutualistic interactions with rodents and then seedling establishment of co-occurring plant species. A. davidiana seeds are larger and harder (thick endocarps) than A. sibirica seeds, but they have similar levels of nutrients (crude fat, crude protein), caloric value and tannin. More A. sibirica seedlings are found in the field. Semi-natural enclosure tests indicated that the two seed species were both harvested by the same six rodent species, but that A. sibirica had mutualistic interactions (scatter hoarding) with four rodent species (Apodemus peninsulae, A. agrarius, Sciurotamias davidianus, Tamias sibiricus), and A. davidiana with only one (S. davidianus). Tagged seed dispersal experiments in the field indicated that more A. sibirica seeds were scatter-hoarded by rodents, and more A. sibirica seeds survived to the next spring and became seedlings. A. sibirica seeds derive more benefit from seed dispersal by rodents than A. davidiana seeds, particularly in years with limited seed dispersers, which well explained the higher seedling recruitment of A. sibirica compared with that of A. davidiana under natural conditions. Our results suggest that seed dispersers may play a significant role in seedling recruitment and indirect competition between co-occurring plant species.","[Zhang, Hongmao] Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Anim Behav Res Grp, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hongmao; Yan, Chuan; Zhang, Zhibin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Chang, Gang] Shaanxi Inst Zool, Xian 710032, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Zhang, HM (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Anim Behav Res Grp, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Zhang, HM; Zhang, ZB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhanghm@mail.ccnu.edu.cn; yanc@ioz.ac.cn; snow1178@snnu.edu.cn; zhangzb@ioz.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31372212, 31172102, 31330013]; Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KJZD-EW-TZ-L01]","We thank Fusheng Wang, Wei Wang and Xianying Shang for assistance with seed collection and field studies.

The findings are discussed in relation to performance selection in terms of organismal function as a potential mechanism underlying integration. Interspecific shape covariation was quantified by two-block partial least-squares (2B-PLS) analysis of 3D landmark data within a phylogenetic context. Specifically, we compared pairs of anatomically connected bones (within-limbs) and pairs of both serially homologous and functional equivalent bones (between-limbs). The statistical results of all the comparisons suggest that the carnivoran appendicular skeleton is highly integrated. Strikingly, the main shape covariation relates to bone robustness in all cases. A bootstrap test was used to compare the degree of integration between specialized cursorial taxa (i.e., those whose forelimbs are primarily involved in locomotion) and noncursorial species (i.e., those whose forelimbs are involved in more functions than their hindlimb) showed that cursors have a more integrated appendicular skeleton than noncursors. The findings demonstrate that natural selection can influence the pattern and degree of morphological integration by increasing the degree of bone shape covariation in parallel to ecological specialization.","[Martin-Serra, Alberto; Figueirido, Borja; Antonio Perez-Claros, Juan; Palmqvist, Paul] Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Geol, Malaga 20971, Spain","Martin-Serra, A (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ecol & Geol, Campus Teatinos S-N, Malaga 20971, Spain.",almarse@uma.es,"Figueirido, Borja/AAV-7882-2020; Palmqvist, Paul/B-5378-2013; Martin-Serra, Alberto/C-3460-2015; Figueirido, Borja/G-9665-2015","Figueirido, Borja/0000-0003-2542-3977; Palmqvist, Paul/0000-0002-6630-6956; Martin-Serra, Alberto/0000-0003-0221-1103; Figueirido, Borja/0000-0003-2542-3977",PhD Research Fellowship (FPU) from the Ministerio de Educacion y CienciaGerman Research Foundation (DFG); Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [CGL2012-37866],"We are especially grateful to C.

However, some species may increase their levels of circulating carotenoids by ingesting unusual food. We tested whether the plasma concentration of carotenoids scales to the three-quarter power of mass in nine predatory and scavenger raptor species. No significant allometric relationships were found due to the unusually high concentrations of carotenoids in the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus and the Andean condor Vultur gryphus. To assess whether these two species deviate from the allometric rule through the exploitation of unusual sources of carotenoids, or due to a physiological adaptation to improve the uptake of carotenoids, we determined allometric patterns in individuals of these two species kept in captivity with an exclusive diet of flesh. Our results provided support for the allometric rule because the slope of the allometric equation did not differ from a three-quarter exponent when carotenoid levels of the two outliers were replaced by those of captive birds. This adjustment to the allometric rule suggests a lack of any physiological adaptation to improve the uptake of the low concentrations of carotenoids contained in flesh. Differences between species in carotenoid incorporation into the bloodstream may be ultimately due to contrasting evolutionary history, physiology and associated colour-signalling strategies, but proximately due to the acquisition of these micronutrients from both usual and unusual dietary sources.","[Blanco, Guillermo; Bautista, Luis M.] CSIC, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Madrid, Spain; [Hornero-Mendez, Damaso] CSIC, Inst Grasa, Food Phytochem Dept, E-41080 Seville, Spain; [Lambertucci, Sergio A.] Univ Nacl Comahue, CONICET, Lab Ecotono INIBIOMA, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Wiemeyer, Guillermo] Jardin Zool Ciudad Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Wiemeyer, Guillermo] Peregrine Fund, Boise, ID USA; [Sanchez-Zapata, Jose A.] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Appl Biol, Orihuela, Spain; [Hiraldo, Fernando; Donazar, Jose A.] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, E-41080 Seville, Spain","Blanco, G (corresponding author), CSIC, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Madrid, Spain.",g.blanco@csic.es,"Bautista, Luis M./B-1735-2008; Sanchez-Zapata, Jose Antonio/H-1413-2015; Hornero-Mendez, Damaso/H-2507-2012; Blanco, Guillermo/L-3170-2014; Hiraldo, Fernando/AAA-8314-2019","Bautista, Luis M./0000-0002-1503-652X; Sanchez-Zapata, Jose Antonio/0000-0001-8230-4953; Hornero-Mendez, Damaso/0000-0002-1781-5703; Blanco, Guillermo/0000-0001-5742-4929; LAMBERTUCCI, SERGIO/0000-0002-2624-2185; Donazar, Jose Antonio/0000-0002-9433-9755","Fundacion Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria from the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [BIOCON-08-126, CGL2009-12753-C02-01]; CYTED [112RT0445]",This work was funded by Fundacion Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria project BIOCON-08-126 and project CGL2009-12753-C02-01 from the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad.

The present study assesses the efficacy of 11 guilds, formed from both larval and adult stages of four locally abundant aphidophagous coccinellids (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), while exploiting the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The observed antagonistic effects within these guilds are resultants of enhanced predator-predator interactions due to the size and diversity of guild predators. Smaller ladybird predators maintained their usual body mass, probably by increasing their conversion efficiencies to compensate for their reduced prey consumption. However, larger ladybirds reported loss in their body mass, owing to their higher energy needs. The overall guild conversion efficiencies and growth rates were reduced. Among the experimental guilds, the observed prey mortalities were relatively higher in two-predator guilds, and within these two-predator combinations, the higher prey mortalities were recorded in those guilds where Coccinella septempunctata was one of the predators.","[Omkar; Mishra, Geetanjali; Kumar, Bhupendra; Singh, Neha; Pandey, Garima] Univ Lucknow, Dept Zool, Ctr Excellence Biocontrol Insect Pests, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India","Omkar (corresponding author), Univ Lucknow, Dept Zool, Ctr Excellence Biocontrol Insect Pests, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India.",omkaar55@hotmail.com,"Mishra, Geetanjali/X-7796-2019; Kumar, Bhupendra/AAR-9719-2020","Mishra, Geetanjali/0000-0001-8976-4602; Kumar, Bhupendra/0000-0002-7602-9681","Government of Uttar Pradesh, India","The authors are thankful to the Government of Uttar Pradesh, India for providing funds in the form of Centre of Excellence in Biocontrol of Insect Pests and also to Head, Department of Zoology, University of Lucknow for laboratory facilities and encouragements.",,73,8,12,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0008-347X,1918-3240,,CAN ENTOMOL,Can.

Claw measurements were taken, prey size and prey species preference was tested and caloric value of prey was determined. Morphological measurements indicated that all three decapod species had different sized chela relative to body size. In the laboratory, the three predators preferred similar sized mussels and barnacles, and had similar handling times for both of these prey species. None of the three predator species consumed measurable amounts of kelp. Rock crabs and lobsters preferentially selected mussels over barnacles, while green crabs consumed equal amounts of both prey species. The preferred mussel size was smaller than the calculated optimum while the optimal barnacle size was eaten. These results suggest that while green crabs, rock crabs and lobsters have differing claw morphologies, they select similar prey and consume prey at the same rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Since its inception, the GUD approach has been applied successfully to a vast range of foraging species and foraging scenarios. However, its application is not simple, as anyone who has tried to use it for the first time might attest. Limitations of the technique were noted at its conception, yet only the artificiality of the patches, the appropriateness of the food resource, and the possibility of multiple visiting foragers were identified. Here we show the current uses of GUD and outline the practical benefits as well as the often overlooked limitations of the technique. We define seven major points that need to be addressed when applying this methodology: (1) the curvilinearity between harvest rate and energy, (2) the energetic state of the forager, (3) the effect of group foraging, (4) food quality and substrate properties, (5) the predictability of the patch, (6) behavioral traits of the forager, and (7) nontarget species. We also suggest how GUD experiments can be enhanced by incorporating complementary methods (such as cameras) to better understand the foraging processes involved in the GUD itself. We conclude that the benefits of using GUD outweigh the costs, but that its limitations should not be ignored. Incorporating new methods when using GUD can potentially offer novel and important insights into the study of foraging behavior.","[Bedoya-Perez, Miguel A.; Carthey, Alexandra J.

Based on this concept, a field study was conducted on the niche partitioning of three territorial congeneric species of skimmers (Anisoptera: Libellulidae) in Northeast Algeria during the breeding season of 2011. According to their size, there is a descending hierarchy between Orthetrum nitidinerve Selys, O. chrysostigma (Burmeister), and O. coerulescens anceps (Schneider). After being marked and surveyed, the two latter species had the same breeding behavior sequence. Knowing that they had almost the same size, such species could not co-occur in the same habitat according to the competitive exclusion principle. The spatial distribution of the three species was investigated at two different microhabitats, and it was found that these two species were actually isolated at this scale. O. chrysostigma and O. nitidinerve preferred open areas, while O. c. anceps occurred in highly vegetated waters.

In particular, a predictive framework is lacking for when to expect enemies to have independent versus non-independent effects on their host plant. This is problematic for weed biological control programmes where multiple enemies are frequently released with the possibility of antagonistic interactions that may reduce control. Here, we conduct an analysis of 74 unique plant-enemy-enemy combinations from 51 studies to determine the frequency of non-independent effects of natural enemies on host plant performance, and test a number of a priori predictions for determinants of independent and antagonistic effects of multiple enemies. For three-quarters of plant response measurements, enemies had independent effects on plant performance. In most of the remainder, multiple enemies led to less reduction in performance than that predicted from each enemy alone. Antagonistic effects occurred when enemies attacked the same plant part concurrently or attacked plant reproductive structures. These two predictors explained why antagonistic effects were particularly prevalent for weeds, plants in the family Asteraceae and enemies in the order Diptera. Our results suggest that a few simple rules about avoiding particular combinations of multiple enemies could improve biological control success.","[Stephens, Andrea E.

Pollinators are often implicated in the origin of plant species because adaptation to different modes of pollination can drive divergence in floral traits and bring about reproductive isolation. However, very few studies have attempted to answer the next question: 'Can plant species that differ only in their mode of pollination coexist?' Fragmentary evidence supports the idea that intraspecific competition for pollination resources can limit population growth rate, thus allowing the coexistence of species that use different pollinators, or the same pollinators at different times.","Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","Pauw, A (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",apauw@sun.ac.za,"Pauw, Anton/A-6126-2008","Pauw, Anton/0000-0002-4012-648X",,,,75,92,96,1,167,ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",0169-5347,1872-8383,,TRENDS ECOL EVOL,Trends Ecol.

Comparison of resource use at multiple locations with differing resource availability can allow fundamental specialists to be distinguished from species that simply feed predominantly on prey types that are locally abundant. This study investigates geographic variation in the feeding ecology of coral-feeding butterflyfishes to examine whether patterns of resource use and levels of dietary specialisation vary among distinct locations, corresponding with changes in resource availability. Our specific aims were to investigate whether the dietary niche breadth of four butterflyfishes varies among five geographically separated locations and assess whether each species utilises similar resources in each location. Resource availability and dietary composition of four butterflyfishes were quantified at three sites across each of five geographic locations throughout the Pacific. Niche breadth, niche overlap, and resource selection functions were calculated for each species at each site and compared among locations. Availability of dietary resources varied significantly among locations and sites. Chaetodon vagabundus, C. citrinellus and C. lunulatus had low levels of dietary specialisation and used different resources in each location. Chaetodon trifascialis had high levels of dietary specialisation and used the same few resources in each location. Our results indicate that relative levels of dietary specialisation among different butterflyfishes do hold at larger spatial scales, however, geographical variation in the dietary composition of all butterflyfishes indicates that prey availability has a fundamental influence on dietary composition. Highly specialised species such as C. trifascialis will be highly vulnerable to coral loss as they appear to be largely inflexible in their dietary composition. However, the increased feeding plasticity observed here for C. trifascialis suggests this species may have a greater capacity to respond to coral loss than previously assumed.","[Lawton, Rebecca J.; Cole, Andrew J.; Pratchett, Morgan S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Lawton, Rebecca J.; Berumen, Michael L.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia","Lawton, RJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",rebecca.lawton@my.jcu.edu.au,"cole, andrew J/L-5764-2013; Pratchett, Morgan/AAW-5179-2020; Cole, Andrew/G-5220-2011; Berumen, Michael L/F-7745-2011; Lawton, Rebecca/E-5711-2014; Lawton, Rebecca/A-6149-2012; Pratchett, Morgan S/A-9256-2010","Pratchett, Morgan/0000-0002-1862-8459; Berumen, Michael L/0000-0003-2463-2742; Lawton, Rebecca/0000-0001-6296-6415; Pratchett, Morgan S/0000-0002-1862-8459",Queensland Government; Wildlife Preservation Society of Australia; American Australian Association; Lizard Island Research Station (a facility of The Australian Museum); Project Aware; Australian Coral Reef Society,"We thank D.

In Western Europe, several amphibian species have been introduced in recent decades, among them Discoglossus pictus, impact of which in native amphibian communities is still unknown. We studied the potential impact of D. pictus by analysing the degree of niche overlap, assuming the possible existence of competitive interactions with native species. We have studied the structure of the anuran assemblage at local level, defining the morphospace occupied by native species and the habitat occupied by the different ecomorphs. The analysis of distance matrices suggested that there was a covariation between morphological characters and habitat selection. We determined the position of D. pictus within the morphospace of the native anuran community, patterns of co-occurrence among alien, and native species and habitat selection. The potential effect of climate on local assemblages had been controlled based on data obtained from climate models. These analysis showed that D. pictus was clustered with the benthic guild, selected positively small ephemeral ponds and was a thermophilic species. Based on these results, a greater degree of niche overlap was expected with Bufo calamita and Pelodytes punctatus. The definition of morphological groups can be useful to understand the invaded assemblage structure and the potential effect of an alien frog on native communities.","[Escoriza, Daniel; Boix, Dani] Univ Girona, Inst Aquat Ecol, Fac Sci, Girona 17071, Spain; [Escoriza, Daniel; Boix, Dani] Univ Girona, Dept Environm Sci, Fac Sci, Girona 17071, Spain","Escoriza, D (corresponding author), Univ Girona, Inst Aquat Ecol, Fac Sci, Campus Montilivi, Girona 17071, Spain.",daniel_escoriza@hotmail.com,"Boix, Dani/L-5190-2014; Escoriza, Daniel/AAP-9813-2021","Boix, Dani/0000-0001-5468-2236; Escoriza, Daniel/0000-0002-6853-0134",Ministerio de Educacion y CienciaSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [GL2008 05778/BOS],"We want to thank to the Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia, Programa de Investigacion Fundamental which funded the research performed in Spanish territory (ref.

To examine the relative influence of these variables on juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Salmon River drainage (ID, USA), we examined diel differences in foraging microhabitats, behaviour and consumption in two areas with consistent differences in parr-to-smolt survival. In lower Big Creek (LBC, high-survival area) and upper Big Creek (UBC, low-survival area), we observed fish by snorkelling, recording length, behaviour (foraging rate and aggression) and physical (depth, velocity, cover, temperature) and biotic (density, size and species of neighbouring fish) microhabitat features. Stomach contents were extracted to estimate consumption. Depth and temperature were greater in LBC, where Chinook salmon were significantly larger and present at lower densities. Fish in LBC exhibited higher foraging activity during the day than night, but there were no size differences between day and night foragers. In UBC, a higher density area, foraging behaviour did not change between day and night, although the smallest size classes did not forage nocturnally. Regression models that integrated physical and biotic variables suggested that physical factors influenced foraging in both areas, but competition also affected foraging in UBC. Our results demonstrate that fish from low- and high-survival populations in Big Creek are exposed to different physical and biological influences during their first growth season, which are reflected in different diel foraging behaviours.","[Cromwell, Kara J.; Kennedy, Brian P.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Cromwell, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Resources, POB 441136, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",kara.cromwell@vandals.uidaho.edu,,,DeVlieg Foundation; NMFS-NWMF,"We thank three anonymous reviewers whose comments guided many improvements to the original manuscript.

Most studies addressing the causes of the recent increases and expansions of mesopredators in many ecosystems have focused on the top-down, releasing effect of extinctions of large apex predators. However, in the case of the northward expansion of the red fox into the arctic tundra, a bottom-up effect of increased resource availability has been proposed, an effect that can counteract prey shortage in the low phase of the multi-annual rodent cycle. Resource subsidies both with marine and with terrestrial origins could potentially be involved. 2. During different phases of a multi-annual rodent cycle, we investigated the seasonal dynamics and spatial pattern of resource use by red foxes across a coast to inland low arctic tundra gradient, Varanger Peninsula, Norway. We employed two complementary methods of diet analyses: stomach contents and stable isotope analysis. 3. We found that inland red foxes primarily subsisted on reindeer carrions during the low phase of a small rodent population cycle. Lemmings became the most important food item towards the peak phase of the rodent cycle, despite being less abundant than sympatric voles. Isotopic signatures of tissue from both predator and prey also revealed that red foxes near the coast used marine-derived subsidies in the winter, but these allochthonous resources did not spillover to adult foxes living beyond 20-25 km from the coast. 4. Although more needs to be learned about the link between increasing primary productivity due to climatic warming and trophic dynamics in tundra ecosystems, we suggest that changes in reindeer management through a bottom-up effect, at least regionally, may have paved the way towards the establishment of a new mesopredator in the tundra biome.","[Killengreen, Siw T.; Lecomte, Nicolas; Ehrich, Dorothee; Schott, Tino; Yoccoz, Nigel G.; Ims, Rolf A.] Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway","Killengreen, ST (corresponding author), Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",siw.killengreen@uit.no,"Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014; Killengreen, Siw/G-9205-2016; Ehrich, Dorothee/F-6492-2015","Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039; Ehrich, Dorothee/0000-0002-3028-9488; Lecomte, Nicolas/0000-0002-8473-5375",Norwegian Directorate of Nature Management; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission,"We thank the field inspectors from the Norwegian Directorate of Nature Management, I.

Many red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) that reside on federal lands occur on 15 military installations in the southeastern United States. This close association has increased concern over potential conflicts between conservation requirements of endangered species and the military's mission of combat readiness. Our objectives were to 1) determine if military training operations affect behavior, reproductive success, and productivity of red-cockaded woodpeckers; 2) develop a frequency-weighting function to assess woodpecker hearing sensitivity; 3) identify factors that affect woodpecker responses to military training operations; 4) develop distance and dose-response thresholds for quantifying woodpecker responses to noise levels and stimulus distances; 5) characterize military training operations through quantification of sound levels, source identification, distance from active woodpecker nests, frequency spectra, duration, and frequency of occurrence; and 6) document baseline woodpecker nesting behavior. We conducted our study on the Fort Stewart Military Installation located in southeast Georgia, USA. Downy woodpeckers, as surrogates for red-cockaded woodpeckers, had their best hearing sensitivity within the peak range of the power spectrum of both downy and red-cockaded woodpecker vocalizations, which is at a higher frequency than that of a typical passerine. Overall, woodpeckers had a reduced auditory sensitivity relative to human hearing sensitivity and other species of small birds, especially in the frequency range >4 kHz. Woodpeckers were most sensitive in the 1.5- to 4.0-kHz range. Sensitivity appeared to drop off quickly at frequencies <1.0 kHz and >4.0 kHz. Overall, we did not find that the woodpecker-frequency-weighting function we developed provided a better predictor of woodpecker flush response compared with A-weighting. More research is needed to better understand the relationship between frequency-weighting functions and woodpecker response behavior. Potential breeding groups of woodpeckers across the population increased from 158 in 1997 to 181 in 2000, wheras nesting groups increased from 141 in 1998 to 170 in 2000, for overall increases of 14.6% and 20.6%, respectively, over the 3 years of this project. Fledging success rates for individual nests within the overall population remained consistent from 1998 to 2000, averaging 84.4%. Mean clutch sizes for woodpecker groups for 1998 to 2000 ranged from 2.75 to 3.01 eggs/nest, brood size ranged from 2.01 to 2.22 nestlings/nest, whereas the average number of young fledged ranged from 1.57 to 1.76 young/occupied nest. We observed no difference in reproductive success or productivity between experimental and control-tested red-cockaded woodpecker groups. Overall, experimental test groups produced an average of 2.98 eggs/nest, 1.89 nestlings/nest, and 1.54 young/occupied nest from 1999 to 2000, compared with 2.73 eggs/nest, 1.91 nestlings/nest, and 1.57 young/occupied nest at control groups. We measured behavioral responses (nest attendance and arrivals and departures from the nest) of red-cockaded woodpeckers to military training events through direct and indirect (i.e., video surveillance) observation of 464. 5 hours of woodpecker nesting behavior before and after controlled experimental events while recording and characterizing militry-generated sound events using sound-recording equipment. We presented woodpeckers with actual 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators from controlled distances to develop distance and sound thresholds. We used video surveillance to document potential behavioral responses of woodpeckers primarily during nonexperimental military training operations in areas that could not be safely monitored and to determine baseline woodpecker nesting behaviors. We recorded 2,846 nonexperimental military noise events in 157 data sessions at 50 red-cockaded woodpecker groups from 1998 to 2000. We also recorded 206 experimental tests at 58 woodpecker groups during 1999 and 2000. Life-table analyses of flush response time showed that at short ranges (15-30 m) the flush response was stronger for artillery simulator blasts than for blank fire in both the incubation and the nestling phases. In contrast, at medium distances (45-60 m) blank fire tended to produce more flush responses than artillery fire in both incubation and nestling phases. At longer distances (>60 m), blank fire and artillery produced similar flush responses in the incubation phase, whereas flush response was stronger for blank fire than for artillery in the nestling phase. In general, most animals that responded to military activity flushed within 5 seconds of the stimulus event. Woodpeckers returned to nests within an average of 4.4 minutes after being flushed by artillery simulators and 6.3 minutes after 0.50-caliber blank-fire tests. Woodpecker flush response rates increased as stimulus distance decreased and sound levels increased, regardless of stimulus type or year. Woodpeckers did not flush from nests when 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators were >152 m away and sound-exposure levels (decibels [dB]) were <68 dBW (woodpecker-based frequency-weighting curve) and <65 dBW, respectively. We found that blast treatments reduced arrival rates of adults at the nest, with the amount of reduction dependent on the type of blast stimulus and number of helpers at the nest. On the other hand, blast treatments had no detectable effects on nest attendance. The effect of blank fire on incubation-phase arrivals over a 30-minute interval (about 40% reduction) was nearly twice that of artillery simulator fire (about a 20% reduction). There was no evidence supporting any effect of stimulus type on arrivals during the nestling phase. Blast stimuli during incubation reduced arrivals by 40% when no helpers were present, but the strength of this effect decreased to 28% when one helper was present, and was only 6% for nests with >= 2 helpers. Distance of the blast from the nest did not affect the response of arrival rates to blast treatments. Infrequent, short-duration military training exercises, as measured, did not appear to substantially impact red-cockaded woodpecker reproductive success and productivity on the Fort Stewart Military Installation. Our results may be applicable to other military installations where similar training activities and intensity levels occur. Additional research is needed to address possible habituation or sensitization of red-cockaded woodpeckers to human activities in proximity to active nest sites. Although we attempted to monitor woodpecker response to a number of military training activities, other types of military training operations or human-based activities with louder noise, longer duration, incrased human presence, and greater frequency of occurrence could more negatively influence woodpecker nesting behavior and need to be investigated. Our results do not support the hypothesis that military maneuver training operations are limiting factors in the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers on military installations, based on our level and type of testing. Natural resource management policies on military installations have had a positive influence on the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers and probably outweigh the negative effects of typical military training.

Sustainable strategies to manage grasshopper populations through habitat management require knowledge of the forces that regulate grasshopper populations. This experiment was undertaken to determine whether populations of Melanoplus borealis (Fieber), a common pest species in Alaska, are food-limited in Alaska. Cages were set up in a fallow field near Delta Junction, AK, in 3 yr (2007-2009). In 2007 and 2008, fertilizer was added to half the plots to increase primary production, and, in all years, cages within each plot were stocked with 0, 5, 9, or 13 fourth-instar M. borealis ( equivalent to 0, 20, 36, or 52 grasshoppers/m(2)). Grasshoppers in each cage were counted weekly. Near the end of the growing season, surviving female grasshoppers (approximate to 40% of the original number) were collected. Femur length was taken as a measure of adult size, and functional ovarioles were counted as a measure of current fecundity. If the grasshoppers were food limited, we expected to see significant effects of either density or fertilizer on grasshopper survival, size, or fecundity. The fertilizer treatment greatly increased primary production in both years. Neither fertilizer treatment nor grasshopper density had consistent effects on survival, size, or potential fecundity, leading us to conclude that food is seldom limiting to populations in the interior of Alaska at densities <50 m(-2).","[Fielding, Dennis J.] USDA ARS, Subarctic Agr Res Unit, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Zhang, Mingchu] Univ Alaska, Sch Nat Resources & Agr Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA","Fielding, DJ (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Subarctic Agr Res Unit, POB 757200, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",dennis.felding@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,42,11,11,0,7,ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC AMER,LANHAM,"10001 DEREKWOOD LANE, STE 100, LANHAM, MD 20706-4876 USA",0046-225X,,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

We examined processes controlling population dynamics in the purple clam Amiantis purpurata population of Playa Villarino (north of San Matias Gulf, Argentina) at the southernmost limits of its distribution. Population structure at this location has been dominated for more than 2 decades by 3 consecutive cohorts settled in 1978-1980. We used data on mean size and mass, growth rate, area covered by residents, density and biomass collected at 2 sites between 1982 and 2003, and a survey performed in 1995 over the whole population, to explore density dependence. The spatial pattern showed that: (1) whereas density was heterogeneous with highest values at the western side of the ground, biomass was more uniform, and the relationship between biomass and density was non-linear, becoming asymptotic at a density of 200 clams m(-2); (2) body size and density decreased over time; and (3) the substrate area used by clams was less than 35% of the available substrate. Temporal patterns showed that (1) density decreased with time but biomass was almost constant, and (2) growth curves were indicative of a density-dependent effect: individuals at low-density sites grew faster than individuals at high-density sites. Differences were strong between sites and slight (or absent) between cohorts. Natural mortality, which did not differ between cohorts, was estimated by the decrease in density over time as M = 0.126. We propose that the purple clam population is regulated by a compensatory effect whereby losses due to mortality are compensated by increased growth rate, and therefore enhancement of local biomass.","[Morsan, Enrique M.; del Socorro Doldan, Maria] Univ Nacl Comahue, Inst Biol Marina & Pesquera Almirante Storni, RA-8520 San Antonio Oeste, RN, Argentina; [Pappalardo, Paula] Pontificia Univ Catolica, Fac Ciencias Biol, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Pappalardo, Paula] Pontificia Univ Catolica, Estn Costera Invest Marinas, Santiago, Chile","Morsan, EM (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, Inst Biol Marina & Pesquera Almirante Storni, Costanera S-N,CC 104, RA-8520 San Antonio Oeste, RN, Argentina.",qmorsan@gmail.com,,"Pappalardo, Paula/0000-0003-0853-7681",,,,28,7,7,0,7,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Location Andes Mountains of Colombia. Methods We used Maxent, a climate envelope model (CEM), and environmental and geographic information to study range-filling (i.e. the extent to which a species occurs in all the areas in which it is predicted to occur) in 70 range-restricted bird species of the Colombian Andes. Environmental data were taken from the WorldClim database, and species occurrence data were taken from museum data collated by the BioMap project, an observational database, and the literature. We evaluated how climate and geographic barriers may shape range limits at two scales. Results At a broad extent (i.e. across the three main cordilleras within the Colombian Andes), we find that CEMs predict there to be suitable environmental conditions for particular species in regions where the species is absent, possibly as a result of dispersal limitation or biotic interactions. In contrast, at a finer scale (within a given cordillera), species generally occur across the entire area predicted to be suitable by a given CEM. Geographic discontinuities within cordilleras do not generally correspond to range limits; instead, range limits correspond to changes in environmental conditions. Main conclusions Our results suggest that different mechanisms influence the presence of species at different scales. Dispersal limitation, potentially combined with species interactions, may influence range limits at a broad extent (the entire Colombian Andes), while strong environmental gradients correspond to range limits at a finer scale (within a cordillera).","[Graham, Catherine H.; Silva, Natalia; Velasquez-Tibata, Jorge] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11789 USA","Graham, CH (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 650 Life Sci Bldg, Stony Brook, NY 11789 USA.",cgraham@life.bio.sunysb.edu,"Graham, Catherine/A-9560-2011; Graham, Catherine/AAN-1237-2020","Graham, Catherine/0000-0001-9267-7948; Graham, Catherine/0000-0001-9267-7948; Velasquez-Tibata, Jorge/0000-0002-7773-7348",Darwin Initiative UK-DEFRA; Conservation International; Natural History Museum (UK); American Museum of Natural History; Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia,"We would like to thank the following Project BioMap staff and museum curators: Juan Carlos Verhelst, Diana Arzuza, Andrea Morales, Clara I.

Such multispecies interactions can give rise to trait-mediated indirect effects that are likely to be common in nature but which are also inherently difficult to predict. Understanding multispecies interactions is also important in the use of biological control agents to control invasive plants because modern approaches to biocontrol rely on releasing multiple agents for each target weed. Centaurea solstitialis is one of the most problematic invasive weeds in California, USA, and the weevil Eustenopus villosus is its dominant biological control agent. We conducted a field experiment to quantitatively assess the direct effect of the recently approved biocontrol pathogen Puccinia jaceae f.s. solstitialis on plant performance and any indirect effects that might arise by altering the plant's interactions with Eustenopus or its pollinators (principally the nonnative Apis mellifera). We documented both synergy and interference between the two biocontrol agents depending on the life stage of the weevil. Puccinia infection increased the impact of bud-feeding by the adult weevils but reduced the impact of seed-feeding by larval weevils. Neither infection nor Eustenopus attack had an effect on pollinator visitation. The net effect was that attack by both the pathogen and the weevil did not reduce plant fitness relative to plants attacked only by the weevil. Because the consequence to the plant of interacting with one species may depend on the presence or absence of other interacting species, a careful consideration of multispecies interactions may be necessary for the selection of biocontrol agents that act in a complementary manner to reduce plant fitness. Likewise, relatively tractable weed-biocontrol systems allow us to examine multispecies interactions that can be difficult to study experimentally in native systems that are composed of numerous species with well-established populations.","[Swope, Sarah M.; Parker, Ingrid M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Swope, Sarah M.] ARS, USDA, Exot & Invas Weeds Res Unit, Albany, CA 94710 USA","Swope, SM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",swope@biology.ucsc.edu,"Parker, Ingrid M./ABH-2014-2020","Parker, Ingrid M./0000-0002-4847-1827",USDA's Exotic and Invasive Weeds Research Unit; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0808337],"We thank Marci Beitch and Laurel Warddrip for their diligent work in the field.

We hypothesized that the willow's response following herbivory affects the entire arthropod community structure on the tree due to changes in plant quality. To examine this hypothesis, we investigated arthropod communities on three willow species, Salix gilgiana, Salix eriocarpa and Salix serissaefolia. In our common garden, cuttings were established in 2003 and experimental treatments were applied in 2005. Damage by a boring caterpillar of a swift moth (Endoclita excrescens) and artificial cutting of 25% stems were applied as partial herbivory within individual trees, and 100% cutting of stems was applied to represent severe herbivory to whole individual trees. These treatments stimulated lateral shoot production depending on damage intensity, resulting in full compensation for biomass loss. Positive relationships were detected between within-tree variation in foliar nitrogen content and overall abundance/species richness of herbivores. Moth boring and 25% cutting increased herbivore abundance and species richness relative to controls. However, we found no significant differences in herbivore abundance and species richness between 100% cut and control trees. Community composition of herbivore species was significantly different between the following three groups: (i) bored and 25% cut; (ii) 100% cut; and (iii) control trees. Changes in community structure of herbivores were likely due to changes in plant quality depending on the intensity of damage. Although total predator abundance and species richness were not significantly different among treatments, community composition of predator species was significantly different among treatments. These results indicate that herbivore-induced willow responses can largely determine the entire arthropod community structure of multitrophic levels due to changes in plant quality. We suggest that heterogeneous resource conditions induced by herbivory within and among plant individuals increase the species diversity of arthropods.","[Utsumi, Shunsuke; Ohgushi, Takayuki] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Nakamura, Masahiro] Hokkaido Univ, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060, Japan","Utsumi, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",shun@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Utsumi, Shunsuke/0000-0003-1558-8073","COEMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)","The authors thank A.A.

Grasshopper populations respond to interacting extrinsic and intrinsic factors, with yearly and decadal weather patterns and the timing of precipitation all potentially important. The effects of initial and increasing grasshopper densities on grasshopper survival and reproductive correlates were examined at a northern mixed-grass prairie site through manipulations of grasshopper densities inside 10-m(2) cages. High-quality grass growth occurred after a 9.1-cm mid-August rain. Reduced proportional survival was apparent in the two higher density treatments before the rain, indicative of food-limited density-dependent mortality. However, the large late summer rainfall event mediated the effects of exploitative competition on demographic characteristics because of the high-quality vegetation growth. This led to weaker effects of food limitation on survival and reproduction at the end of the experiment. The results indicate a direct link between weather variation, resource quality and grasshopper population dynamics led to a severe grasshopper outbreak and show that infrequent large precipitation events can have significant effects on population dynamics. Additional research is needed to examine the importance of infrequent large precipitation events on grasshopper population dynamics in grassland ecosystems.","USDA ARS, No Plains Agr Res Lab, Sidney, MT 59270 USA","Branson, DH (corresponding author), USDA ARS, No Plains Agr Res Lab, 1500 N Cent Ave, Sidney, MT 59270 USA.",dave.branson@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,63,35,42,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

To identify trophic guilds, we first studied seasonal and annual diets of predators, calculated trophic overlap among species pairs, and then constructed overlap matrices (similarity matrices). We determined guild membership objectively by entering the similarity matrices into the clustering technique unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averaging. Carnivores from both assemblages were grouped, respectively, into four feeding guilds. Lagomorphs and rodents promoted the formation of two feeding guilds in both study sites, although the taxonomic composition of predator species that composed them was different. The ungulates-edentates feeding guild was only present at Santa Cruz, whereas the birds and reptiles feeding guild was only present at Donana. Invertebrates and fruits were the base for the formation of a guild composed by species of the same taxonomic origin both in Santa Cruz and Donana. Guild structure of Santa Cruz and Donana assemblages did not exhibit seasonal or annual variation, although the specific guild composition changed over the two studied periods for both assemblages. This structure probably responded to discontinuities in resource spectra in Santa Cruz and fluctuations in rabbit abundance in Donana. Our results support the hypothesis that establishes that guilds are originated by opportunistic convergence of species on abundant and energetically rewarding resources.","UACO, UNPA, Ctr Invest, RA-9050 Puerto Deseado, Santa Cruz, Argentina; JCCM, UCLM, CSIC, IREC, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain; Estac Biol Donana, CSIC, E-41013 Seville, Spain","Zapata, SC (corresponding author), UACO, UNPA, Ctr Invest, Av Prefectura Naval S-N, RA-9050 Puerto Deseado, Santa Cruz, Argentina.",titinazapata@yahoo.com.ar,"Delibes, Miguel/K-2744-2014; Ferreras, Pablo/A-6017-2009","Delibes, Miguel/0000-0002-3569-567X; Ferreras, Pablo/0000-0002-1116-6706; Travaini, Alejandro/0000-0002-2694-6617",,,,88,22,24,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1612-4642,1439-0574,,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur.

Daphnia pulicaria abundance and size at first reproduction (SFR) declined, while ephippia (resting egg) formation increased at high temperatures. Daphnia mendotae abundance and clutch size increased with predation risk at high temperatures, but produced few ephippia. Thus, each species exhibited phenotypic plasticity, but responded in sharply different ways to the same environmental cues. In Glen Elder reservoir, Kansas USA, D. pulicaria dominance shifted to D. mendotae dominance as temperature and predation risk increased from March to June in both 1999 and 2000.

We conducted a field experiment in western Finland to evaluate the relative roles of these mechanisms in inducing spatial synchrony among cyclic populations of field voles Microtus agrestis. The study was conducted during the increase and peak phases of a vole population cycle on four agricultural field sites situated 1.5-7.0 km apart. Each field contained two 0.5-ha fenced enclosures and one 1-ha unfenced control area. One enclosure per field allowed access by small mustelid predators and the other by avian predators; all enclosures prevented the dispersal of voles. The unfenced control areas allowed access by all predators as well as dispersal by voles. Enclosed vole populations were in a treatment-wise asynchronous phase before the predator access treatments were applied. The growth rates of all enclosed populations were tightly synchronized during the course of the experiment. Conversely, synchrony both among the unfenced populations and between the fenced and unfenced populations was practically non-existent. During winter, in the increase phase of the cycle, vole populations in all treatments declined to low densities due to a seasonal effect of winter food depletion. During summer, in the peak year of the vole cycle, all populations fluctuated in synchrony. At this time, both small mustelids and birds of prey appeared to be abundant enough to induce synchrony. Dispersal was identified as a potential contributor to synchronization, but the magnitude of its effects could not be reliably discerned. Our results indicate that no single mechanism can account for the observed patterns of spatial synchrony among cyclic northern vole populations. Rather, spatial synchronization is induced by different mechanisms, namely seasonality and predation, acting successively during different seasons and phases of the vole cycle.","Turku Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland","Huitu, O (corresponding author), Turku Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.",ohuitu@utu.fi,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043",,,,83,25,26,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,2005,109,3,,,,,583,593,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13476.x,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,907MO,WOS:000227722400017,,,,,2021-09-21,

We indicate as behavioral adaptation a mechanism, based on a kind of learning, which is not viewed in the evolutionary sense but is intended to occur over shorter time scales. We consider a competitive adaptive n species Lotka-Volterra system, n >= 3, in which one species is made ecologically differentiated with respect to the others by carrying capacity and intrinsic growth rate. The symmetry properties of the system and the existence of a certain class of invariant subspaces allow the introduction of a 7-dimensional reduced model, where n appears as a parameter, which gives full account of existence and stability of equilibria in the complete system. The reduced model is effective also in describing the time-dependent regimes for a large range of parameter values. The case in which one species has a strong ecological advantage (i.e. with a carrying capacity higher than the others), but with a varying growth rate, has been analyzed in detail, and time-dependent behaviors have been investigated in the case of adaptive competition among four species. Relevant questions, as species survival/exclusion, are addressed focusing on the role of adaptation. Interesting forms of species coexistence are found (i.e. competitive stable equilibria, periodic oscillations, strange attractors). (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the potential for species coexistence occurring at local or regional spatial scales, trade-offs are typically approached at a single scale. In recent years, ecologists have increasingly provided evidence for the importance of community processes at both local and regional spatial scales. This review summarizes the theoretical predictions for the traits associated with trade-offs under different conditions and at different spatial scales. We provide a spatial framework for understanding trade-offs, coexistence and the supportive empirical evidence. Predictions are presented that link the patterns of diversity observed to the patterns of trade-offs that lead to coexistence at different spatial scales. Recent evidence for the evolution of trade-offs under different conditions is provided which explores both laboratory microcosm studies and phylogenetic tests. Examining trade-offs within a spatial framework can provide a strong approach to understanding community structure and dynamics, while explaining patterns of species diversity.","Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Kneitel, JM (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Campus Box 1137, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",kneitel@biology2.wustl.edu,,"Kneitel, Jamie/0000-0002-7841-1198",,,,166,516,531,13,353,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Repetition of experiments in space and time provides an estimate of this variability at specific scales, but does not explain how changes in variance generate structure in assemblages and the extent to which variance and mean intensity interact. This paper seeks to identify suitable procedures for empirical analyses on the influence of variance and mean intensity of predictor ecological variables on spatial and temporal patterns in natural populations. A survey of the ecological literature indicates that temporal variability in studies of disturbance and in analyses of consumer-resource interactions is generally expressed in terms of frequency of events. This is inappropriate, as frequency confounds the variance with the mean effect size of a process. A possible solution to the problem involves experimental designs in which levels of intensity and those of variability are chosen independently over explicit spatial or temporal scales and treated as fixed, orthogonal factors. Examples are offered for various scenarios of consumer-resource interactions along with indications for statistical tests of hypotheses. Such novel approaches have important ramifications for understanding variability in a wide range of ecological contexts and for predicting the response of assemblages to increased environmental fluctuations, including those expected under modified climate conditions.","Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Uomo & Ambiente, I-56126 Pisa, Italy","Benedetti-Cecchi, L (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Uomo & Ambiente, Via A Volta 6, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.",bencecc@discuit.unipi.it,"Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro/J-8225-2019; Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012","Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro/0000-0001-5244-5202; ",,,,75,144,147,2,84,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,SEP,2003,84,9,,,,,2335,2346,,10.1890/02-8011,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,719VQ,WOS:000185226100010,,,,,2021-09-21,

Ontogenetic niche shifts introduce stage structure in a population with different stages interacting with different communities and can substantially affect their dynamics. In this article, I use mathematical models to test the hypothesis that adaptive plasticity in the timing of ontogenetic niche shifts has a stabilizing effect on consumer-resource dynamics. Adaptive plasticity allows consumers in one ontogenetic niche to perform an early shift to the next ontogenetic niche if the resource density of the first niche is low. The early shift will reduce predation by the consumer on the scarce resource. On the other hand, adaptive plasticity allows consumers to delay their shift to the next niche if the resource density of the first niche is high. The delayed shift will increase the predation on the abundant resource. As a result, the scarce resource will tend to increase, and the abundant resource will tend to decrease. This causes density-dependent negative feedback in the resource dynamics, which stabilizes the consumer-resource dynamics. To test this hypothesis, I compare three consumer-resource models differing in terms of mechanisms controlling the timing of the ontogenetic niche shift: the fixed-age model assumes that the age at which the ontogenetic niche shift occurs is fixed; the fixed-size model assumes that the size at the shift is fixed; and the adaptive plasticity model assumes that the timing of the shift is such that the individual fitness of the consumer is maximized. I show that only the adaptive plasticity model has a locally stable equilibrium and that the stabilizing effect is due to the density-dependent negative feedback in the resource dynamics. I discuss the ontogenetic niche shifts of lake fish in light of the obtained result.","Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan","Takimoto, G (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, POB 20815, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",gaku.takimoto@yale.edu,,,,,,91,33,35,1,20,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

Shallow rock pools can dry out and be refilled repeatedly during a summer causing high mortality of immatures. In deeper pools, young nymphs face intense competition by older stages including cannibalism. The adult corixids move frequently between rock pools and are thus able to use currently available habitat for reproduction. In this dispersal behaviour, the ability to assess the local population density and hence select the more suitable low density patches would be advantageous. We studied the effect of local population density on the frequency of dispersive flights of Arctocorisa carinata (Sahlberg) and Callicorixa producta (Reuter) experimentally, using rock pools from which nymphs of both species were removed. The dispersal rates of marked C. producta adults were significantly lower from experimental rock pools than from normal density controls, leading to a concentration of C. producta adults in the experimental rock pools. Indications of immigration rate differences between the experimental and control pools were also observed.

Although both seastars have similar size structures and generally overlapped in their spatial and temporal distribution, the degree of overlap varied in different sites and appeared to be related to prey abundance, substratum type and slope. Three general patterns were observed: (1) both species aggregating in shallow water and decreasing in numbers with depth; (2) the two species showing inverse depth distributions; and (3) both seastars occurring in low numbers across the subtidal zone. Temporal changes in availability of the preferred prey of the two seastars, the mussel Mytilus edulis, appeared to be a major factor affecting their abundance and distribution. The two seastars occurred together in dense aggregations on mussel beds in shallow water. They consume similar-sized mussels until the number of mussels becomes reduced when A. vulgaris, but not L. polaris, begins to select larger mussels. Once a mussel bed is decimated, the seastars appear to move away, possibly in search of other beds. Intensive seastar foraging limits the distribution of mussels to a few metres in depth. Below the mussel zone, the two seastars are spatially segregated at a small spatial scale (l m(2) quadrat) and select different alternative prey, L. polaris feeding mainly on the crevice-dwelling clam Hiatella arctica and A. vulgaris on the ophiuroid Ophiopholis aculeata. The size partitioning of the preferred prey in shallow water, and spatial segregation and selection of different alternative prey at greater depths may reflect mechanisms permitting the two seastars to coexist.","Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Univ Laval, GIROQ, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada","Gaymer, CF (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833",,,,81,55,58,2,42,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4221 USA",0025-3154,,,J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK,J.

Arthropods were most abundant in the upper parts of the canopy and on the surface of ground vegetation. Sparrowhawks were seen attacking parids only in the upper parts of the canopy. The lowest parts of the pines were safer and this was confirmed by the anti-predatory vigilance of the birds. Crested Tits, top-ranking individuals in the mixed flocks, tended to be frequent ground feeders under snow-free conditions, which was not the case under snowy conditions suggesting the importance of snow cover. Although the lowest parts of trees was the poorest site in terms of arthropod abundance, dominant individuals of the Crested Tit remained there under snowy conditions. Foraging height of alpha individuals of the Willow Tit did not differ from one climate condition to the other. Subordinate Willow and Crested Tits, by contrast, significantly increased their foraging heights. Although subordinate Willow Tits foraged in the highest canopy parts, however, their survival rates did not differ from those of higher-ranked Willow Tits. The results suggest that foraging in the most vulnerable tree parts may not be always linked to the decreased survival. The observed shift of subordinate Willow Tits supposedly made their anti-predatory vigilance more effective, suggesting a possible trade-off between concealment and visibility.","Daugavpils Pedag Univ, Dept Sci, LV-5400 Daugavpils, Latvia; Daugavpils Pedag Univ, Dept Psychol, LV-5400 Daugavpils, Latvia; Daugavpils Pedag Univ, Ecol Lab, LV-5400 Daugavpils, Latvia","Krams, IA (corresponding author), Daugavpils Pedag Univ, Dept Sci, LV-5400 Daugavpils, Latvia.",,"Krams, Indrikis/B-5788-2017","Krams, Indrikis/0000-0001-7150-4108",,,,46,13,13,0,23,FINNISH ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC,HELSINKI,"PO BOX 17 P RAUTATIEKATU 13,, FIN-00014 HELSINKI, FINLAND",0030-5685,,,ORNIS FENNICA,Ornis Fenn.,,2001,78,1,,,,,1,11,,,,,11,Ornithology,Zoology,417AH,WOS:000167812700001,,,,,2021-09-21,

We examined behavioral interactions between two coexisting, migratory wood warblers that competitively interact on breeding territories in central Arizona, USA. The larger Orange-crowned Warbler (Vermivora celata) is aggressive toward the later-arriving Virginia's Warbler (V. virginiae) and responds to playback of Virginia's Warbler songs by approaching the playback speaker or by singing over Virginia's Warbler songs. Virginia's Warblers retreat from interactions with Orange-crowned Warblers and avoid the playback speaker when presented with Orange-crowned Warbler songs. Responses of both species to song playback of the opposite species differed from responses to conspecific songs, indicating that behavioral interactions do not result from misdirected intraspecific aggression. Behavioral responses were consistent with observed ecological interactions between the two species and suggest that asymmetrical behavioral aggression by the dominant Orange-crowned Warbler may be an important mechanism for competitive interactions involving nest sites. These results support previous studies that have used behavioral experiments to infer ecological interactions among coexisting species. While Orange-crowned Warblers may benefit from aggressively excluding Virginia's Warblers from preferred nest sites, limited data on Virginia's Warbler settlement patterns suggest that Virginia's Warblers do not avoid settling on Orange-crowned Warbler territories. Similar reproductive success in sympatric vs, allopatric habitats suggests little consequence for Virginia's Warblers settling with Orange-crowned Warblers, despite increased reproductive success of Virginia's Warblers in sympatric habitat when Orange-crowned Warblers were experimentally removed.","Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div,Avian Studies Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Martin, PR (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Montana Cooperat Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div,Avian Studies Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",,"Martin, Thomas E/F-6016-2011","Martin, Thomas E/0000-0002-4028-4867",,,,43,81,83,1,41,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2001,82,1,,,,,207,218,,10.2307/2680097,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,393UN,WOS:000166488200017,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

Owing to the elastic response of the weeds to an increasing development lead of the sugar beets, the yield losses of the latter were primarily determined by the density and time of appearance of the weeds. For this reason, a forecast of the harmful effects based solely on the weed density is not possible in sugar beets. However, the combination of weed density and the stage of sugar beet development, in which the weeds sprout, offers the possibility of forecasting sugar beet yield losses. The degree of weed coverage and the relative degree of weed coverage adequately reflected at a given evaluation point the effect of the time of appearance on the occupancy-loss relationships of C. album or C. recutita when the plants had sprouted between the two-leaf and nine-leaf stages. However, when the weeds were powerfully suppressed by the beets, as in the case of C. album sprouted in the 10-13-leaf stage, the loss relationship clearly diverged. The degree of weed coverage was nor suitable as the sole parameter for forecasting the harmful effects because the occupancy-loss relationships depended very much on the time of evaluation. However, the differences in the occupancy-loss relationships at different evaluation dates were substantially reduced in C. album, and almost completely eliminated in C. recutita, by resort to the relative degree of weed coverage. However. application of the latter for forecasting the harm to sugar beets is probably useful only in the case of uncompetitive weeds and with herbicides which allow later deployment in respect of the weed development stage than those currently available. Although the technical quality of sugar beets was affected in part by weed competition, this aspect may be disregarded in loss forecasting.","Bayer AG, Landwirtschaftszentrum Monheim, D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany; Inst Zuckerrubenforsch, D-37079 Gottingen, Germany","Wellmann, A (corresponding author), Bayer AG, Landwirtschaftszentrum Monheim, D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany.",,,,,,,55,7,7,0,2,VERLAG DR ALBERT BARTENS,BERLIN 38,"LUCKHOFFSTRASSE 16, D-14129 BERLIN 38, GERMANY",0344-8657,,,ZUCKERINDUSTRIE,Zuckerindustrie,SEP,2000,125,9,,,,,702,714,,,,,13,Food Science & Technology,Food Science & Technology,363BG,WOS:000089813400012,,,,,2021-09-21,

During this study, a drought occurred distinguishing two periods before and after the drought that differed markedly in availability of resources and fish biomass. In this study, differences in resource use between the two periods are presented together with their consequence on the partitioning of resources. A different approach is introduced into the calculation of niche breadth and niche overlap incorporating size-specific differences in resource use and interactions between resource dimensions. Comparison with conventional measures of niche breadth and niche overlap shows that conventional measures often misrepresent interactions between species. Condition and biomass were used as indicators of a species' fitness, and it is shown that fitness of most species is governed by the availability of resources and partitioning of these resources is an important mechanism allowing potential competitors to coexist.

Survey results indicated that wood frogs bred in both open- and closed-canopy ponds, whereas leopard frogs and toads did not, We conducted two experiments in 1.5-m(2) cages set in natural ponds to evaluate species' performance in open- and closed-canopy ponds, The first experiment was conducted in two open-canopy and two closed-canopy ponds and demonstrated that tadpole growth and survivorship for all three species were higher in open-canopy ponds, Wood frogs, however, also grew and survived well in closed-canopy ponds, whereas performance of leopard frogs and toads was very poor in closed-canopy ponds, Competition between species was asymmetrical; wood frogs affected leopard frogs, but the reverse effect was negligible. The second experiment was conducted in the two closed-canopy ponds with wood frog and leopard frog and indicated that food supplementation dramatically increased both survivorship and growth rate of leopard frogs, There was no effect of food addition on wood frog survivorship and a minimal effect on growth rate, Resource differences between open- and closed-canopy ponds therefore appear to have a strong influence on distributions of these species, Dissolved oxygen concentrations also were lower in closed- than in open-canopy ponds, which may interact with resource levels to influence species performance, Finally, we note the potentially widespread and important influence of forest and pond succession on the distribution of amphibian species.","Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Werner, EE (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,41,179,189,0,32,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS HERPETOLOGISTS,CHARLESTON,"UNIV CHARLESTON, GRICE MARINE LABORATORY, 205 FORT JOHNSON RD, CHARLESTON, SC 29412 USA",0045-8511,,,COPEIA,Copeia,FEB 5,1999,,1,,,,,1,12,,10.2307/1447379,,,12,Zoology,Zoology,167TY,WOS:000078650400001,,,,,2021-09-21,

This species is harvested commercially. Shell length and age data were collected for this species from 1980 to 1994 during surveys of population size and structure. These data were used to examine the relationship between the growth rate of S. solidissina and intraspecific density. The null hypothesis was that density (represented by number of individuals per tow) would have no effect on rate of growth. A negative relationship would support the alternative hypothesis, that intraspecific competition had taken place. This analysis focused on the surfclam population offshore from the Delmarva Peninsula, USA because: (1) a major recruitment event occurred in 1977, (2) clam fishermen had reported stunted surfclams in that area, (3) a wide range of local densities were available to examine, and (4) the existence of a closed area within the study area set up an interesting contrast with areas left open to harvesting. Maps of surfclam abundance across the Delmarva region demonstrate that areas of highest density have generally remained in the same location through time. The results suggested that intraspecific competition has been important in structuring this population. Based on data from 1980 to 1992, shell length was significantly reduced at high density, and a significant interaction between age and density was observed. Growth modeling indicated decreased asymptotic lengths and growth rates with increasing density. In nine out of ten pairwise randomization tests, fitted von Bertalanffy growth curves, representing different densities, were significantly different from each other. High densities of clams have persisted in the area that was closed to harvesting for 11 years (1980 to 1991). In 1994, length at age was significantly less in this closed area compared to that in the surrounding area. This effect was apparent in clams from 3 to 17 years of age, and most pronounced in the cohort that recruited to the Delmarva region in high numbers in 1977. Lower growth rates within the closed area have management implications for the optimal duration of closures.","Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Populat Dynam Branch, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Weinberg, JR (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Populat Dynam Branch, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",,,,,,,53,42,43,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Body reserves of Willow Tits as subordinate flock members were found to be dependent on the presence of dominant Crested Tits. At dusk, Willow Tits were heavier than Crested Tits. Body reserves of members of mixed-species flocks negatively correlated with dominance rank within both intraspecific and interspecific hierarchies. Removal experiments confirmed results of field observations, revealing a causal relationship between rank and ability to choose the safest fattening strategy. Body mass and fat reserves of Willow Tit alpha males decreased in the absence of Crested Tits. In contrast, body mass and fatness of dominant individuals of Crested Tits remained at the same level. To control for changes in body mass resulting from a higher rank and smaller flocks, the foraging height of remaining individuals of both species was recorded. Willow Tits responded to removal of Costed Tits by foraging closer to the top of the tree. No shifts were observed in groups with only Crested Tits. Fattening strategies dependent on social status represent a flocking cost to individuals belonging to a subordinate species. Further investigations should be done into the benefits of mixed-species flocking, which is a social behaviour common in parids.","Daugavpils Pedagog Univ, Dept Sci, LV-5407 Daugavpils, Latvia","Krams, I (corresponding author), Daugavpils Pedagog Univ, Dept Sci, LV-5407 Daugavpils, Latvia.",root@maknia.latg.lv,"Krams, Indrikis/B-5788-2017","Krams, Indrikis/0000-0001-7150-4108",,,,45,26,26,1,9,BIRDLIFE FINLAND,HELSINKI,"PO BOX 1285, HELSINKI, 00101, FINLAND",0030-5685,,,ORNIS FENNICA,Ornis Fenn.,,1998,75,1,,,,,19,26,,,,,8,Ornithology,Zoology,ZH886,WOS:000073157300002,,,,,2021-09-21,

Some of these difficulties are due to a failure to recognize the necessary conditions for community patterns to develop, which are largely controlled by the dynamic characteristics of individual species. In continental bird communities - examples of which are considered here - these necessary conditions often will not be met owing to the mobility of most species. Here I document the degrees to which the large-scale dynamics (over hundreds of km) of individual bird species are expressed in community terms in five forest-habitat types throughout the year. These data demonstrate that continental bird communities are so dynamic that the conditions for the development of definite structure are unlikely to be met in either proximate or evolutionary time.

We compare the life histories of three subtidal hermit crabs in Nantucket Harbor, Massachusetts: Pagurus annulipes, P. longicarpus, and P. pollicaris. Specifically, we examine seasonal patterns of reproduction in females, male and female size structure, reproductive effort, and temporal patterns of larval abundance. We also compare shell size among the three species. Life-history features vary with size among the three species. The smallest species (P. annulipes) reproduce soon after metamorphosis and have a high reproductive effort. The two larger species (P. longicarpus and P. pollicaris) delayed reproduction to an intermediate size, and have lower reproductive efforts than P. annulipes. There is no effect of body size on reproduction in P. annulipes, but there is a strong positive effect in P. longicarpus and P. pollicaris. Seasonal patterns of early stage larvae correlated with seasonal patterns of ovigery in all three species, with highest larval densities sampled in P. annulipes and P. longicarpus. Size differences among species were related to patterns of shell usage. Male and female P. annulipes were always found in large shells relative to body size. In comparison, male and female P. longicarpus and P. pollicaris were found in small shells compared to body size. We suggest that early maturity and high reproductive effort have evolved in response to a high risk of mortality associated with small shells. Delayed maturity and low reproductive effort are favored in species that reach a size refuge from shell-crushing predators. Effects of shell limitation are more likely to be common in large species and may also be an important selective in shaping hermit crab life histories.","UNIV MASSACHUSETTS,DEPT BIOL,BOSTON,MA 02125",,,,,,,,35,31,33,0,7,MARINE BIOL LAB,WOODS HOLE,"BIOLOGICAL BULL MBL STREET, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543",0006-3185,,,BIOL BULL,Biol.

Summer declines in deposit feeding populations have been ascribed to food limitation and to the seasonal influx of predators. We used a bioassay approach to test the following hypotheses: (1) Sediment supports more population growth in the spring and early summer, relative to the late summer and fall. (2) The nutritive value of sediment declines from spring to early fall, and absorption therefore should decrease. Laboratory tests using the common deposit feeding oligochaete Paranais litoralis partially support both hypotheses. Population growth studies of spring and summer sediment show a relatively nutritionally enriched surface sediment layer, suggesting that the sediment is recharged in the late fall and winter, either by particulate organic matter deposition or microbial transformation of previously unabsorbable material. High summer temperature contributes to the negative effect of poor sediment quality. In Flax Pond, Long Island, New York, field studies show summer declines of several species of deposit feeding invertebrates, but caging studies demonstrate that predation is not a likely cause of the crashes, which proceed at similar rates inside and outside of cages.","SUNY, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUT, STONY BROOK, NY 11794 USA",,,,,,,,63,52,53,0,5,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Interaction chains result from linked direct interactions between species pairs. Interaction modifications, emergent effects of a multispecies assemblage, result when a third species changes how a pair of other species interacts. Experiments and patterns of abundance in the upper zone of a rocky intertidal community provide examples of both types of indirect effects. By consuming limpets (Lottia digitalis), bird predators indirectly enhance acorn barnacle (Balanus glandula) abundance on horizontal rock benches because limpets dislodge or inadvertently consume young acorn barnacles, an example of an interaction chain. Because L. digitalis has a light-colored shell that is similar in color to barnacle shells, barnacles alter the bird-limpet interaction by changing the ability of birds to find limpets, an example of an interaction modification. Distinguishing between interaction chains and interaction modifications is important because interaction chains can be predicted with only a knowledge of pairwise species interactions while descriptions of interaction modifications require a knowledge of all species combinations involved, precluding a priori prediction. By classifying empirically determined indirect effects, the degree to which indirect effects can be predicted from a knowledge of pairwise interactions can be determined, and the mechanisms that cause interaction modifications can be identified to aid in future prediction.","UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT ZOOL, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA",,,"Wootton, J.

Neither late species had an effect on O. taurinus (the early species).

An important potential consequence of adaptive behavioral responses is higher-order interactions among species (e.g., in which the presence of a third species qualitatively alters the nature of the interaction between two other species). To illustrate this potential, I examine two broad classes of adaptive behavioral responses, choice of activity level and of habitat. I review evidence that suggests that in many organisms these behaviors are mediated by trade-offs between resource acquisition and mortality risk. This trade-off provides a conceptual foundation on which to predict individual behavior, and since the trade-off changes with size, marked behavioral allometries may occur over an individual's ontogeny. I present evidence that these sorts of behavioral responses create strong higher-order interactions. I argue that theory at the individual behavioral level affords the opportunity for a rich interaction between theory at the individual and population levels by providing a mechanistic basis for species interaction theory. Because behavioral responses are occurring on the same time scale as direct effects, ecologists will need explicitly to include adaptive behavioral mechanisms in the theory to understand species interactions in many systems.

Perch 2 and ruffe (for all age classes) consumed insects larvae and pupae. Some individuals of P. fluviatilis greater-than-or-equal-to 2+ were piscivorous and cannibalistic.

The sheer number of potential interaction modifications in ecological systems poses a considerable challenge, making prioritisation for empirical study essential. Here, we introduce measures to quantify the topological relationship of individual interaction modifications relative to the underlying network. We use these, together with measures for the strength of trophic interaction modifications, to identify features of modifications that are most likely to exert significant effects on the dynamics of whole systems. Using a set of simulated food webs and randomly distributed interaction modifications, we test whether a subset of interaction modifications important for the local stability and direction of species responses to perturbation of complex networks can be identified. We show that trophic interaction modifications have particular importance for dynamics when they affect interactions with a high biomass flux, connect species otherwise distantly linked, and where high trophic-level species modify interactions lower in the food web. In contrast, the centrality of modifications in the network provided little information. This work demonstrates that analyses of interaction modifications can be tractable at the network scale and highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between the distributions of trophic and non-trophic effects.","[Terry, J.

Lizards have much lower extinction rates than spiders, even for the same population sizes. Spiders naturally and experimentally become extinct more frequently in the presence than absence of lizards; islands with lizards have fewer spider species than no-lizard islands. The larger the island area, and (for no-lizard islands) the nearer to a potential source, the lower the extinction rate of spider species; both can be related to a tendency for smaller populations to become extinct more readily. Within particular spider species, population time series with higher variabilities in population size tend to have lower extinction rates. Mean population size of a series is positively correlated with temporal variability and negatively correlated with extinction rate; even when these correlations are taken into account in multiple regression, however, a negative relation of temporal variability and extinction rate often exists. A conceptual scheme including immigration and catastrophic mortality, in addition to normal stochastic birth and death rates, appears to accord at least qualitatively with these results. Insular spider populations in the Bahamas appear much closer to a BOORMAN-LEVITT metapopulation than to a LEVINS metapopulation, a similarity that seems to hold for organisms in general.

Simplification and faster simulations would increase their use. Here, a step-by-step methodology was developed and applied to partially metamodel, hence accelerate, the mechanistic model FLORSYS. This is a process-based, multiannual and multispecies model (virtual field) which simulates crop growth and weed dynamics and allows users to assess cropping systems for crop production and biodiversity. The model is relatively slow, which makes it difficult to test numerous and diverse cropping systems needed to identify those reconciling crop production and biodiversity. Here, we (1) identified the slowest submodel of FLORSYS, i.e. the 3D voxelized light interception submodel, (2) identified and applied a relevant methodology to metamodel this submodel in the simplest situation, i.e. we predicted light interception and absorption directly at the scale of the plant instead of the voxel for a single plant in a field, and (3) extrapolated the method to more complex situations, i.e. a plant in diverse and heterogeneous crop:weed canopies, (4) replaced the original process-based FLORSYS submodel by the metamodels, which required additional equations and decision rules, (5) evaluated the metamodelled FLORSYS with independent field observations, showing an adequate prediction quality combined with an increased speed at fine-grained scale since the metamodelled version was 28 times faster than the process-based version. For steps 2 and 3, we used the global sensitivity method based on a truncated Legendre polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) whose coefficients were estimated by Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression to simultaneously (i) rank inputs with respect to their polynomial and total effects on outputs via the so-called PCEPLS sensitivity indices, and (ii) provide metamodels predicting light interception and absorption at the plant level. These metamodels were then shortened into parsimonious metamodels via a LASSO-PLS method. The study showed that there was a trade-off between speed gain due to the metamodelled 3D light submodel and the speed loss due to the additional functions for neighbourhood effects. The metamodelled version is best used for testing complex systems where plant location must be modelled precisley (e.g., precision agriculture, intercropping with precision sowing) whereas the voxelized version with a large voxel size is better for simpler cropping systems. The present step-by-step process may be helpful for investigating and speeding up other complex simulation models with interacting objects/agents. It notably uses a hybrid approach, using a process-based (albeit simplified) approach for the most sensitive plant stage (newly emerged tiny plants) and separate sampling plans and metamodels to ensure that the more sensitive stages/components are adequately covered (small plants).","[Colas, Floriane; Villerd, Jean; Colbach, Nathalie] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Univ Bourgogne, INRAE, AgroSup Dijon,Agroecol, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Gauchi, Jean-Pierre] Univ Paris Saclay, INRAE, MaIAGE, F-78350 Jouy En Josas, France; [Villerd, Jean] Univ Lorraine, INRAE, LAE, F-54500 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France","Colbach, N (corresponding author), INRAE, UMR Agroecol, 17 Rue Sully,BP 86510, F-21065 Dijon, France.",nathalie.colbach@inrae.fr,,,INRAE (EA division); French project CoSAC [ANR-14-CE18-0007]; Burgundy RegionRegion Bourgogne-Franche-Comte; INRAE (MIA division),"The present work was funded by INRAE (EA and MIA divisions) , the French project CoSAC (ANR-14-CE18-0007) and the Burgundy Region.

Designing intercropping systems requires the integration of plant species trait selection with choice of crop configuration and management. Crop growth models can facilitate the understanding and prediction of the interactions between plant traits, crop configuration and management. However, currently no existing crop growth model has been calibrated and tested for cereal-legume intercrops throughout Europea. We calibrated the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) for pure cultures of wheat and faba bean using data from Dutch field trials, and determined the phenological parameters to simulate pure cultures and intercrops from seven field experiments across Europe. APSIM successfully reproduced aboveground dry matters and, for wheat only, grain yields in pure cultures. In intercrops, APSIM systematically overestimated the aboveground dry matter and grain yield of faba bean and underestimated those of wheat. APSIM was reasonably capable of simulating plant heights in pure cultures, but respectively overestimated and underestimated the height of faba bean and wheat in intercrops. In order to simulate wheat-faba bean intercrops better, APSIM should be improved regarding the calculation of biomass partitioning to grains in faba bean and of height growth in both species.","[Berghuijs, Herman N.

We use otolith microstructure analysis to study the life history of 2 widespread and abundant Caribbean reef fishes, genetically identified here as the glass goby Coryphopterus hyalinus and masked goby C. personatus. Our analysis reveals that these species exhibit an extreme life history relative to other vertebrates due to their short lifespan, small adult body size, early maturity, and continuous growth in body length throughout reproductive age. We find that pelagic larval duration (PLD) varies widely, and average larval growth influences PLD where faster-growing larvae have shorter PLDs. We show that average daily growth substantially decreases during the settlement transition to reef habitat, approximately coinciding with reproductive maturity. Continuous somatic growth throughout reproductive age can serve to support greater fecundity in older, larger-bodied females and enhance survivorship. Several features of the ecology (i.e. broad depth range, planktivorous diet) and life history (i.e. small adult body size, quick generational turnover, short lifespan) of C. hyalinus and C. personatus indicate that they play a key trophic role in transferring nutrients from pelagic plankton to Caribbean reef predators and the reef benthos. Our analyses highlight why life history traits related to survival, reproduction, and population dynamics can enhance our understanding of ecosystem-scale processes and functioning on coral reefs.","[Beeken, Nicolette S.; Selwyn, Jason D.; Hogan, J.

However, considering individual variation over short timescales can help us better understand the interaction between invaders and native species. We compared trophic traits of the non-native guppy (Poecilia reticulata) and the native Brazilian poeciliid Phalloceros harpagos using experiments simulating the early stages of an invasive process. We used short-term mesocosms to simulate an early invasion scenario, where the two species were placed together, and a pre-invasion scenario, where species were kept separated, and analyzed interspecific and intraspecific trophic variability. We also compared the foraging efficiency of species in laboratory experiments. We found no differences on the mean diet of both species between pre and early invasion treatments. At the individual level, in the early invasion scenario, individuals of both species reduced their trophic niche as a probable effect of the presence of the heterospecific. Phalloceros harpagos had higher consumption rates than guppies indicating greater efficiency in feeding on invertebrates. Our results suggest that non-native species were not intrinsically better consumers of high-quality resources. Instead, intraspecific variation might be playing an overlooked role in shaping interactions between species during the early stages of invasion.","[Amaral, Jeferson R.; Manna, Luisa R.; Mazzoni, Rosana; Neres-Lima, Vinicius; Marques, Piata S.; Zandona, Eugenia] Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Evolucao, Rua Sao Francisco Xavier 524, BR-20550013 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [El-Sabaawi, Rana W.] Univ Victoria, Dept Biol, Cunningham Bldg 202, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada","Zandona, E (corresponding author), Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Evolucao, Rua Sao Francisco Xavier 524, BR-20550013 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",eugenia.zandona@gmail.com,"Zandona, Eugenia/ABG-8207-2020; Neres-Lima, Vinicius/S-9152-2016","Zandona, Eugenia/0000-0003-4754-5326; Neres-Lima, Vinicius/0000-0003-3802-3438; Amaral, Jeferson Ribeiro/0000-0002-4454-1066","Prociencia UERJ [FAPERJ/CNE/E-26-202.762/2018, CNPq/Pq1D-301463/2017-4, FAPERJ JCNE E-26/203.213/2017, CNPq/Pq2-308261/2017-8]; CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [PrInt 88887.369182/2019-00, 001];  [FAPERJ E-26/202.782/2016];  [E-26/202.783/2016]","We thank field assistants from the Stream Ecology and Fish Ecology labs at the State University of Rio de Janeiro.

With warming temperatures, lake ecosystems in the Arctic are predicted to change in terms of hydrologic flow, water levels, and connectivity with other lakes. We surveyed lakes in northern Alaska to understand how shifts in the distribution or availability of fish may affect the occupancy and breeding success of Pacific (Gavia pacifica) and Yellow-billed Loons (G. adamsii). We then modeled the influence of the presence and abundance of five fish species and the physical characteristics of lakes (e.g., hydrologic connectivity) on loon lake occupancy and chick production. The presence of Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis) had a positive influence on Pacific Loon occupancy and chick production, which suggests that small-bodied fish species provide important prey for loon chicks. No characteristics of fish species abundance affected Yellow-billed Loon lake occupancy. Instead, Yellow-billed Loon occupancy was influenced by the physical characteristics of lakes that contribute to persistent fish populations, such as the size of the lake and the proportion of the lake that remained unfrozen over winter. Neither of these variables, however, influenced chick production. The probability of an unoccupied territory becoming occupied in a subsequent year by Yellow-billed Loons was low, and no loon chicks were successfully raised in territories that were previously unoccupied. In contrast, unoccupied territories had a much higher probability of becoming occupied by Pacific Loons, which suggests that Yellow-billed Loons have strict habitat requirements and suitable breeding lakes may be limited. Territories that were occupied had high probabilities of remaining occupied for both loon species.","[Uher-Koch, Brian D.; Wright, Kenneth G.; Uher-Koch, Hannah R.; Schmutz, Joel A.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, 4210 Univ Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Uher-Koch, Hannah R.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK USA","Uher-Koch, BD (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, 4210 Univ Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",buher-koch@usgs.gov,,,Biodiversity Research Institute; Bureau of Land Management Arctic Office; Changing Arctic Ecosystems Initiative of the U.S. Geological Survey Ecosystem Mission Area,"We thank the following individuals for field assistance: H.

Species that co-flower and share a pollinator may suffer from reproductive interference through heterospecific pollen deposition, especially when such species are closely related. However, little is known about the mechanisms that enable coexistence of co-flowering Erica species that share pollinators. Here we focus on a site where two co-flowering Erica species which are both predominantly pollinated by Cape honey bees grow intermingled, to ask whether this is associated with flower constancy and/or differences in pollen deposition sites. Despite minor differences in sites of pollen deposition on honey bees, most pollen of both Erica species was found on the head and ventral thorax regions. Subsequent visits of honey bees were almost always to the same Erica species from which they departed, and were significantly more constant than expected from random foraging in two consecutive years. Based on differences in pollen types between the two species, we established that pollen loads carried by honey bees were between 67% and 99% species-specific, whereas pollen loads on stigmas were on average over 93% pure. We conclude that despite the superficial similarities of small-flowered Erica species, honeybees can use species-specific cues for constant foraging, which is associated with almost complete absence of heterospecific pollen transfer. Future analyses of pollen carryover rates could help to quantify the benefit of pollinator behaviour for plant fecundity, and inclusion of more study sites sampled throughout the Erica flowering season could shed further light on the importance of flower constancy for facilitating coexistence of Erica species in the CFR.

In 2014, recruitment of the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides was measured at high elevations in wave-exposed intertidal habitats on the NW Atlantic coast in Nova Scotia, Canada. Values were considerably lower than previously reported for middle elevations in wave-exposed intertidal habitats on the NE Atlantic and NE Pacific coasts. To determine if such differences in recruitment may have resulted from elevation influences, I did a field experiment in 2019 in wave-exposed intertidal habitats in Nova Scotia to test the hypothesis that recruitment is higher at middle than at high elevations, based on known environmental differences between both elevation zones. Based on data from 3 locations spanning 158 km of the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, barnacle recruitment was, on average, nearly 200% higher (and recruits were larger) at middle than at high elevations. However, even with this increase, barnacle recruitment on this NW Atlantic coast is still lower than for comparable habitats on the NE Atlantic and NE Pacific coasts, and also lower than previously reported for wave-exposed locations farther south on the NW Atlantic coast, in Maine, USA. Therefore, barnacle recruitment in wave-exposed intertidal habitats on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia is moderate relative to other shores. This difference in the supply of barnacle recruits might influence the intensity of interspecific interactions involving barnacles.","[Scrosati, Ricardo A.] St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, 2320 Notre Dame Ave, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada","Scrosati, RA (corresponding author), St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Biol, 2320 Notre Dame Ave, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada.",rscrosat@stfx.ca,"Scrosati, Ricardo A/K-6172-2016","Scrosati, Ricardo A/0000-0002-3050-132X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"I am grateful to Matthew J.

However, due to the difficulty involved with conducting simultaneous marine predator and prey distribution surveys at the same scale, marine mammals have not been studied alongside their prey distribution. To understand the spatial niche overlap between 3 small cetaceans observed in the eastern coastal waters of Hokkaido, Japan (Pacific white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus obliquidens, Dall's porpoise Phocoenoides dalli, and harbor porpoise Phocoena phocoena), and the mechanisms behind the differences in their distributions, visual and hydroacoustic surveys using a quantitative echosounder were concurrently conducted. A clear spatial niche overlap was observed between the Pacific white-sided dolphin and Dall's porpoise, whereas the spatial overlap was moderate between the harbor porpoise and the other 2 species. In areas where Pacific white-sided dolphins were observed, potential prey was abundant in a shallower layer, at approximately 80-90 m depth. On the other hand, potential prey was more abundant in deeper layers in areas where Dall's and harbor porpoises were observed. Water depth affected the potential prey abundance at all depth layers (0-300 m), as potential prey were more abundant in areas with a shallower water depth. Additionally, potential prey were more abundant in shallower layers (3-200 m) than in deeper layers (200-300 m), where the maximum water depth was 3000 m. The differences in spatial niche among Pacific white-sided dolphin, Dall's porpoise, and harbor porpoise might cause their dietary differences, as they are epipelagic feeders, midwater feeders, and both epipelagic and midwater feeders, respectively.","[Iwahara, Yuka; Shirakawa, Hokuto; Miyashita, Kazushi; Mitani, Yoko] Hokkaido Univ, 20-5 Benten Cho, Hakodate, Hokkaido 0400051, Japan","Iwahara, Y (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, 20-5 Benten Cho, Hakodate, Hokkaido 0400051, Japan.",yuka.iw.irk@gmail.com,"Mitani, Yoko/D-5779-2012","Mitani, Yoko/0000-0002-7420-0596","Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from The Japan Science Society, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15J04198, 15K20828]","We acknowledge the Captain and crew on board on the T/S 'Usio Maru' in our surveys for their endless support and hard work.

Limited and haphazard survey efforts across much of Australia mean we are unsure of many species' current and former ranges, hampering our ability to identify and remedy causes of decline. The New Holland Mouse (NHM; Pseudomys novaehollandiae) is an endangered rodent species native to south-east Australia that is suspected of undergoing rapid and dramatic range contractions and local extinctions in recent decades. Here, I reassess the species' distribution across Victoria using extensive survey efforts and, subsequently, provide a summation of potential key threatening processes. In only 40 years, the NHM has been lost from seven of the 12 isolated areas where it once occurred in Victoria. Habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive predators, and potentially disease and genetic inbreeding have likely contributed to the species' rapid and continuing decline. Conservation priorities include ongoing monitoring and research, cat and fox control, exclusion of rabbit poison-baiting, targeted fire and habitat management, and reintroduction to historically occupied regions where threatening processes have been mitigated.","[Burns, Phoebe A.] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Burns, Phoebe A.] Museums Victoria, Dept Sci, GPO Box 666, Melbourne, Vic 3052, Australia","Burns, PA (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.; Burns, PA (corresponding author), Museums Victoria, Dept Sci, GPO Box 666, Melbourne, Vic 3052, Australia.",phoebe.burns@live.com,,"Burns, Phoebe/0000-0003-1015-3775","Australian Government Research Training Program ScholarshipAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science; Zoos Victoria; Parks Victoria; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Royal Zoological Society of NSW (RZSNSW) Paddy Pallin Science Grant; RZSNSW Ethel Mary Read Research Fund; David Lachlan Hay Fund; Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP)","This research was conducted with support from an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship, Zoos Victoria, Parks Victoria, the Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment, Royal Zoological Society of NSW (RZSNSW) Paddy Pallin Science Grant, RZSNSW Ethel Mary Read Research Fund, and the David Lachlan Hay Fund.

We modeled mosquito trap counts using a Bayesian hierarchical mixed-effects model with spatially correlated residuals. The models indicated an inverse relationship between temperature and mosquito trap counts for both species, which may be due to the hot and arid climate of southern Texas. The temporal trend in mosquito populations indicated Ae. aegypti populations peaking in the late spring and Ae. albopictus reaching a maximum in winter.

We hypothesized that the use of a mixture of a cereal and a legume could enhance yields under these low input conditions, because integrating an N-fixing legume in the system could mitigate N limitation for the cereal and enhance its growth. A nine-year (2008-2016) field experiment was set up with three treatments: sole oats, sole vetch and oats/vetch strip intercropping. These cropping systems were grown continuously in the same plots, to allow accrual of long-term effects. Yields and water use were quantified in years 7-9 of the experiment (2014 to 2016). With a 50/50 ratio of the area sown to the two species, the intercropped oats had a relative yield of 0.59 and intercropped vetch had a relative yield of 0.45. Oats was the dominant crop characterized by a relative yield per plant of 1.18, compared to a relative yield per plant of vetch of 0.89. However, the land equivalent ratio (LER), expressing the comparative efficiency of land use in intercropping, and the water equivalent ratio (WER), the comparative system level water use efficiency of the intercrop relative to sole crops, were both not significantly different from one. Thus we reject the hypothesis that oat/vetch intercropping increases land productivity and water use efficiency. From differences in results in years with more rainfall and years with less rainfall, we infer that yields of both species are mostly limited by water availability. On average over the three years, the yield disadvantage of vetch was fully compensated by the yield advantage of oats, due to a lack of complementarity for water acquisition. This conclusion can be generalized to the testable prediction that species selection for productive intercropping should focus on achieving complementarity for traits that interact with the factor most constraining productivity, which was rainfall in this particular crop system under the conditions of the study.","[Zhang, Yue; Nie, Jiayi; Yang, Jie; Ren, Jianhong; Zhang, Lizhen] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Yuanmingyuan West Rd 2, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yue; Duan, Yu; Ren, Jianhong; Zhang, Jun; Zhang, Lizhen] Minist Agr, Sci & Observing Expt Stn Agroenvironm, Wuchuan 010031, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Duan, Yu; Zhang, Jun] Inner Mongolia Acad Agr & Anim Husb Sci, Plant Nutr & Anal Inst, Zhaojun RD 22, Yuquan Dist 010031, Huhhot, Peoples R China; [van der Werf, Wopke; Evers, Jochem B.] Wageningen Univ, Ctr Crop Syst Anal CSA, Droevendaalsesteeg 1, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Su, Zhicheng] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China","Zhang, LZ (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Yuanmingyuan West Rd 2, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.; Zhang, LZ (corresponding author), Minist Agr, Sci & Observing Expt Stn Agroenvironm, Wuchuan 010031, Hohhot, Peoples R China.",zhanglizhen@cau.edu.cn,,"Evers, Jochem/0000-0002-3956-0190","International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Science Foundation of China [31461143025]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC1502404]; IWHR Research & Development Support Program [JZ0145B752017, 582017]; Inner Mongolia Sci-technology Innovation Project for Agriculture and Animal Husbandry [CXJJ2013N04]; European Union through the project H2020 ReMIX (Redesigning European cropping systems based on species mixtures) [727217]","The research was supported by the International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Science Foundation of China (31461143025), National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC1502404), IWHR Research & Development Support Program (JZ0145B752017, 582017), and Inner Mongolia Sci-technology Innovation Project for Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (CXJJ2013N04).

They facilitate the accumulation of carbon in peat deposits, but climate change is predicted to expose peatland ecosystem to sustained and unprecedented warming leading to a significant release of carbon to the atmosphere. Sphagnum responses to climate change, and their interaction with other components of the ecosystem, will determine the future trajectory of carbon fluxes in peatlands. We measured the growth and productivity of Sphagnum in an ombrotrophic bog in northern Minnesota, where ten 12.8-m-diameter plots were exposed to a range of whole-ecosystem (air and soil) warming treatments (+0 to +9 degrees C) in ambient or elevated (+500 ppm) CO2. The experiment is unique in its spatial and temporal scale, a focus on response surface analysis encompassing the range of elevated temperature predicted to occur this century, and consideration of an effect of co-occurring CO2 altering the temperature response surface. In the second year of warming, dry matter increment of Sphagnum increased with modest warming to a maximum at 5 degrees C above ambient and decreased with additional warming. Sphagnum cover declined from close to 100% of the ground area to <50% in the warmest enclosures. After three years of warming, annual Sphagnum productivity declined linearly with increasing temperature (13-29 g C/m(2) per degrees C warming) due to widespread desiccation and loss of Sphagnum. Productivity was less in elevated CO2 enclosures, which we attribute to increased shading by shrubs. Sphagnum desiccation and growth responses were associated with the effects of warming on hydrology. The rapid decline of the Sphagnum community with sustained warming, which appears to be irreversible, can be expected to have many follow-on consequences to the structure and function of this and similar ecosystems, with significant feedbacks to the global carbon cycle and climate change.","Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Environm Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA","Norby, RJ (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, POB 2009, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",rjn@ornl.gov,"Hanson, Paul J./D-8069-2011; Warren, Jeff/B-9375-2012; Norby, Richard/C-1773-2012","Hanson, Paul J./0000-0001-7293-3561; Warren, Jeff/0000-0002-0680-4697; Norby, Richard/0000-0002-0238-9828; Childs, Joanne/0000-0002-2002-7337",Office of ScienceUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Biological and Environmental Research; US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC0500OR22725],"Office of Science; Biological and Environmental Research; US Department of Energy, Grant/Award Number: DE-AC0500OR22725",,72,21,21,3,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Here, we investigated the relationship between host boldness/exploration tendency and gastro-intestinal helminth infection in invasive Eastern grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). We used direct helminth counts, data rarely available in host-parasite studies that often used less reliable indirect estimates of infection. We predicted that bolder animals with a strong exploration tendency will have higher parasite load than shy, less explorative hosts. We examined two parameters of parasite infection: infection status and intensity of infection. Individual personality of 207 grey squirrels was assessed by capture-mark-recapture (CMR), calculating the trappability and trap diversity indices as estimates of boldness and exploration, respectively. Since both indices were strongly correlated, we used PCA to derive a single score (first component) which had a high value for bold, exploring animals. At the end of the study, 77 individuals were euthanized and gastro-intestinal helminths were identified and counted. Overall 73% of grey squirrels were infected by Strongyloides robustus with the intensity of infection varying from 1 to 86 worms (mean +/- SE = 10.7 +/- 2.1 helminths per host). We found that bolder, more explorative animals were more likely to be infected by S. robustus. However, host personality was not related to parasite intensity, which was instead positively associated with host body mass. Our results confirm that differences in personality-related host behaviour can influence the distribution of infections within host populations and stimulate further questions on whether such personality-parasite relationships may affect the invasion process.

Environmentally driven changes in their distribution and abundance can affect the availability of capelin to predators, but there is limited information that describes how changes in ocean temperature are related to fluctuations in capelin range and density. A spatiotemporal, generalized linear mixed model was used to quantify the influence of temperature-related covariates on the occurrence and density of age1+ capelin over the continental shelf in the central and western Gulf of Alaska (GOA) during a period of warm and cold years between 2000 and 2013. Variability in capelin distribution was explained by temperature factors that vary between bathymetric zones. Capelin are predicted to concentrate in moderately stratified waters (i.e. a temperature difference of 3 to 7 degrees C) over shallow banks (<100 m bottom depth) and within deeper troughs (>= 100 m). The optimal temperature range for capelin occurrence and catch rates was 8 to 10 degrees C; steep declines occurred in waters warmer than 10.5 degrees C. In contrast to expected northern latitudinal shifts during warm years, capelin shifted northeastward towards the Kodiak Archipelago during the coldest study year, and interannual variation in mean densities was not related to regional mean temperatures. Our findings demonstrate a spatially complex response by capelin to temperature variability over the GOA shelf, and highlight the importance of including potential differences in oceanographic properties among bathymetric zones that may influence distributions of pelagic species.","[McGowan, David W.; Horne, John K.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Rogers, Lauren A.] NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","McGowan, DW (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",mcgowand@uw.edu,,"Rogers, Lauren/0000-0003-3305-6441; McGowan, David/0000-0003-3974-5117",North Pacific Research Board; NOAA FisheriesNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"We thank Matt Wilson for his leadership of the Ecosystems and Fisheries-Oceanography Coordinated Investigations late-summer midwater trawl survey.

These two species of mosquito have a wide range of distribution and strong transfer capacity. With ongoing global climate change, we are facing an increasing public health threat from the rapid spread of vectors in wider geographical areas. Based on observed occurrence records of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus and high-resolution environmental layers reflecting climate and land-use conditions, a Maxent niche modeling approach was adopted to model the current and future distribution of both species in Mainland China. Our models provide predictions of suitable habitat shifts under future climate scenarios up to the 2050s. Both species were predicted to expand their niche range to varying degrees under future climate scenarios. Aedes aegypti was modeled to expand its habitat from Guangdong, Guangxi Yunnan and Hainan to Fujian, Jiangxi and Guizhou. Aedes albopictus was modeled to increase magnitude of distribution within its present range of northern southwestern and southeastern coastal areas of Mainland China. Area and population exposed to mosquitoes are predicted to increase significantly. Environmental variables that have significant impact on the distribution of mosquitoes are also revealed by our model The results of our study can be referenced in further ecological studies and will guide the development of strategies for the prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases.

However, neither their spatial arrangement nor differences in their use of microhabitat can necessarily explain the dense co-occurrence of sympatric species. We investigated how several small mammal species share a seasonally flooded meadow of limited size, testing predictions (P1) that herbivore, granivore, insectivore, and omnivore species are separated in time (dominant in different years), (P2) that sympatric species undergo isotopic partitioning, and (P3) that there are intraspecific differences in diet. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures in the hair of seven synantropic shrew, vole, and mice species were used as a proxy for their diet. We found that the three most abundant species in eight of the nine years were from different diet groups. However, based on the number of species in the functional groups, the state of small mammal community was considered unfavored in five out of the nine investigation years. In years with the greatest dominance of Apodemus agrarius, the small mammal community was characterized by decreased diversity and Micromys minutus was either in low abundance or absent. In 2014 and 2016, years of low abundance or absence of M. oeconomus, M. agrestis, and M. glareolus were both recorded in high numbers. Differences in the isotopic signatures of the three most abundant small mammal species in the community were clearly expressed and core areas in the isotopic space were separated, showing their dependence on different dietary resources. Intraspecific dietary separation between young and adult animals was observed only in M. oeconomus. Thus, the high species diversity of small mammals and the formation of their community in this investigated flooded meadow are maintained by isotopic partitioning (segregation in dietary space) and by changes in their number over time (shifting dominance).","[Balciauskas, Linas; Skipityte, Raminta; Balciauskiene, Laima; Jasiulionis, Marius] Nat Res Ctr, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Skipityte, Raminta] Ctr Phys Sci & Technol, Vilnius, Lithuania","Balciauskas, L (corresponding author), Nat Res Ctr, Vilnius, Lithuania.",linas.balciauskas@gamtc.lt,,,,,,69,6,6,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Fungicides can reach aquatic ecosystems and occur in surface water bodies in agricultural catchments throughout the entire growing season due to their frequent, prophylactic application. However, in comparison to herbicides and insecticides, the exposure to and effects of fungicides have received less attention. We provide an overview of the risk of fungicides to aquatic ecosystems covering fungicide exposure (i.e., environmental fate, exposure modeling, and mitigation measures) as well as direct and indirect effects of fungicides on microorganisms, macrophytes, invertebrates, and vertebrates. We show that fungicides occur widely in aquatic systems, that the accuracy of predicted environmental concentrations is debatable, and that fungicide exposure can be effectively mitigated. We additionally demonstrate that fungicides can be highly toxic to a broad range of organisms and can pose a risk to aquatic biota. Finally, we outline central research gaps that currently challenge our ability to predict fungicide exposure and effects, promising research avenues, and shortcomings of the current environmental risk assessment for fungicides.","[Zubrod, Jochen P.; Bundschuh, Mirco; Bruehl, Carsten A.; Knaebel, Anja; Scharmueller, Andreas; Stehle, Sebastian; Schulz, Ralf; Schaefer, Ralf B.] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, Fortstr 7, D-76829 Landau, Germany; [Zubrod, Jochen P.; Stehle, Sebastian; Schulz, Ralf] Univ Koblenz Landau, Eusserthal Ecosyst Res Stn, Birkenthalstr 13, D-76857 Eusserthal, Germany; [Bundschuh, Mirco] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, Lennart Hjelms Vag 9, SWE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Arts, Gertie] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Environm Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Imfeld, Gwenael; Payraudeau, Sylyain] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, ENGEES, LHyGeS, 1 Rue Blessig, F-67084 Strasbourg, France; [Rasmussen, Jes J.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Vejlsoevej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Rohr, Jason] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL USA; [Rohr, Jason] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Environm Change Initiat, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Rohr, Jason] Univ Notre Dame, Eck Inst Global Hlth, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Smalling, Kelly] US Geol Survey, New Jersey Water Sci Ctr, Lawrenceville, NJ USA","Zubrod, JP (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, Fortstr 7, D-76829 Landau, Germany.; Zubrod, JP (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Eusserthal Ecosyst Res Stn, Birkenthalstr 13, D-76857 Eusserthal, Germany.",zubrod@uni-landau.de,"Bruhl, Carsten A/F-3385-2012; Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021; Schafer, Ralf Bernhard/E-1926-2011; Schulz, Ralf/G-3674-2011; Bundschuh, Mirco/H-4559-2014; Schulz, Ralf/ABI-4526-2020","Schafer, Ralf Bernhard/0000-0003-3510-1701; Schulz, Ralf/0000-0002-6348-6971; Bundschuh, Mirco/0000-0003-4876-220X; Schulz, Ralf/0000-0002-6348-6971; Scharmuller, Andreas/0000-0002-9290-3965; Imfeld, Gwenael/0000-0002-7054-4666; Zubrod, Jochen/0000-0001-9642-2205; Rasmussen, Jes/0000-0002-5932-3125","EU-INTERREG V Upper Rhine via project 1.6 SERIOR (SEcurity-RIsk-ORientation); Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development (FORMAS)Swedish Research Council Formas [942-2015-1568]; Carlsberg FoundationCarlsberg Foundation [2013_01_0833]; U.S. Geological Survey Toxic Substances Hydrology ProgramUnited States Geological Survey; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-1241889]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM109499, R01TW010286]; U.S. Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NRI 2006-01370, 2009-35102-0543]; U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [CAREER 83518801]; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [R01TW010286] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We acknowledge support by EU-INTERREG V Upper Rhine via project 1.6 SERIOR (SEcurity-RIsk-ORientation), the Swedish Research Council for Sustainable Development (FORMAS; Grant/Award Number: 942-2015-1568), the Carlsberg Foundation (Grant Number 2013_01_0833), and the U.S. Geological Survey Toxic Substances Hydrology Program, the National Science Foundation (EF-1241889), the National Institutes of Health (R01GM109499, R01TW010286), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (NRI 2006-01370, 2009-35102-0543), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (CAREER 83518801).

However, studies focused on modelling spatially explicit patterns of future invasion risk have so far focused on species response to climate change impacts, while land-use change has been neglected. We investigated how the interplay between climate and land-use change could affect the future potential distribution and dispersal corridors of four alien squirrels introduced to Europe (Sciurus carolinensis, Callosciurus finlaysonii, Callosciurus erythraeus and Eutamias sibiricus). Location and Methods Our study was conducted in Italy. We used Species Distribution Models and circuit theory methods to test whether future scenarios based only on climate change predict a different effect on range and connectivity of alien squirrel populations, compared to scenarios that include both climate and land-use changes. Results Scenarios based only on climate change predicted a range increase and a high geographic stability (>50%) for most species, with different, yet limited, effects on connectivity corridors. Conversely, scenarios based on both climate and land-use change showed a loss in range extent and a low geographic stability (<50%) of both range and dispersal corridors for most species. Main conclusions Scenarios considering both climate and land-use change provide predictions on invasion risk that overturn those including only climate change. The effect of global warming alone would lead to a considerable range expansion of all species. Conversely, when land-use change is added, a potential loss in suitable habitat and dispersal corridors is predicted for alien squirrels, hence limiting their range expansion.

Despite their importance, environmental factors that influence their interactions are poorly known. Here, we present evidence that pH significantly influences the balance between each reaction in anoxic environments that contain ferric (oxyhydr)oxide minerals. In sediment bioreactors that contained goethite as a source of ferric iron, both iron reduction and methanogenesis occurred but the balance between them varied significantly with pH. Compared to bioreactors receiving acidic media (pH 6), electron donor oxidation was 85% lower for iron reduction and 61% higher for methanogenesis in bioreactors receiving alkaline media (pH 7.5). Thus, methanogenesis displaced iron reduction considerably at alkaline pH. Geochemistry data collected from U.S. aquifers demonstrate that a similar pattern also exists on a broad spatial scale in natural settings. In contrast, in bioreactors that were not augmented with goethite, clay minerals served as the source of ferric iron and the balance between each reaction did not vary significantly with pH. We therefore conclude that pH can regulate the relative contributions of microbial iron reduction and methanogenesis to carbon fluxes from terrestrial environments. We further propose that the availability of ferric (oxyhydr)oxide minerals influences the extent to which the balance between each reaction is sensitive to pH. The results of this study advance our understanding of environmental controls on microbial methane generation and provide a basis for using pH and the occurrence of ferric minerals to refine predictions of greenhouse gas fluxes.","[Marquart, Kyle A.; Haller, Ben R.; Paper, Janet M.; Boyanov, Maxim I.; Shodunke, Ganiyat; Kirk, Matthew F.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Geol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Flynn, Theodore M.; Boyanov, Maxim I.] Argonne Natl Lab, Biosci Div, Lemont, IL USA; [Boyanov, Maxim I.] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Chem Engn, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Jin, Qusheng] Univ Oregon, Dept Earth Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Marquart, Kyle A.] Jacobs Engn, Lawrence, KS USA; [Paper, Janet M.] Benedictine Coll, Dept Biol, Atchison, KS 66002 USA; [Haller, Ben R.] Kansas Dept Hlth & Environm, Topeka, KS USA; [Gura, Colleen] Kansas State Univ, Dept Geog, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Kirk, MF (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Dept Geol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",mfkirk@ksu.edu,"Flynn, Theodore/C-1221-2008; Kirk, Matthew/AAB-9944-2020; BM, MRCAT/G-7576-2011","Flynn, Theodore/0000-0002-1838-8942; Kirk, Matthew/0000-0001-5562-7618; Jin, Qusheng/0000-0002-0808-2122",Division of Earth SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [EAR-1753436]; Biological and Environmental Research [DE-AC02-06CH11357],"Division of Earth Sciences, Grant/Award Number: EAR-1753436; Biological and Environmental Research, Grant/Award Number: DE-AC02-06CH11357",,85,8,8,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1472-4677,1472-4669,,GEOBIOLOGY,Geobiology,MAR,2019,17,2,,,,,185,198,,10.1111/gbi.12320,,,14,"Biology; Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,HL7NX,WOS:000458929400006,30387274,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2021-09-21,

However, toxicant effects within ecosystems may be altered by interactions with abiotic and biotic ecosystem components, including biological interactions. Collectively, this generates the potential for toxicant sensitivity to be highly context dependent, with significantly different outcomes in ecosystems than laboratory toxicity tests predict. We experimentally manipulated stream macroinvertebrate communities in 32 mesocosms to examine how communities from a low-salinity site were influenced by interactions with those from a high-salinity site along a gradient of salinity. Relative to those from the low-salinity site, organisms from the high-salinity site were expected to have greater tolerance and fitness at higher salinities. This created the potential for both salinity and tolerant-sensitive organism interactions to influence communities. We found that community composition was influenced by both direct toxicity and tolerant-sensitive organism interactions. Taxon and context-dependent responses included: (i) direct toxicity effects, irrespective of biotic interactions; (ii) effects that were owing to the addition of tolerant taxa, irrespective of salinity; (iii) toxicity dependent on sensitive-tolerant taxa interactions; and (iv) toxic effects that were increased by interactions.

The euphorine braconid Meteorus pulchricornis is a polyphagous koinobiont endoparasitoid of exophytic caterpillars from 15 families within 10 lepidopteran superfamilies. Here, the biology of this common but enigmatic parasitoid wasp is reviewed. The unique cocoon suspension system of M. pulchricornis protects it against predators during and after cocoon spinning. This structural cocoon protection method, as well as robust immune suppression mechanism, likely enables its very wide host range. In Japan, M. pulchricornis can reproduce both sexually and asexually, and the coexistence of sexual and asexual strains might be encouraged by its high polyphagy. In this review, the potential use of M. pulchricornis as a biocontrol agent is also addressed.","[Maeto, Kaoru] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Nada Ku, 1-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan","Maeto, K (corresponding author), Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Nada Ku, 1-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",maeto@kobe-u.ac.jp,"Maeto, Kaoru/AAB-7318-2019","Maeto, Kaoru/0000-0003-1082-6167","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [17K19268]","I thank Kentaro Itokawa, Shunsuke Shirai, and Masaki Yamamoto for granting me the permission to use their photographs in this review.

Although often extremely effective against native consumers, invasive species that avoid or overcome these defenses can wreak havoc on trees and surrounding ecosystems. This is especially true when multiple invasive species co-occur, since interactions between invasive herbivores may yield non-additive effects on the host. While the threat posed by invasive forest pests is well known, long-term field experiments are necessary to explore these consumer-host interactions at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, it is important to measure multiple variables to get a whole-plant picture of their combined impact. We report the results of a 4-yr field experiment addressing the individual and combined impacts of two invasive herbivores, the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) and elongate hemlock scale (Fiorinia externa), on native eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) in southern New England. In 2011, we planted 200 hemlock saplings into a temperate forest understory and experimentally manipulated the presence/absence of both herbivore species; in 2015, we harvested the 88 remaining saplings and assessed plant physiology, growth, and resource allocation. Adelgids strongly affected hemlock growth: infested saplings had lower above/belowground biomass ratios, more needle loss, and produced fewer new needles than control saplings. Hemlock scale did not alter plant biomass allocation or growth, and its co-occurrence did not alter the impact of adelgid. While both adelgid and scale impacted the concentrations of primary metabolites, adelgid effects were more pronounced. Adelgid feeding simultaneously increased free amino acids local to feeding sites and a similar to 30% reduction in starch. The cumulative impact of adelgid-induced needle loss, manipulation of nitrogen pools, and the loss of stored resources likely accelerates host decline through disruption of homeostatic source-sink dynamics occurring at the whole-plant level. Our research stresses the importance of considering long-term impacts to predict how plants will cope with contemporary pressures experienced in disturbed forests.","[Wilson, Claire M.; Hickin, Mauri L.; Rigsby, Chad M.; Thornber, Carol S.; Preisser, Evan L.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Schaeffer, Robert N.; Sommi, Amanda F.; Orians, Colin M.] Tufts Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Schaeffer, Robert N.] Washington State Univ, Dept Entomol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Hickin, Mauri L.] USDA APHIS, Buzzards Bay, MA 02542 USA; [Thornber, Carol S.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","Preisser, EL (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",preisser@uri.edu,"Schaeffer, Robert/R-7577-2019; Thornber, Carol/B-5786-2014","Orians, Colin/0000-0003-3773-0894; Thornber, Carol/0000-0003-0034-1035","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF-DEB 1256826, NSF-DEB 1256769]; National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-67013-30142]","C.

Two agricultural soils, one silty loam and one silty clay were spiked with TFL (0, 0.84, 8.4, and 84 mg kg(-1)) and studied the effects using a laboratory microcosm approach. The half-lives were 44.19-61.83 d in all cases. Bacterial abundance increased 1.12-5.56 times by TFL, but the diversity decreased. From the next-generation sequencing results, TFL altered the bacterial community structure, which initially diverged from the control community structure, then recovered, and then diverged again. Linear discriminant analysis effect size indicated that Sphingomonas and Xanthomonadaceae were the predominant species on day 7 and 15 in TFL treatments. N-2-fixing bacteria were initially increased, then decreased, and then recovered, and it was positively correlated with NH4+-N content. Compared with the control, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria were decreased by 25.51-92.63%, ammonia-oxidizing archaea were decreased by 17.12-85.21% (except day 7), and the NO3--N concentration was also inhibited. In contrast to bacteria, fungal abundance was inhibited without any observable effects on fungal diversity or community structure.

Despite this, few null models exist to test the significance of suspected traplines, particularly for studies interested in the role of individual decision-making in the formation of traplines versus the role of resource layouts and random movement patterns. Here, we present a spatially explicit, individual-based null model, which may be used to test whether resource layout and realistic forager movement may account for sequence repeats in suspected traplines. In our model, we generate resource visitation sequences by modeling a forager without spatial memory using a random walk to discover and visit spatially fixed resources. We quantify traplining using Determinism, a metric derived from recurrence quantification analysis. Using both simulated and empirical bee foraging data, we compared our model with 2 existing null models-a completely random model and a sample randomization model. The former creates null sequences by randomly selecting available resources, whereas the latter randomizes the order of visits in observed sequences. We found that our model has a higher propensity of being (correctly) rejected than a sample randomization model for trapliners, and a lower propensity of being (incorrectly) rejected for non-trapliners compared to a completely random model. The use of a spatially explicit individual-based null model to test the statistical significance of patterns in empirical data is a novel approach that may be useful for other spatial and individual-based processes.","[Ayers, Carolyn A.; Brosi, Berry J.] Emory Univ, Dept Environm Sci, 400 Dowman Dr,Suite E510, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Ayers, Carolyn A.; Brosi, Berry J.] Emory Univ, Program Populat Biol Ecol & Evolut, 400 Dowman Dr,Suite E510, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Armsworth, Paul R.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 569 Dabney Hall,1416 Circle Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Armsworth, Paul R.] Univ Tennessee, Natl Inst Math & Biol Synth, 569 Dabney Hall,1416 Circle Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Ayers, CA (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Dept Environm Sci, 400 Dowman Dr,Suite E510, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.; Ayers, CA (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Program Populat Biol Ecol & Evolut, 400 Dowman Dr,Suite E510, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",carolyn.a.ayers@gmail.com,,"Brosi, Berry/0000-0002-9233-1151","US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1120572]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1300426]; University of Tennessee, Knoxville","This work was supported by the US National Science Foundation (grant number DEB-1120572 to B.J.B.).

Rabies is a disease that has been present in Alaska continuously for over 100 years. It is maintained in bats and foxes with the arctic fox likely playing a bigger role in maintaining the virus, although a multi-host system with both red and arctic foxes cannot be excluded.

Five annual legumes [cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.), lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.), lablab (Lablab purpureus L.), and pole bean (P. vulgaris L.)] were intercropped between two rows of sorghum spaced at 0.75 m and compared with sole sorghum under irrigation. Intercropping legumes with sorghum increased leaf area index (LAI) compared with sorghum alone, at both locations. Intercropping legumes with sorghum resulted in faster canopy coverage and greater light interception early in the growing season compared with sorghum alone. Lablab, cowpea, lima bean, and pole bean were promising legumes to improve light interception when intercropping with sorghum. The LAI was an accurate growth predictor of light interception in all intercropping systems and sorghum alone (R-2 > 0.94). Overall, optimum LAI (90% light interception) was lower in all intercropping systems compared with sorghum alone. Dry matter accumulation had strong correlations with LAI and light interception at both locations before canopy closure (58 d after planting). Overall, intercropping legumes in forage sorghum benefits producers by providing protein to livestock and reduces the need to purchase dietary supplements in their traditional livestock production systems.","[Darapuneni, Murali K.; Lauriault, Leonard M.] New Mexico State Univ, Agr Sci Ctr, Tucumcari, NM 88401 USA; [Angadi, Sangamesh.

However, to date, little is known about the specific role of fine roots. The main objective of our study was to assess the influence of fine roots on the Si cycle in a temperate forest in north-eastern France. Silicon pools and fluxes in vegetal solid and solution phases were quantified within each ecosystem compartment, i.e. in the atmosphere, above-ground and below-ground tree tissues, forest floor and different soil layers, on three plots, each with different soil types, i.e. Dystric Cambisol (DC), Eutric Cambisol (EC) and Rendzic Leptosol (RL). In this study, we took advantage of a natural soil gradient, from shallow calcic soil to deep moderately acidic soil, with similar climates, atmospheric depositions, species compositions and management. Soil solutions were measured monthly for 4 years to study the seasonal dynamics of Si fluxes. A budget of dissolved Si (DSi) was also determined for the forest floor and soil layers. Our study highlighted the major role of fine roots in the Si cycle in forest ecosystems for all soil types. Due to the abundance of fine roots mainly in the superficial soil layers, their high Si concentration (equivalent to that of leaves and 2 orders higher than that of coarse roots) and their rapid turnover rate (approximately 1 year), the mean annual Si fluxes in fine roots in the three plots were 68 and 110 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for the RL and the DC, respectively. The turnover rates of fine roots and leaves were approximately 71 and 28% of the total Si taken up by trees each year, demonstrating the importance of biological recycling in the Si cycle in forests. Less than 1% of the Si taken up by trees each year accumulated in the perennial tissues. This study also demonstrated the influence of soil type on the concentration of Si in the annual tissues and therefore on the Si fluxes in forests. The concentrations of Si in leaves and fine roots were approximately 1.5-2.0 times higher in the Si-rich DC compared to the Si-poor RL. In terms of the DSi budget, DSi production was large in the three plots in the forest floor (9.9 to 12.7 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), as well as in the superficial soil layer (5.3 to 14.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), and decreased with soil depth. An immobilization of DSi was even observed at 90 cm depth in plot DC (-1.7 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). The amount of Si leached from the soil profile was relatively low compared to the annual uptake by trees (13% in plot DC to 29% in plot RL). The monthly measurements demonstrated that the seasonal dynamics of the DSi budget were mainly linked to biological activity. Notably, the peak of dissolved Si production in the superficial soil layer occurred during winter and probably resulted from fine-root decomposition. Our study reveals that biological processes, particularly those involving fine roots, play a predominant role in the Si cycle in temperate forest ecosystems, while the geochemical processes appear to be limited.","[Turpault, Marie-Pierre; Kirchen, Gil; Cochet, Carine] Ctr INRA Nancy, UR 1138, INRA Biogeochim Ecosyst Forestiers, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Calvaruso, Christophe] EcoSustain, Environm Engn Off, Res & Dev, F-57330 Kanfen, France; [Redon, Paul-Olivier] Ctr Meuse Haute Marne, Andra, Direct Rech & Dev, Route Dept 960, F-55290 Bure, France","Turpault, MP (corresponding author), Ctr INRA Nancy, UR 1138, INRA Biogeochim Ecosyst Forestiers, F-54280 Champenoux, France.",marie-pierre.turpault@inra.fr,,,INRA [9]; GIP-EcoforFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [1138451B]; Andra,"We acknowledge Serge Didier for site implementation and management; Laurent Saint-Andre, Laura Franoux and Astrid Genet for the development of allometric equations; Claire Pantigny, Louisette Gelhaye, Bruno Simon, Claude Nys, Jonathan Mangin, Celine Goldstein, Frederique Cesar, Maelle D'Arbaumont and Maxime Simon for technical help; Lise Salsi, for preparing the samples and performing the SEM and EDX analyses; the National Forest Office (ONF) for welcoming our experimental site in the domanial forest of Montiers and for the stand management and American Journal Experts; and Krista Bateman for reviewing the English of the paper, as well as the reviewers who have, through their suggestions, significantly improved the quality of the manuscript.

Here, we present results from a 54-biweek long study of Ae. j. japonicus abundance in ovitraps set across the altitudinal gradient of Mt. Konpira, Nagasaki, Japan. Spatially, we found that Ae. j. japonicus fourth instar larvae (Aj4il) were more abundant at the base and top of Mt.

In contrast, we found that temporally Aj4il were more abundant when ovitrap WT was more leptokurtic with 2 weeks of lag, and with high relative humidity SD with 2 months of lag. We also found that Aj4il were unlikely present when ovitrap WT was below 12.41 degrees C. Parameter estimates for the Ricker model suggested that Ae. j. japonicus population growth was under density-dependence regulation, with a stable population dynamics whose fluctuations were associated with changes in ovitrap WT kurtosis and demographic stochasticity.

As such, they may serve as sentinel species, warning humans of alterations in habitat and ecosystem integrity in a region that is undergoing vast change due to climate warming. Here, we characterized the abundance and habitat use of four arctic breeding species of loons in the plains and surrounding mountains of western Chukotka, Russia. Loon surveys were conducted on foot and by boat from 2009-2015. Loon species differed in their use of the four lacustrine habitat types within the study area. In yedoma habitat, the yellow-billed loon (Gavia. adamsii) was the most abundant (0.593 birds/km(2)); on fluvial plain habitat, Pacific loons (G. pacifica) outnumbered other loons (0.701 birds/km(2)); mountain valleys were inhabited similarly by pacifica (0.354 birds/km(2)) and red-throated loons (G.stellata; 0.307); and maritime tundra was used only by pacifica (1.13) and Arctic loons (G. arctica; 0.553). G. adamsii was not observed in mountain valleys or maritime tundra. Mountainous portions of rivers were predominantly occupied by stellata and pacifica, and lowland rivers by stellata, pacifica and arctica. There was a significant difference in the size of lakes occupied by the four congeners. The largest loon, adamsii, occupied the largest lakes (0.69 km(2)), 80% larger than lakes utilized by pacifica (0.39 km(2)) and arctica (0.38 km(2)), and 35 times larger than stellata (0.02 km(2)).

Although migratory species move across a wide range of environments during migration, their dynamic response to environments has rarely been considered. Taking advantage of the fine spatial-temporal resolution of satellite tracking data, we studied habitat selection of East Asian greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) along their spring migration route from Yangtze River Basin to Lena Delta and Yana Bay. We developed a novel methodology to improve dynamic species distribution models (SDMs) by incorporating environmental variables derived from remotely sensed data precisely corresponding to migration time. Our results demonstrate that distance to the nearest water body, elevation, human population density and temperature contribute greatly to the models. Water-related and topographic factors (e.g., elevation, slope and distance to the nearest water body) were consistently associated with habitat selection of the geese from wintering area to breeding area, while the varied influences of temperature and human population density in different migration periods are closely related to their adaptation to local environments. In addition, response curves of vegetation index indicate that the geese are more strongly associated with food quality than quantity in wintering area and stopover sites. By building SDMs in different periods, we provide a unique dynamic perspective on how a long-distance migrant responds to different environments. The methodology proposed here could be integrated to future conservation management plans for predicting species relationship with fast changing environmental conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate the roles cetaceans may have in such interspecific interactions in this system, we studied within-season and interannual occurrence patterns of Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) and type-B and type-C killer whales (Orcinus orca) within the southwestern Ross Sea, 2002-2015. Time series analysis summarized daily observations made from 3 shore localities: Capes Crozier, Bird, and Royds distributed around the similar to 120 km periphery of Ross Island. In early mid-November, both species arrived at Crozier, the easternmost point and westward edge of the Ross Sea Polynya marginal ice zone. Subsequently, coinciding with decreased sea ice cover and numbers off Crozier, both species appeared off Bird, then Royds, 80 and 117 km to the west/southwest, respectively. Arrival in either area coincided with SIC decreasing to < 80%, consistent with observations elsewhere. Within-season off Crozier, both species occurred in cycles of multi-day presence followed by absence, perhaps reflecting the spatio-temporal patchiness of prey indicated also by penguin foraging patterns. Within-season off Royds, especially for killer whales, occurrence was even more episodic; type-Bs arrived before type-Cs, and results support previously described resident and transient portions of the type-C population. Combined with results showing that whale arrival leads to food stress among penguins, we suggest that relatively few cetaceans can alter food availability to alter the foraging behavior of other mesopredators, despite primary productivity being the richest in the Southern Ocean.","[Ainley, David G.; Lindke, Ken; Pennycook, Jean; Santora, Jarrod A.] HT Harvey & Associates Ecol Consultants, 983 Univ Ave,Bldg D, Los Gatos, CA 95032 USA; [Lindke, Ken] Calif Dept Fish & Wildlife, 5341 Ericson Way, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Ballard, Grant; Jennings, Scott; Toniolo, Viola] Point Blue Conservat Sci, 3820 Cypress Dr 11, Petaluma, CA 94954 USA; [Lyver, Phil O'B.] Landcare Res New Zealand, POB 69040, Lincoln 7640, New Zealand; [Jennings, Scott] Cypress Grove Res Ctr, Audubon Canyon Ranch, POB 808, Marshall, CA 94940 USA; [Massaro, Melanie] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Sch Environm Sci, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia; [Santora, Jarrod A.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Stock Assessment Res, 110 Shaffer Rd, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","Ainley, DG (corresponding author), HT Harvey & Associates Ecol Consultants, 983 Univ Ave,Bldg D, Los Gatos, CA 95032 USA.",dainley@penguinscience.com,"Massaro, Melanie/P-4791-2017","Massaro, Melanie/0000-0001-9039-1268","U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OPP 9526865, 9814882, 0125608, ANT 0440643, 0944411, 0944694]; New Zealand's Foundation for Research, Science and TechnologyNew Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and Technology [C09527, C09X0510, C01X1226]; NZ Ministry of Science and Innovation [C01X1001]; Landcare Research NZ grants; Directorate For GeosciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1543498] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Office of Polar Programs (OPP)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1543541] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Indispensable were the efforts of persons who aided in data collection: K.

The preference-performance hypothesis (PPH) predicts that organisms lacking parental care should oviposit in habitats that optimise offspring performance. Preference-performance relationships were investigated for the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus Skuse) and the southern housemosquito (Culex quinquefasciatus Say) (Diptera: Culicidae), two medically important container-breeding species, in response to an organic chemical blend mimicking decaying plant matter. Additionally, the effects of long-term laboratory colonisation of Cx. quinquefasciatus using wild and laboratory strains were evaluated. 2. Oviposition bioassays were conducted by releasing gravid mosquitoes into field enclosures with automobile tires containing low and high concentrations of the chemical blend, and water controls. The offspring were then reared in water collected from the tires in which they were deposited. 3. Aedes albopictus and wild Cx. quinquefasciatus laid more eggs in the chemical blend than water controls but did not differentiate between the low and high concentrations. Conversely, laboratory Cx. quinquefasciatus only preferred the high concentration to the low concentration. No statistical associations between oviposition preference and larval survival were found, as the chemical blend did not affect survivorship of either species. 4. The oviposition preference for the chemical blend over water controls suggests that both species oviposit in the best available resource environment, but further studies are needed before conclusions regarding preference-performance relationships can be drawn. 5. It was found that long-term laboratory colonisation affects the oviposition behaviour in Cx. quinquefasciatus, suggesting that behavioural studies on laboratory strains are not always applicable to wild populations.","[Allgood, Davide W.; Yee, Donald A.] Univ Southern Mississippi, Dept Biol Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA","Yee, DA (corresponding author), Univ Southern Mississippi, Dept Biol Sci, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA.",donald.yee@usm.edu,,,National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R15 AI-92404-01A1]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DB I0923063]; University of Southern Mississippi's Department of Biological Sciences; Mississippi Entomological Association; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI092404] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"Funding was provided by the National Institutes of Health (R15 AI-92404-01A1 to D.

While efforts to develop therapeutics, vaccines, and novel genetic mosquito-control technologies are underway, many important underlying ecological questions remain that could significantly enhance our understanding and ability to predict and prevent transmission. Here, we review the current knowledge about the transmission ecology of two recent arbovirus invaders, the chikungunya and Zika viruses. We introduce the viruses and mosquito vectors, highlighting viral biology, historical routes of transmission, and viral mechanisms facilitating rapid global invasion. In addition, we review factors contributing to vector global invasiveness and transmission efficiency. We conclude with a discussion of how human-induced biotic and abiotic environmental changes facilitate mosquito-borne virus transmission, emphasizing critical gaps in understanding. These knowledge gaps are tremendous; much of our data on basic mosquito ecology in the field predate 1960, and the mosquitoes themselves, as well as the world they live in, have substantially changed. A concerted investment in understanding the basic ecology of these vectors, which serve as the main drivers of pathogen transmission in both wildlife and human populations, is now more important than ever.","[Shragai, Talya; Harrington, Laura C.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, 3138 Comstock Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Tesla, Blanka; Murdock, Courtney] Univ Georgia, Dept Infect Dis, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Tesla, Blanka; Murdock, Courtney] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Harrington, LC (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, 3138 Comstock Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",lch27@cornell.edu,,,USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture multistate Project [NYC-139835/NE-1443]; National Science Foundation (NSF)-EEID RAPIDNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1640780],"This research was funded in part by USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture multistate Project NYC-139835/NE-1443.

Associational effects (AE) can transpire through changes in herbivore or plant traits that affect herbivore movement, densities, and feeding behaviors to ultimately affect plant damage. While much work has focused on understanding the mechanisms that underlie associational effects, we know little about how these mechanisms are influenced by neighborhood composition, i.e., plant density or relative frequency which is necessary to make predictions about when AE should occur in nature. Using a series of field and greenhouse experiments, I examined how plant density and relative frequency affected plant damage to Solanum carolinense and four mechanisms that underlie AE; (i) accumulation of insect herbivores and arthropod predators, (ii) microclimate conditions, (iii) plant resistance, and (iv) specialist herbivore preference. I found a positive relationship between S. carolinense damage and the relative frequency of a non-focal neighbor (Solidago altissima) and all four AE mechanisms were influenced by one or multiple neighborhood components. Frequency-dependence in S. carolinense damage is most likely due to greater generalist herbivore load on S. carolinense (through spillover from S. altissima) with microclimate variables, herbivore preference, predation pressures, and plant resistance having relatively weaker effects. Associational effects may have long-term consequences for these two plant species during plant succession and understanding context-dependent herbivory has insect pest management implication for other plant species in agriculture and forestry.","[Kim, Tania N.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Kim, Tania N.] Univ Wisconsin, Great Lakes Bioenergy Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Kim, TN (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; Kim, TN (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Great Lakes Bioenergy Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",tania.kim@wisc.edu,,,National Science Foundation Division of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1110460],"This research was supported by the National Science Foundation Division of Environmental Biology #1110460.

This study developed and validated a bioenergetics model for Brown Bullhead in the laboratory and then applied the model to evaluate potential changes in growth and distribution associated with climate change. The model performed very well in laboratory validations at two temperatures and two ration levels-within 4% between observed and predicted values. Modeling of a 4 degrees C increase in water temperatures due to climate warming suggested increases in growth in the northern parts of the species' natural range and declines or extirpation in the south. In addition to distribution shifts, the warmer temperatures could increase biometabolism of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or bioaccumulation at local scales that may lead to changes in population structure or consumption advisories of Brown Bullhead.","[Hartman, Kyle J.] West Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, 322 Percival Hall, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA","Hartman, KJ (corresponding author), West Virginia Univ, Div Forestry & Nat Resources, 322 Percival Hall, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",hartman@wvu.edu,,,Division of Forestry and Natural Resources at West Virginia University; McIntire Stennis program,"This study would not have been possible without the efforts of students in the Fish Ecology class at West Virginia University: A.

Amblyseius largoensis is considered a generalist due to its ability to feed on multiple food sources (e.g. phytophagous mites, small insects, plant exudates, nectar, and pollen). Specimens of A. largoensis sometimes attack each other in competitive situations. Thus, we hypothesized that intraspecific interactions, such as cannibalism, may occur when heterospecific prey are scarce. Experiments were conducted to determine whether, and to what extent, the availability of heterospecific prey, eggs of R. indica, influenced the tendencies of A. largoensis to cannibalise. Additionally, the oviposition of A. largoensis was measured in the presence and absence of both conspecific nymphs and R. indica eggs. Overall, in the absence of the heterospecific prey, A. largoensis consumed conspecific nymphs, and few eggs were produced, whereas in the presence of abundant herbivorous prey, cannibalism decreased, and oviposition increased. These results suggest that, similar to other phytoseiid mites, A. largoensis employs cannibalism as an adaptive survival strategy when heterospecific prey is absent or scarce.","[Mendes, Jairo A.; Barros, Maria E.

Uncertainty still exists surrounding the ecological effects of reintroductions however, particularly when they involve historically sympatric taxa. We initiated a study to estimate any potential impacts to rainbow/steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) that may arise from reintroducing coho salmon (O. kisutch) in Taneum Creek, Washington, following their extirpation approximately 100 years ago. Prior to reintroducing coho salmon into Taneum Creek, we conducted a formal risk assessment to predict potential impacts to rainbow trout that might result from restoring coho salmon natural production in this stream. Following the assessment, adult coho salmon were released to spawn naturally in experimental reaches in Taneum Creek during a five year period, 2008-2012. Rainbow trout abundance, average size, condition, and growth were not reduced in our experimental reaches relative to control locations following the reintroduction of coho salmon; a result predicted from our ecological risk assessment. Our findings validate the utility of the ecological risk assessment for predicting and reducing undesirable effects of reintroductions involving historically sympatric salmonids.","[Temple, Gabriel M.] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, 600 Capitol Way North, Olympia, WA 98501 USA; [Newsome, Todd] Yakama Nation Fisheries, POB 151, Toppenish, WA 98948 USA; [Webster, Timothy D.; Coil, Scott W.] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, 600 Capitol Way North, Olympia, WA 98501 USA","Temple, GM (corresponding author), Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, 600 Capitol Way North, Olympia, WA 98501 USA.",gabriel.temple@dfw.wa.gov,,,Bonneville Power Administration; Yakima/Klickitat Fisheries Project,"We would like to acknowledge that this work would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of numerous individuals from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Yakama Nation through the years.

When parasite populations are at relatively low abundance, the negative effects on host populations may be insignificant, but when parasite abundance increases beyond critical thresholds, they can have population limiting effects on the host. Here, we used data from a 40-yr demographic study on breeding Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) and avian brood parasitic Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) in the mid-Atlantic United States to disentangle host-parasite interactions. The relative abundance for these two species has changed both locally and regionally over this time period with a reduction in host abundance coincident with an increase in the parasite population. We detected a fivefold increase in Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism rates of Wood Thrushes over the 40-yr time period leading to a reduction in Wood Thrush fitness (i.e.,adult survival, fecundity, and recruitment). After accounting for the effects of Wood Thrush age, individual, and annual and within-season variation in reproduction, we found that Wood Thrushes exhibited increased reproductive effort (produced more nests per year) as nest parasitism rates increased. Additionally, we found that as parasitism rates increased, both Wood Thrush clutch size and fecundity declined. In conjunction with widespread habitat loss and land use change on both wintering and breeding ranges, increasing rates of Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism are reducing Wood Thrush fitness, and are likely contributing to observed regional Wood Thrush population declines. Coordinated local and regional efforts to reduce Brown-headed Cowbird populations, particularly in fragmented landscapes, may help reduce the decline for Wood Thrushes, and likely other parasitized Neotropical migratory species.","[Ladin, Zachary S.] Univ Delaware, Dept Entomol & Wildlife Ecol, 264 Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [D'Amico, Vincent] US Forest Serv, Northern Res Stn, 531 South Coll Ave,Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Baetens, Jan M.] Univ Ghent, Dept Math Modeling Stat & Bioinformat, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Roth, Roland R.; Shriver, W.

New improvements in mechanistic effect modeling have allowed a better characterization of the ecological risks of pesticides through the incorporation of biological trait information and landscape parameters to assess individual, population and/or community-level effects and recovery. Similarly to exposure models, ecological models require scenarios that describe the environmental context in which they are applied. In this article, we propose a conceptual framework for the development of ecological scenarios that, when merged with exposure scenarios, will constitute environmental scenarios for prospective aquatic ERA. These unified environmental scenarios are defined as the combination of the biotic and abiotic parameters that are required to characterize exposure, (direct and indirect) effects, and recovery of aquatic nontarget species under realistic worst-case conditions. Ideally, environmental scenarios aim to avoid a potential mismatch between the parameter values and the spatial-temporal scales currently used in aquatic exposure and effect modeling. This requires a deeper understanding of the ecological entities we intend to protect, which can be preliminarily addressed by the formulation of ecological scenarios. In this article we present a methodological approach for the development of ecological scenarios and illustrate this approach by a case-study for Dutch agricultural ditches and the example focal species Sialis lutaria. Finally, we discuss the applicability of ecological scenarios in ERA and propose research needs and recommendations for their development and integration with exposure scenarios.

However, it remains generally unclear whether the production and exchange of metabolites incurs fitness costs to the producing cells and if so, which ecological mechanisms can facilitate a cooperative exchange of metabolites among unrelated individuals. We hypothesized that positive assortment within structured environments can maintain mutualistic cross-feeding. To test this, we engineered Acinetobacter baylyi and Escherichia coli to reciprocally exchange essential amino acids. Interspecific coculture experiments confirmed that non-cooperating types were selectively favoured in spatially unstructured (liquid culture), yet disfavoured in spatially structured environments (agar plates). Both an individual-based model and experiments with engineered genotypes indicated that a segregation of cross-feeders and non-cooperating auxotrophs stabilized cooperative cross-feeding in spatially structured environments. Chemical imaging confirmed that auxotrophs were spatially excluded from cooperative benefits. Together, these results demonstrate that cooperative cross-feeding between different bacterial species is favoured in structured environments such as bacterial biofilms, suggesting this type of interactions might be common in natural bacterial communities.","[Pande, Samay; Kost, Christian] Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Bioorgan Chem, Expt Ecol & Evolut Res Grp, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Kaftan, Filip; Svatos, Ales] Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Res Grp Mass Spectrometry, Jena, Germany; [Lang, Stefan; Germerodt, Sebastian] Univ Jena, Dept Bioinformat, Jena, Germany; [Pande, Samay] ETH, Evolutionary Biol Grp, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Kost, C (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Bioorgan Chem, Expt Ecol & Evolut Res Grp, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",christiankost@gmail.com,"Svatos, Ales/A-3305-2014; Kost, Christian/N-1553-2014","Svatos, Ales/0000-0003-1032-7288; Kost, Christian/0000-0002-7870-7343; Pande, Samay/0000-0002-4897-3923",Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; Jena School of Microbial Communication (JSMC),"We thank Michael Reichelt for help with amino acid measurements, Wilhelm Boland for support as well as Bill S Hansson for providing access to the fluorescence microscope.

The model employs cellular automata and utilizes machine learning to provide the transition rules. We examined the effects that various cell sizes and neighborhood extents had on pattern detection and model behavior. We obtained the transition probabilities using boosted regression trees in a way that accounts for the spatial arrangement of the neighboring cells. The results show the influence of the scale settings on the ability to detect and simulate patterns of Phragmites dynamics. The introduced method of quantifying the neighborhood effect, based on the spatial arrangement of the neighboring cells, displayed potential for capturing directional influences within the neighborhood.

One such hypothesis is that negative interactions between closely related species can drive phenotypic divergence. Such divergence is thought to be ubiquitous, though well-documented cases are surprisingly rare. On small islands in Florida, we found that the lizard Anolis carolinensis moved to higher perches following invasion by Anolis sagrei and, in response, adaptively evolved larger toepads after only 20 generations. These results illustrate that interspecific interactions between closely related species can drive evolutionary change on observable time scales.","[Stuart, Y. E.; Reynolds, R. G.; Losos, J.

However, with regard to spatial patterns of shrub proliferation, little is known about how they are influenced by grazing or the extent to which they are influenced by intraspecific interactions. We addressed these questions by quantifying changes in the spatial distribution of Prosopis velutina (mesquite) shrubs over 74 years on grazed and protected grasslands. Livestock are effective agents of mesquite dispersal and mesquite plants have lateral roots extending well beyond the canopy. We therefore hypothesized that mesquite distributions would be random on grazed areas mainly due to cattle dispersion and clustered on protected areas due to decreased dispersal and interspecific interference with grasses; and that clustered or random distributions at early stages of encroachment would give way to regular distributions as stands matured and density-dependent interactions intensified. Assessments in 1932, 1948, and 2006 supported the first hypothesis, but we found no support for the second. In fact, clustering intensified with time on the protected area and the pattern remained random on the grazed site. Although shrub density increased on both areas between 1932 and 2006, we saw no progression toward a regular distribution indicative of density-dependent interactions. We propose that processes related to seed dispersal, grass-shrub seedling interactions, and hydrological constraints on shrub size interact to determine vegetation structure in grassland-to-shrubland state changes with implications for ecosystem function and management.","[Browning, Dawn M.; Gillan, Jeffrey K.] New Mexico State Univ, USDA ARS, Jornada Expt Range, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Browning, Dawn M.; Archer, Steven R.; Guertin, D.

The variables used as sources of variation for analysis were the habitat quality (resprouted holm oak abundance) in the territories, the spatial distribution of territories (peripheral or interior nest boxes), the entrance-hole size of available nest boxes, the social context around the nesting territories (breeding neighbour density: conspecific or Great tits Parus major) and temporal pattern of reproduction (laying date). For whole breeding population, the proportion of successful nests and the breeding success were dependent on the location of territories and entrance-hole of nest boxes. The prediction concerning the relationship between habitat quality and reproductive performance is supported only for clutch size. This trait, but not the hatching and breeding success, clearly depended on resprouted holm oak abundance in the territories, increasing with the abundance of trees. Blue tits exhibited a clustered territoriality and the conspecific and Great tit P. major densities around blue tit territories were mutually influenced in a negative way. The breeding success variation in successful nests is positively associated to the conspecific density: individuals with more conspecific neighbours achieved best breeding success. For all nests pooled (successful and unsuccessful), reproductive performance was not dependent on the great tit density. Reproductive failure was higher in the large-holed nest boxes than in the small-holed ones. The clutch size also showed a significant gradient as a function of the egg-laying date: females laying eggs earlier in the season had larger clutch sizes than those who did later. From these results, we draw some implications for the management strategies of hole-nesting passerines using nest boxes in large areas of stone pines plantations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Management strategies aimed at conserving biodiversity need to be informed by the actual impacts of highly abundant species, whether native or introduced. In this study we examined characteristics of two bird species, introduced common mynas and native noisy miners, both of which are highly abundant in urbanised areas along the East coast of Australia. Current managerial practices have a strong focus on eradication of common mynas, while noisy miners are largely ignored. However, in this study noisy miners were found in a broader range of habitats, and in greater abundance, than common mynas; displayed more aggressive behaviour; and were linked to a decline in the diversity and abundance of other species where common mynas were not. We suggest that the adaptability of a species and the variety of habitats it can colonise may be a better predictor of its potential impact, than whether it is native or introduced.","[Haythorpe, Kathryn M.; Sulikowski, Danielle] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Psychol, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia; [Burke, Darren] Univ Newcastle, Sch Psychol, Ourimbah, NSW 2258, Australia","Haythorpe, KM (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Psychol, Panorama Ave, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia.",kathryn.haythorpe@gmail.com,"Sulikowski, Danielle/A-9949-2013","Sulikowski, Danielle/0000-0001-5574-7054",Lake Macquarie City Council,"All work was conducted under the Newcastle University Animal Ethics Committee ethics protocols A-2008-173 and A-2011-103.

Four is, however, the minimum number of species that, by allowing other interactions beyond the single, cyclic loop, breaks both the full intransitivity of the food graph and the one-predator, one-prey symmetry. Lutz et al. [J. Theor. Biol. 317, 286 (2013)] have shown the existence, on a square lattice, of two distinct phases, with either four or three coexisting species. In both phases, each agent is eventually replaced by one of its predators, but these strategy oscillations remain localized as long as the interactions are short ranged. Distant regions may be either out of phase or cycling through different food-web subloops (if any). Here we show that upon replacing a minimum fraction Q of the short-range interactions by long-range ones, there is a Hopf bifurcation, and global oscillations become stable. Surprisingly, to build such long-distance, global synchronization, the four-species coexistence phase requires fewer long-range interactions than the three-species phase, while one would naively expect the opposite to be true. Moreover, deviations from highly homogeneous conditions (chi = 0 or 1) increase Q(c), and the more heterogeneous is the food web, the harder the synchronization is. By further increasing Q, while the three-species phase remains stable, the four-species one has a transition to an absorbing, single-species state. The existence of a phase with global oscillations for S > 3, when the interaction graph has multiple subloops and several possible local cycles, leads to the conjecture that global oscillations are a general characteristic, even for large, realistic food webs.","[Rulquin, Charlotte] Ecole Normale Super, Int Ctr Fundamental Phys, F-75005 Paris, France; [Rulquin, Charlotte; Arenzon, Jeferson J.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Fis, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil","Rulquin, C (corresponding author), Ecole Normale Super, Int Ctr Fundamental Phys, 45 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France.",rulquin@clipper.ens.fr; arenzon@if.ufrgs.br,"Arenzon, Jeferson J/C-4999-2009","Arenzon, Jeferson J/0000-0001-8373-6475",Brazilian agency CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Brazilian agency FapergsFundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS); Brazilian agency CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); IF-UFRGS; ENS-Paris and Ile de France (AMIE grant),"We thank A.F.

Problems in the United Kingdom (U.K.) therefore predated recognition of global amphibian declines and were due to relatively simple causes, notably habitat modification and destruction. Pesticides, acid rain, ultraviolet radiation, climate change, and disease have thus far proved relatively minor issues. Amphibian conservation started in the 1970s, initially with status surveys, but by the 1980s research into habitat requirements and proactive management was underway, particularly for the rare Bufo calamita (Natterjack Toad). The relatively widespread Triturus cristatus (Great Crested Newt) was given the same legal protection as B. calamita in 1981 due largely to declines elsewhere in Europe. This protection has become problematic for conservationists on account of the many sites with this newt that regularly come under threat from development. Additional difficulties identified in the 1990s included serious impacts of road mortality on Bufo bufo (Common Toad) and inbreeding in urban populations of this species and of Rana temporaria (Common Frog). A previously unrecognized rare native, the northern clade of Pelophylax (formerly Rana) lessonae (Northern Pool Frog) became extinct in the early 1990s but was reintroduced in the 2000s. In the past 4 decades conservation efforts have stabilized, although not increased, the U.K. B. calamita population, but some of the widespread species are still declining, albeit at a slower rate than in the postwar period. Effective methods for amphibian conservation are now available and the outstanding question is whether there will be sufficient funding to make greater gains in future.","Amphibian & Reptile Conservat, Bournemouth BH1 4AP, Dorset, England","Beebee, TJC (corresponding author), Amphibian & Reptile Conservat, 655A Christchurch Rd, Bournemouth BH1 4AP, Dorset, England.",t.j.c.beebee@sussex.ac.uk,,,Nature Conservancy Council; Amphibian and Reptile Conservation; Amphibian Conservation Research Trust; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust; Esmee Fairbairn Foundation,"A huge number of people have contributed to the conservation of Britain's amphibians over the past 40 yr and without them this article would have been impossible.

Effects of neighbors on consumer-resource interactions (associational effects) occur in many systems, including plant-herbivore interactions, predator-prey interactions (mimicry), and plant-pollinator interactions. Unfortunately, we know little about how ecologically or evolutionarily important these effects are because we lack appropriate models and data to determine how neighbor effects on individuals contribute to net interactions at population and community levels. Here we supply a general definition of associational effects, review relevant theory, and suggest strategies for future theoretical and empirical work. We find that mathematical models from a variety of fields suggest that individual-level associational effects will influence population and community dynamics when associational effects create local frequency dependence. However, there is little data on how local frequency dependence in associational effects is generated, or on the form or spatial scale of that frequency dependence. Similarly, existing theory lacks consideration of nonlinear and spatially explicit frequency dependence. We outline an experimental approach for producing data that can be related to models to advance our understanding of how associational effects contribute to population and community processes.","[Underwood, Nora; Inouye, Brian D.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Hamback, Peter A.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Underwood, N (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",nunderwood@bio.fsu.edu; binouye@bio.fsu.edu; peter.hamback@su.se,"Hamback, Peter A/A-8194-2008","Hamback, Peter A/0000-0001-6362-6199",Fulbright Foundation; VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council [621-2009-4943]; NSF DEBNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0717221],"We thank Stockholm University and Florida State University for facilitating the discussions that led to this paper.

However, most studies have reported significant variation in successional patterns, particularly among replicate carcasses, which has complicated estimates of PMIs. Several forensic entomology researchers have proposed that further integration of ecological and evolutionary theory in forensic entomology could help advance the application of succession data for producing PMI estimates. The purpose of this essay is to draw attention to the role of spatial aggregation of arthropods among carrion resources as a potentially important aspect to consider for understanding and predicting the assembly of arthropods on carrion over time. We review ecological literature related to spatial aggregation of arthropods among patchy and ephemeral resources, such as carrion, and when possible integrate these results with published forensic literature. We show that spatial aggregation of arthropods across resources is commonly reported and has been used to provide fundamental insight for understanding regional and local patterns of arthropod diversity and coexistence. Moreover, two suggestions are made for conducting future research. First, because intraspecific aggregation affects species frequency distributions across carcasses, data from replicate carcasses should not be combined, but rather statistically quantified to generate occurrence probabilities. Second, we identify a need for studies that tease apart the degree to which community assembly on carrion is spatially versus temporally structured, which will aid in developing mechanistic hypotheses on the ecological factors shaping community assembly on carcasses.","[Fiene, Justin G.; Sword, Gregory A.; Tarone, Aaron M.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77845 USA; [Fiene, Justin G.] Elmhurst Coll, Dept Biol, Elmhurst, IL 60126 USA; [Vanlaerhoven, Sherah L.] Univ Windsor, Dept Biol Sci, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada","Fiene, JG (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77845 USA.",justin.fiene@net.elmhurst.edu,,"Tarone, Aaron/0000-0003-0965-7634",,,,58,14,14,0,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2585,1938-2928,,J MED ENTOMOL,J.

Based on forest soil survey data, we present a multivariate approach to identify the main parameters of FRD patterns of Central European forests, compare them with the FRD model according to Gale and Grigal (1987), and aim to detect the decisive site and soil properties. Two main parameters for the description of FRDs were found: one describes shallowness and the other additionally characterizes divergence from an evenly decreasing FRD with depth. With these two parameters, distinct FRD patterns could be described better than with absolute values of depth-dependent fine-root densities or with the compared FRD model. Comparing all sites, no significant differences occurred regarding stand types for most of the analysed fine-root parameters. Specific site and soil properties were seemingly more responsible for the expression of FRD. Results of multivariate analyses suggest that the shape of FRDs is mainly a reflection of the trees' strategy to optimally adapt to the local soil physical and hydrological conditions. Soil chemical properties were of increased relevance when sites with either spruce or beech were analysed and for the prediction of uneven FRDs. The applied soil survey design enabled us to identify parameters, which can describe FRD patterns and how they are influenced by several soil and site properties in general. These multivariate relationships should be considered and discussed in the context of ecological forest models in further research.","[Hartmann, Peter; von Wilpert, Klaus] Forest Res Inst Baden Wurttemberg, Dept Soils & Environm, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany","Hartmann, P (corresponding author), Forest Res Inst Baden Wurttemberg, Dept Soils & Environm, Wonnhaldestr 4, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany.",peter.hartmann@forst.bwl.de,"Hartmann, Peter/AAE-5586-2020",,,,,25,8,9,0,51,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0045-5067,1208-6037,,CAN J FOREST RES,Can.

We first obtained an ecogeographical favourability model for the Mediterranean pond turtle. We then modelled the presence/absence of the red-eared slider in the Mediterranean pond turtle range and obtained an encroachment favourability model. We also obtained a favourability model for the red-eared slider using the ecogeographical favourability for the Mediterranean pond turtle as a predictor. When favourability for the Mediterranean pond turtle was high, favourability for the red-eared slider was low, suggesting that in these areas the Mediterranean pond turtle may resist encroachment by the red-eared slider. We also calculated favourability overlap between the two species, which is their simultaneous favourability. Grids with low overlap had higher favourability values for the Mediterranean pond turtle and, consequently, were of lesser conservation concern. A few grids had high values for both species, being potentially suitable for coexistence. Grids with intermediate overlap had similar intermediate favourability values for both species and were therefore areas where the Mediterranean pond turtle was more vulnerable to encroachment by the red-eared slider. We mapped the favourability overlap to provide a map of vulnerability of the Mediterranean pond turtle to encroachment by the red-eared slider.","[Romero, David; Baez, Jose C.; Bellido, Jesus J.; Real, Raimundo] Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Baez, Jose C.] IEO, Inst Espanol Oceanog, Malaga 29016, Spain; [Ferri-Yanez, Francisco] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biogeog & Cambio Global, E-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Ferri-Yanez, Francisco] Int Cambio Global CSIC PUC LINCGlobal, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Bellido, Jesus J.] Aula del Mar Malaga, Malaga 29003, Spain","Romero, D (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",davidrp@uma.es,"Lopez, Juan Jesus Bellido/AAO-5354-2021; Baez, Jose C/I-2644-2013; Romero, David/H-7684-2015; Real, Raimundo/E-6559-2010","Lopez, Juan Jesus Bellido/0000-0002-4262-3551; Baez, Jose C/0000-0003-2049-0409; Romero, David/0000-0003-4540-6349; Real, Raimundo/0000-0002-6642-1284","Ministerio de EducacionGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [AP2007-03633]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, SpainSpanish Government [CGL2009-11316]; FEDEREuropean Commission","David Romero was supported by a Grant from the Ministerio de Educacion: AP2007-03633.

There was a positive correlation between the growth rate of aphids and the number of ants per shoot, suggesting ant attendance to aphids. Although the mean abundance of leaf shelters per shoot was rather low (1.7-2.2) throughout the observation period, aphids preferred to use shoots with leaf shelters compared with those without leaf shelters. The abundance of ants was positively influenced by the presence of leaf shelters and aphids from May to August. The abundance of other herbivores was positively influenced by leaf shelters, but negatively influenced by aphid presence from May to August. Furthermore, leaf shelters had a positive effect on the abundance of predators from July to October. These data suggest that a relatively low abundance of naturally occurring leaf shelters per shoot influenced the arthropod communities on S. eriocarpa, and the effect of those leaf shelters on each type of arthropod varied according to the season.","[Yoneya, Kinuyo; Inui, Yoko] Osaka Kyoiku Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Arts & Sci, Osaka 46981, Japan; [Ishihara, Michihiro] Osaka Prefectural Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Naka Ku, Sakai, Osaka 5998531, Japan; [Yoneya, Kinuyo; Takabayashi, Junji] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan","Yoneya, K (corresponding author), Osaka Kyoiku Univ, Fac Educ, Dept Arts & Sci, Osaka 46981, Japan.",yoneya@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Takabayashi, Junji/G-2212-2010","Takabayashi, Junji/0000-0002-3575-9952","Global Center of Excellence Program A06 'Formation of a Strategic Base for Biodiversity and Evolutionary Research: from Genome to Ecosystem' from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan; Core-to-Core project from Japan Science and Technology Agency, Japan; MEXT, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Foundation for Riverfront Improvement and Restoration; Grants for Excellent Graduate Schools from MEXT, Japan","This research was financially supported in part by Global Center of Excellence Program A06 'Formation of a Strategic Base for Biodiversity and Evolutionary Research: from Genome to Ecosystem' from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan, by the Core-to-Core project from Japan Science and Technology Agency, Japan, by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S) from MEXT, Japan, by the Foundation for Riverfront Improvement and Restoration, and by Grants for Excellent Graduate Schools from MEXT, Japan.",,24,2,2,0,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-9145,1742-9153,,J PLANT INTERACT,J.

In much of Europe, locust outbreaks have been considerably reduced by human pressure in recent decades, but important foci of outbreaks still exist in Spain. Distribution models are often used to derive spatial hypotheses and risk maps. Because insufficient information is available to include the extreme plasticity of the solitary and gregarious phases of locusts in large-scale spatial models, we modelled the distribution either of Acrididae species or of outbreaks per se. Confirmed occurrences of Dociostaurus, Calliptamus and Chorthippus species were obtained from a field survey complemented by museum collection data and the published literature. The locations of confirmed or potential outbreaks covering two time periods of 20years each were obtained from the literature and from Spanish autonomous community reports. Models were built with one topographic and eleven climatic predictors. We evaluated the ability of different models to predict outbreak recurrence and found that models based on Moroccan locust data or outbreak occurrence data performed the best. We generated a predictive map of the climatic favourability for locust outbreaks in Spain and found that the major foci of locust swarms were encompassed by those areas categorized by the models as areas of highest risk. Predictive maps of outbreak favourability can facilitate the more sustainable use of insecticides and more efficient integrated pest management.","[Aragon, P.; Lobo, J.

Although corridor structure maintenance is considered to be an essential tool for carnivore conservation in a human-dominated landscape, surprisingly little is known about the effects of different factors at various spatial scales. The main aim of this study was to determine how local and landscape-scale habitat characteristics and prey availability influence the corridor use by carnivores in a Central European agricultural landscape. Moreover we investigated carnivore corridor occurrence in two contrasting landscapes that differ in level of habitat loss and fragmentation to evaluate relative effect of species-specific response to regional context. Results show that the availability of principal prey (small mammals) was the most crucial factor affecting carnivore corridor use. Other important factors influencing corridor use were corridor width (positive), proportion of shrubs (positive) and presence of local, low-traffic, roads (positive). Single species models revealed interspecific and area-specific differences in carnivore preference at both spatial scales. Our findings confirm the general importance of multi-level approach to evaluating species-specific habitat requirements as a crucial tool for determining suitable methods for carnivore efficient conservation in human-dominated agricultural landscape.

The responses of folivorous insects to these changes is, however, highly variable. In this review we highlight emerging mechanisms by which increasing CO2 alters the defense chemistry and signaling of plants. The response of allelochemicals affecting insect performance varies under elevated CO2, and results suggest this is driven by changes in plant hormones. Increasing CO2 suppresses the production of jasmonates and ethylene and increases the production of salicylic acid, and these differential responses of plant hormones affect specific secondary chemical pathways. In addition to changes in secondary chemistry, elevated CO2 decreases rates of water loss from leaves, increases temperature and feeding rates, and alters nutritional content. New insights into the mechanistic responses of secondary chemistry to elevated CO2 increase our ability to predict the ecological and evolutionary responses of plants attacked by insects.","[Zavala, Jorge A.] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Fac Agron, Catedra Bioquim,INBA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Nabity, Paul D.; DeLucia, Evan H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61802 USA; [Nabity, Paul D.; DeLucia, Evan H.] Univ Illinois, Inst Genom Biol, Urbana, IL 61802 USA","Zavala, JA (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, Fac Agron, Catedra Bioquim,INBA, C1417DSE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",zavala@agro.uba.ar; pnabity2@illinois.edu; delucia@illinois.edu,,"Zavala, Jorge/0000-0001-6265-0920; Nabity, Paul/0000-0001-5430-5748",,,,154,109,113,2,131,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",0066-4170,1545-4487,978-0-8243-0158-3,ANNU REV ENTOMOL,Annu.

Birds in the genus Manorina are widely reported as being such species, and in highly disturbed or fragmented environments, and some intact environments, noisy miners Manorina melanocephala can have a strong negative effect on small passerine species via hyper-aggressive mobbing. The tropical savannas of northern Australia consist of largely unmodified woodlands, and two species of Manorina occur naturally in this region: the noisy miner and the yellow-throated miner Manorina flavigula. Therefore, what effect do these species have on bird assemblage in predominantly continuous habitats, relative to other typical determinants of avifauna assemblage such as vegetation structure? We used data collected from bird surveys at 511 sites across northern Queensland (179 noisy miner M. melanocephala sites, 332 yellow-throated miner M. flavigula sites) between 1998 and 2010. We examined the variation in bird composition at each site due to increasing abundance of Manorina spp. using uni- and multivariate techniques. We found total bird richness was significantly lower in sites where noisy and yellow-throated miner abundances were highest, and passerine species seemed most affected. For species, 45 species varied significantly in abundance with increasing miner numbers, and the overall effect of yellow-throated miners on other birds seemed more pronounced. However, vegetation structure was generally an equal or more important predictor of avifauna richness and abundance. We conclude that despite the superficially intact nature of northern Australian woodlands, pastoral intensification or poor land management might create disturbances that facilitate increases in the abundance of Manorina, causing localized overabundance and a compounding negative effect on other native bird species.","[Kutt, A.

In particular, a decline in pollinator visitation at low density can cause an Allee effect (a positive relation of fitness to density) in the plant population, which heightens that population's vulnerability to extinction. Empiricists have reported a variety of relations between flower or plant density and pollinator visitation rates. Here I develop and test a model that provides explanations for this diversity. The model assumes that pollinators distribute themselves between a focal patch of flowers and the surrounding environment so as to maximize foraging success. The resulting relation of per-flower visitation rate to focal-patch floral density is nonlinear, with positive effects at low floral densities and weaker or negative effects at higher densities. The relation is influenced by floral density in the surrounding environment and traits of both the plants and their pollinators. In a field experiment, floral density of Holocarpha virgata ssp. virgata had a nonlinear effect on per-flower visitation that was largely consistent with the model's predictions. By producing testable hypotheses based on biologically reasonable assumptions, this model serves as a starting point for explaining an important facet of plant-pollinator mutualisms.","Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Essenberg, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",carla.essenberg@email.ucr.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); University of California, RiversideUniversity of California System","I thank K.

Xenorhabdicin had not been characterized previously in other Xenorhabdus species. Here, we show xenorhabdicin production in six different strains of Xenorhabdus bovienii. The sequenced genome of X. bovienii SS-2004 was found to possess a highly conserved remnant P2-type cluster (xbp1). Inactivation of the xbpS1 sheath gene resulted in loss of bacteriocin activity, indicating that the xbp1 locus was required for xenorhabdicin production. xbp1 and xnp1 contain a CI-type repressor, a dinI gene involved in stabilization of ssDNA-RecA complexes and are inducible with mitomycin C, suggesting that both loci are regulated by cleavage of the CI repressor. Both xnp1 and xbp1 lack typical P2-type lysis genes but contain a predicted endolysin gene (enp) that may be involved in cell lysis. The main tail fibers of xnp1 and xbp1 are mosaic structures with divergent C-terminal regions suggesting they differ in host specificity. Several genes encoding C-terminal tail fiber fragments are present in the same position in xnp1 and xbp1. Recombination between the main fiber genes and the C-terminal fragments could potentially expand the host range specificity of xenorhabdicin in the respective strains.","[Morales-Soto, Nydia; Thappeta, Kishore R.

We study how adaptation affects range shifts when it involves multiple quantitative traits evolving in response to local selection pressures and gene flow. All traits develop clines shifting in space, some of which may be in a direction opposite to univariate predictions, and the species tracks its environmental optimum with a constant lag. We provide analytical expressions for the local density and average trait values. A species can sustain faster environmental shifts, develop a wider range and greater local adaptation when spatial environmental variation is low (generating low migration load) and multitrait adaptive potential is high. These conditions are favoured when nonlinear (stabilising) selection is weak in the phenotypic direction of the change in optimum, and genetic variation is high in the phenotypic direction of the selection gradient.","[Duputie, Anne; Chuine, Isabelle] Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut UMR 5175, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Duputie, Anne; Massol, Francois; Kirkpatrick, Mark] Univ Texas Austin, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Massol, Francois] Irstea, UR HYAX, F-13182 Aix En Provence 5, France; [Ronce, Ophelie] Univ Montpellier 2, Inst Sci Evolut CNRS UM2, Montpellier, France","Duputie, A (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut UMR 5175, Campus CNRS,1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",anne.duputie@ens-lyon.org,"Massol, Francois/D-9872-2013","Massol, Francois/0000-0002-4098-955X; Duputie, Anne/0000-0003-2213-7940","European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [TRECC-2009-237228, DEFTER-PLANKTON-2009-236712]; Axa Research Fund; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0819901]; French Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-09-PEXT-01102]","We are grateful to Y.

The aphid Uroleucon nigrotuberculatum Olive, which is specialised to the tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima L., in its native range, has become a dominant species on the introduced tall goldenrod in Japan. How this exotic aphid influenced arthropod communities on the introduced tall goldenrod in aphid-present (spring) and aphid-absent (autumn) seasons was examined, using an aphid removal experiment. 2. In spring, aphid presence increased ant abundance because aphid honeydew attracted foraging ant workers. A significant negative correlation was found between the numbers of ants and herbivorous insects other than aphids on the aphid-exposed plants, but no significant correlation was detected on the aphid-free plants. Thus, the aphid presence was likely to decrease the abundance of co-occurring herbivorous insects through removal behaviour of the aphid-tending ants. There were no significant differences in plant traits between the aphid-exposed and aphid-free plants. 3. In autumn, the numbers of lateral shoots and leaves, and the leaf nitrogen content were increased in response to the aphid infestation in spring. Because of the improvement of plant traits by aphid feeding, the abundance of leaf chewers increased on aphid-exposed plants. In contrast, the abundance of sap feeders decreased on the aphid-exposed plants. In particular, the dominant scale insect among sap feeders, Parasaissetia nigra Nietner, decreased, followed by a decrease in the abundance of ants attending P. nigra. Thus, aphid feeding may have attenuated the negative impacts of the tending ants on leaf chewers. 4. Aphid presence did not change herbivore species richness but changed the relative density of dominant herbivores, resulting in community-wide effects on co-occurring herbivores through ant-mediated indirect effects, and on temporally separated herbivores through plant-and ant-mediated indirect effects. The aphid also altered predator community composition by increasing and decreasing the relative abundance of aphid-tending ants in the spring and autumn, respectively.","[Ando, Yoshino; Ohgushi, Takayuki] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Shiga 5202113, Japan; [Utsumi, Shunsuke] Univ Tokyo, Dept Gen Syst Studies, Meguro Ku, Tokyo, Japan","Ando, Y (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, 509-3,2 Chome,Hiranocho, Shiga 5202113, Japan.",ando@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Frankel, Victor/F-7943-2011","Utsumi, Shunsuke/0000-0003-1558-8073","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [A-15207003, B-20370010];  [A14];  [A06]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [10J09260] Funding Source: KAKEN","We thank T.

Two species, the coypu (Myocastor coypus) and the common muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), are invasive. By contrast the native European beaver (Castor fiber) was extirpated from the region, subsequently reintroduced, and currently is protected. The aim of this study was to compare the ecological requirements of these three species and predict their future range distributions. We studied the relationship between the species and describe the characteristics of waterways and riparian vegetation in 29 sampling sites. Coypus and muskrats were observed in a variety of riparian habitats and their probability of detection appeared to be independent of waterway width, bank height or bank slope. The availability of numerous herbaceous plants, known to be consumed by these species, may facilitate their settlement. Muskrats are widespread on the French Ardennes waterways, but coypus have not yet colonised the northern part of the region. On the other hand, the beaver was observed primarily in the widest waterways with high banks, where woody plant species, such as Betula, Carpinus and Fraxinus, are found in abundance. Potentially favourable sites for beaver and coypu settlement were analysed to suggest appropriate management according to each species' status. However, the number of sample sites is weak, especially for sites with beaver, limiting our conclusion.","[Ruys, Thomas] Ctr Rech & Format Ecoethol, F-08240 Boult Aux Bois, France; [Ruys, Thomas; Marre, Alain] Univ Reims, GEGENA, F-51096 Reims, France; [Lorvelec, Olivier] INRA, Equipe Ecol Invas Biol, UMR Ecol & Sante Ecosyst 985, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Bernez, Ivan] INRA, Equipe Ecol & Sci Phytosanit, UMR Ecol & Sante Ecosyst 985, F-35042 Rennes, France","Ruys, T (corresponding author), Ctr Rech & Format Ecoethol, 2C2A,5 Rue Heronniere, F-08240 Boult Aux Bois, France.",thomasruys@wanadoo.fr; lorvelec@rennes.inra.fr; alain.marre@univ-reims.fr; bernez@agrocampus-ouest.fr,", AGROCAMPUS OUEST/O-6651-2016",", AGROCAMPUS OUEST/0000-0002-1800-4558",Conseil General des Ardennes; Conseil Regional de Champagne-ArdenneRegion Grand-Est,"The authors thank Marilyne Kneveler for her useful observations on riparian vegetation and Frances Bucquet, Ariane Duperon, Aude Loisier and Martin Schlaepfer for their last reading.

The effects of elevated CO2 on herbivore insects were found to be primarily through the CO2-induced changes occurring in their host plants, which then possibly affect the intensity and frequency of pest outbreaks on crops. This paper reviews several ongoing research models using primary pests of crops (cotton bollworm, whitefly, aphids) and their natural enemies (ladybeetles, parasitoids) in China to examine insect responses to elevated CO2. It is generally indicated that elevated CO2 prolonged the development of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, a chewing insect, by decreasing the foliar nitrogen of host plants. In contrast, the phloem-sucking aphid and whitefly insects had species-specific responses to elevated CO2 because of complex interactions that occur in the phloem sieve elements of plants. Some aphid species, such as cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii and wheat aphid, Sitobion avenae, were considered to represent the only feeding guild to respond positively to elevated CO2 conditions. Although whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, a major vector of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus, had neutral response to elevated CO2, the plants became less vulnerable to the virus infection under elevated CO2. The predator and parasitoid response to elevated CO2 were frequently idiosyncratic. These documents from Chinese scientists suggested that elevated CO2 initially affects the crop plant and then cascades to a higher trophic level through the food chain to encompass herbivores (pests), their natural enemies, pathogens and underground nematodes, which disrupt the natural balance observed previously in agricultural ecosystems.","[Sun, Yu-Cheng; Yin, Jin; Ge, Feng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest & Rodent, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Chen, Fa-Jun] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Dept Entomol, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Gang] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Plant Sci & Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China","Ge, F (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest & Rodent, 1 Beichen W Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",gef@ioz.ac.cn,,,"National Nature Science Fund of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [30970510, 31000854, 30921063]","We thank Professor Marvin Harris from Texas A&M University for reviewing the manuscript draft, and thank Drs.

Both biotic interactions and environmental fluctuations are key factors that can facilitate or disrupt coexistence. To better understand this interplay between these deterministic and stochastic forces, we develop a mathematical theory extending the nonlinear theory of permanence for deterministic systems to stochastic difference and differential equations. Our condition for coexistence requires that there is a fixed set of weights associated with the interacting populations and this weighted combination of populations' invasion rates is positive for any (ergodic) stationary distribution associated with a subcollection of populations. Here, an invasion rate corresponds to an average per-capita growth rate along a stationary distribution. When this condition holds and there is sufficient noise in the system, we show that the populations approach a unique positive stationary distribution. Moreover, we show that our coexistence criterion is robust to small perturbations of the model functions. Using this theory, we illustrate that (i) environmental noise enhances or inhibits coexistence in communities with rock-paper-scissor dynamics depending on correlations between interspecific demographic rates, (ii) stochastic variation in mortality rates has no effect on the coexistence criteria for discrete-time Lotka-Volterra communities, and (iii) random forcing can promote genetic diversity in the presence of exploitative interactions.

Stranded macroalgae exported from adjacent coastal ecosystems supports abundant intertidal consumers on oceanic sandy beaches, including talitrid amphipods, which can be one of the numerically dominant invertebrates of the upper shore. The allochthonous nature of this donor-controlled food subsidy and its unpredictable delivery by waves and currents, results in highly variable and potentially limiting resource availability for these consumers. In Chile, adults of the talitrid amphipod, Orchestoidea tuberculata Nicolet, can influence the survival of juvenile conspecifics through cannibalism, a type of intraspecific interaction we hypothesized could be affected by the availability of macroalgal resources. We experimentally investigated the potential influence of food availability on cannibalism between age classes in O. tuberculata in laboratory mesocosms. Juvenile mortality in presence of conspecific adults was significantly higher when juveniles and adults were maintained without food. However, adult mortality was neither density dependent or food dependent. Further, juveniles did not influence adult mortality, either with or without food. The strong effect of food limitation on juvenile mortality from cannibalism by adults of O. tuberculata found here, supports our hypothesis that food resource availability on beaches can affect this intraspecific interactions. In addition these results provide evidence of the potential importance of biological interaction in the population dynamics of intertidal consumers on oceanic sandy beaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

For proteins whose amino acid sequences evolve rapidly, it is unclear how such structural characteristics are retained biochemically. Here we address this question by focusing on ovulin, a prohormone that induces ovulation in Drosophila melanogaster females after mating. Ovulin is known to dimerize, and is one of the most rapidly evolving proteins encoded by the Drosophila genome. We show that residues within a previously hypothesized conserved dimerization domain (a coiled-coil) and a newly identified conserved dimerization domain (YxxxY) within ovulin are necessary for the formation of ovulin dimers. Moreover, dimerization is conserved in ovulin proteins from non-melanogaster species of Drosophila despite up to 80% sequence divergence. We show that heterospecific ovulin dimers can be formed in interspecies hybrid animals and in two-hybrid assays between ovulin proteins that are 15% diverged, indicating conservation of tertiary structure amidst a background of rapid sequence evolution. Our results suggest that because ovulin's self-interaction requires only small conserved domains, the rest of the molecule can be relatively tolerant to mutations. Consistent with this view, in comparisons of 8510 proteins across 6 species of Drosophila we find that rates of amino acid divergence are higher for proteins with coiled-coil protein-interaction domains than for non-coiled-coil proteins.

The study aimed to evaluate (1) the position of mire phytocoenoses in the environmental gradient - from minerotrophic to ombrotrophic ones, (2) the influence of the species and life-form composition of plant communities on the density of bryophytes, and (3) the quantitative and sociological relations between the density of vascular plants and bryophytes. Phytosociological releves (180) were made in six lakeland mires and in four river valleys. The area of each phytosociological releves (16-25 m(2)) represented species composition and vertical structure of communities. In the study of the relation vascular plants-bryophytes we took into consideration the following parameters: species abundance, cover of particular plant layers (trees, shrubs, herbs, bryophytes), and the number of species in particular life-form groups. In the LM the cover of particular layers was correlated negatively with the abundance of Sphagnum mosses. Betula pendula, B. pubescens and Frangula alnus overgrowing the LM affect negatively the abundance of some peat mosses. Less distinct relations were found between the tree density and bryophyte cover in the RM, but there is a positive correlation between the shrub cover and its predominant species - F. alnus - and the abundance of Polytrichum commune. Taking into account the relations between the herbaceous cover and the abundance of bryophytes, the dependencies are also less pronounced in the RM phytocoenoses. A negative effect of the herbaceous cover and its species richness on the abundance of P commune was observed, as well as positive relation between the number of herbaceous species and the abundance of Calliergonella cuspidata. In the LM phytocoenoses, a negative correlation was found in the case of S. palustre, while in the case of Aulacomnium palustre and S. cuspidatum the relations were positive. Among herbaceous plants of LM habitats the biggest number of statistically significant correlations were observed for abundance of Carex lasiocarpa and different bryophytes, while in the RM habitats the correlations between the abundance of bryophyte and vascular plant layers are less distinct.","[Sugier, Piotr; Czarnecka, Bozenna] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Dept Ecol, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland","Sugier, P (corresponding author), Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Dept Ecol, Akad 19, PL-20033 Lublin, Poland.",piotr.sugier@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl; bozenna.czarnecka@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl,,"Sugier, Piotr/0000-0002-1448-1517; Czarnecka, Bozenna/0000-0002-3532-6321",,,,47,4,4,0,10,POLISH ACAD SCIENCES INST ECOLOGY,LOMIANKI,"DZIEKANOW LESNY NEAR WARSAW, 05-092 LOMIANKI, POLAND",1505-2249,,,POL J ECOL,Pol.

However, the discussion on the beneficial or detrimental nature of interactions is clearly absent, or at the most, inadvertently merged into the strength debate. This deficiency is emerging with the increasing interest in theoretical studies of interactions that shift in their nature; e.g. associations that present a mixture of mutualistic and antagonistic aspects, such as pollination; or species with changes in role, such as mutualistic ants that predate on aphid partners. By exploring these models, major controversies are revealed underlying some traditional perspectives: the original Levins' community matrix reformulated into interaction and jacobian matrices, that is, interaction coefficients reinterpreted as partial derivatives, fail to recognize the ecological context of interactions. The 'effect of one species on the other' is not necessarily quantified by 'the effect of varying species densities'; and shifts in the signs of jacobian elements do not correspond to shifts in types of interaction but to stability properties. Thus, the generalised use of these approaches must be revised. On the other hand, the comparison of ultimate performances of populations when growing alone or in association, here referred to as the relative performance approach, conceptually represents the original meaning of the community matrix. This conception, although measured at population levels, is a reflection of properties at the individual level. This article inspects and discusses the formalities and ecological contexts of these approaches to characterization by means of known population interaction models: linear and non-linear, variable and non-variable; aiming to disentangle crucial conceptions that are usually mingled in the literature: the strength (magnitude) and the nature (detrimental or beneficial) of the interaction, which are sometimes used interchangeably, and the stability properties of the system, which have been misleadingly associated with the latter.

Only recently has it been appreciated that diversification might have proceeded quite differently for the two key diagnostic structures of this clade, flowers and fruits. These structures are hypothesized to have experienced different selective pressures via their interactions with animals in dispersal mutualisms, resulting in a greater amount of morphological diversification in animal-pollinated flowers than in animal-dispersed fruits. I tested this idea using size and colour traits for the flowers and fruits of 472 species occurring in three floras (St John, Hawaii and the Great Plains). Phylogenetically controlled analyses of nearest-neighbour distances in multidimensional trait space matched the predicted pattern: in each of the three floras, flowers were more divergent from one another than were fruits. In addition, the spacing of species clusters differed for flowers versus fruits in the flora of St John, with clusters in flower space more divergent than those in fruit space. The results are consistent with the idea that a major driver of angiosperm diversification has been stronger selection for divergent floral morphology than for divergent fruit morphology, although genetic, physiological and ecological constraints may also play a role.","Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Whitney, KD (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",kwhitney@rice.edu,"Whitney, Kenneth D/B-2971-2011","Whitney, Kenneth D/0000-0002-2523-5469",,,,52,18,18,0,46,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

We formalize and test the predictions for the role of ontogenetic mechanisms (e.g., hatching timing and size, juvenile developmental time, juvenile growth rate) in maintaining a longitudinal cline in adult body size of lubber grasshoppers [Romalea microptera (Beauvois)]. To obtain hatching timing and size, we collected eggs from wild females from several populations along the longitudinal gradient in 2 yr (2006 and 2007) and measured hatchling size and hatch date. To obtain juvenile developmental time and growth rates, we surveyed populations along the longitudinal gradient during 2 yr (2006 and 2007) and estimated developmental time and growth rates. We found the developmental time (hatching to fourth instar) and female growth rates increase from west to east along the cline. Patterns of hatching timing and hatching size were not consistent with the size cline. The size cline becomes evident in the third instar and is magnified in the fourth and fifth instars. Our data suggest that the size cline arises from some combination of clinal variation in developmental time and female growth rates; prolonged development and greater growth rates lead to larger mean size. Equally important, we found no evidence that differences in hatching time or size are ontogenetic causes of this cline. Our hypotheses for ontogenetic mechanisms producing an adult size cline should serve as a template for ecologists seeking to understand the ontogenetic basis of spatial variation in phenotypes.","[Jannot, Jason E.; Brinton, Jessica; Kocot, Kevin; Juliano, Steven A.] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, BEES Sect, Normal, IL 61790 USA; [Akman, Olcay] Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Dept Math, Normal, IL 61790 USA","Jannot, JE (corresponding author), Illinois State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, BEES Sect, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",jjannot@ilstu.edu,"Jannot, Jason/ABD-5400-2020","Jannot, Jason/0000-0002-9231-1337; Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553",National Science Foundation Cross-disciplinary Research at Undergraduate Institutions (CRUI)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-0442412],"We thank D.

They remain complex because of intrinsic variability in ecological measures from place to place and time to time, requiring care in their design and implementation. An experiment and its design can only be sensibly considered after thought and knowledge are used to make clear the logical basis for doing the experiment, so that its results can be interpreted in a robust and reliable manner. There are different approaches to any sequence of components of an experiment. Here, a falsificationist methodology is considered, which relates observations (things we know) to models (what we think explain the observations) to hypotheses (predictions about what will happen under novel circumstances if the model(s) is (are) correct). Experiments are then designed to create the novel circumstances in order to test the predictions. How an explicit framework influences the design of experiments is discussed, including the nature of replication and of controls for artefacts. Improving the match between natural historical and ecological knowledge and the interpretation of results of experiments will always help advance the discipline of ecology.","Univ Sydney, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Marine Ecol Labs A11, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Underwood, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Marine Ecol Labs A11, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",,,,,,,65,17,19,2,87,FINNISH ZOOLOGICAL BOTANICAL PUBLISHING BOARD,UNIV HELSINKI,"P O BOX 26, FI-00014 UNIV HELSINKI, FINLAND",0003-455X,,,ANN ZOOL FENN,Ann.

Intra-specific variation in plant defence traits has been shown to profoundly affect herbivore community structure. Here we describe two experiments designed to test whether similar effects occur at higher trophic levels, by studying pea aphid-natural enemy interactions in a disused pasture in southern England. 2. In the first experiment, the numbers and identity of natural enemies attacking different monoclonal pea aphid colonies were recorded in a series of assays throughout the period of pea aphid activity. 3. In the summer assay, there was a significant effect of clone on the numbers of aphidophagous hoverfly larvae and the total number of non-hoverfly natural enemies recruited. Clone also appeared to influence the attack rate suffered by the primary predator in the system, the hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus, by Diplazon laetatorius, an ichneumonid parasitoid. Colonies were generally driven to extinction by hoverfly attack, resulting in the recording of low numbers of parasitoids and entomopathogens, suggesting intense intra-guild predation. 4. To further examine the influence of clonal variation on the recruitment of natural enemies, a second experiment was performed to monitor the temporal dynamics of community development. Colonies were destructively sampled every other day and the numbers of natural enemies attacking aphid colonies were recorded. These data demonstrated that clonal variation influenced the timing, abundance, and identity of natural enemies attacking aphid colonies. 5. Taken together, these data suggest that clonal variation may have a significant influence on the patterns of interactions between aphids and their natural enemies, and that such effects are likely to affect our understanding of the ecology and biological control of these insect herbivores.","[Hazell, Steaphan P.; Fellowes, Mark D.

With both longitudinal data from a single social group, and cross-sectional data from multiple groups, we used fecal glucocorticoids (fGC) to examine potential stressors among spotted hyenas. Longitudinal data from adult members of a group living on the edge of the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, revealed that fGC concentrations were elevated during two periods of social upheaval among adults, especially among younger females; however, prey availability, rainfall, and presence of lions did not influence fGC concentrations among hyenas. Our results suggested that anthropogenic disturbance in the form of pastoralist activity, but not tourism, influenced fGC concentrations among adult male hyenas; rising concentrations of fGC among males over 12 years were significantly correlated with increasing human population density along the edge of the group's home range. As hyenas from this social group were frequently exposed to anthropogenic disturbance, we compared fGC concentrations among these hyenas with those obtained concurrently from hyenas living in three other groups undisturbed by pastoralist activity. We found that fGC concentrations from the undisturbed groups were significantly lower than those in the disturbed group, and we were able to rule out tourism and ecological stressors as sources of variation in fGC among the populations. Thus it appears that both social instability and anthropogenic disturbance, but not the ecological variables examined, elevate fGC concentrations and represent stressors for wild spotted hyenas. Further work will be necessary to determine whether interpopulation variation in stress physiology predicts population decline in groups exposed to intensive anthropogenic disturbance.

Along the east coast of Australia, the alga can also persist in mangroves as a free-living form trapped amongst pneumatophores. We investigated (1) whether the alga has an effect on molluscan species richness and abundance in mangroves similar to that on rocky shores, and (2) whether, in mangroves, the source (phenotypically distinct estuarine or rocky shore populations) of H. banksii influences the outcome of its interspecific interactions. Sampling of 3 rocky shore and 3 mangrove sites along the east coast of Australia revealed that patches of H. banksii consistently supported a greater species richness of molluscs than adjacent substratum. Whereas the alga increased the abundance of molluscs in the mangrove forest, it had no effect or decreased molluscan abundance on the rocky shore. Transplant of H. banksii from rocky shores and estuarine tidal flats into the mangrove indicated that the source of the algae influenced the magnitude of effects. Although all algae enhanced molluscan abundance and species richness, estuarine H. banksii, which had larger vesicles and a longer thallus, supported more molluscs of more species than rocky shore H. banksii. These results support the growing consensus that the influence of foundation species at the community level is dependent on environmental conditions. As human activities place increasing pressure on coastal ecosystems, it will be important to understand the mechanisms and conditions that determine community-level effects of foundation species so that biodiversity may be conserved.","[Bishop, Melanie J.; Morgan, Tara; Kelaher, Brendan P.; Hardstaff, Lyndle K.; Evenden, Robert W.] Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Bishop, Melanie J.; Morgan, Tara; Kelaher, Brendan P.; Hardstaff, Lyndle K.; Evenden, Robert W.] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water & Environm Resource Management, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Coleman, Melinda A.] Univ New S Wales, Ctr Marine Bioinnovat, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Bishop, MJ (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",mbishop@bio.mq.edu.au,"Coleman, Melinda A/R-5563-2016; Kelaher, Brendan/P-3647-2017","Coleman, Melinda A/0000-0003-2623-633X; Kelaher, Brendan/0000-0002-7505-4412; Bishop, Melanie/0000-0001-8210-6500",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"We thank B.

Different species may respond differently to habitat fragmentation, depending on species-specific traits such as body size, dispersal ability, mating system, and habitat requirement. The population sizes, extinction and recolonization frequencies of six naturally occurring land snail species (Cochlicopa lubrica, Vertigo pygmaea, Pupilla muscorum, Punctum pygmaeum, Helicella itala, and Trichia plebeia) were examined over 3 years in an experimentally fragmented nutrient-poor, calcareous grassland in the northern Swiss Jura mountains using a mark-recapture technique. Fragments of different size (0.25 m(2), 2.25 m(2), and 20.25 m(2)) were isolated by a 5-m wide strip of frequently mown vegetation. Control plots of corresponding size were situated in adjacent undisturbed grassland. Experimental grassland fragmentation influenced the population size in all snail species except H. itala, which is the species with the biggest shell and it is also active under mild conditions in winter. However, fragmentation affected different species to a different extent. Extinction (= disappearance from a plot) frequency increased with time, decreasing population size and decreasing plot size in all species. Large populations had a lower extinction probability than small populations. Fragmentation increased the probability of extinction, which also differed among snail species. The effect of plot size on extinction probability was still significant even after the effect of population size had been taken into account. Fragments and control plots did not differ in recolonization frequencies when all six species were considered. However, fragmentation influenced recolonization frequency when the two species with large shells (H. itala and T. plebeia) were excluded from the analysis. Our study shows that small-scale grassland fragmentation affects different land snail species to a different extent. This finding strengthens the claim for multi-species approaches to obtain general predictions of fragmentation impact.","[Stoll, Peter; Oggier, Peter; Baur, Bruno] Univ Basel, NLU, Sect Conservat Biol, Dept Environm Sci, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Stoll, P (corresponding author), Univ Basel, NLU, Sect Conservat Biol, Dept Environm Sci, St Johanns Vorstadt 10, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",peter.stoll@unibas.ch,"Stoll, Peter/A-8881-2010","Stoll, Peter/0000-0003-1509-1702",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission,"We thank S.

Population extinction is a fundamental ecological process. Recent experimental work has begun to test the large body of theory that predicts how demographic, genetic and environmental factors influence extinction risk. We review empirical studies of extinction conducted under controlled laboratory conditions. Our synthesis highlights four findings. First, extinction theory largely considers individual, isolated populations. However, species interactions frequently altered or even reversed the influence of environmental factors on population extinction as compared to single-species conditions, highlighting the need to integrate community ecology into population theory. 2. While most single-species studies qualitatively agree with theoretical predictions, studies are needed that quantitatively compare observed and predicted extinction rates. A quantitative understanding of extinction processes is needed to further advance theory and to predict population extinction resulting from human activities. 3. Many stresses leading to population extinction can be assuaged by migration between subpopulations. However, too much migration increases synchrony between subpopulations and thus increases extinction risk. Research is needed to determine how to strike a balance that maximizes the benefit of migration. 4. Results from laboratory experiments often conflict with field studies. Understanding these inconsistencies is crucial for extending extinction theory to natural populations.","[Griffen, Blaine D.; Drake, John M.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Griffen, BD (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",griffen@uga.edu,"Drake, John/D-6622-2012; Griffen, Blaine/AAC-6384-2021","Drake, John/0000-0003-4646-1235",,,,94,46,47,0,45,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Manual removals, cages or fences are classical methods, but they usually require large areas or multiple procedural controls to avoid experimental artefacts. In order to minimise some of those constraints, alternative methods have been developed and are increasingly being used. The effects and limitations of these methods are, however, generally assumed and hardly ever tested. The experiment described here was designed to compare the effectiveness of manual removals, copper paint and sticky barriers in excluding intertidal grazing gastropods from experimental areas on a natural sandstone platform in South-eastern Australia. The response of the grazing assemblage was evaluated for individual species and collectively (integrating all species) by direct counts of individuals and from radular marks on wax discs. The observed patterns varied considerably among species. As predicted, barriers of copper paint effectively excluded the limpet Cellana tramoserica, for several weeks, while having no apparent effect on co-occurring species of grazing gastropods. Sticky barriers were also effective in excluding C. tramoserica, but for shorter periods of time. Contrary to expectations, however, sticky barriers were generally incapable of deterring the coiled snails Bembicium nanum and Nerita atramentosa. Barriers of copper paint are, therefore, a cost-effective way to manipulate diversity (densities of individuals, number and composition of species) and function (intensity of grazing) in this type of assemblage. Care must be taken to clarify the underlying mechanisms and to identify adequate procedural controls. (C) 2008 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.","[Range, P.; Chapman, M. G.; Underwood, A.

The mixed culture consists of four bacterial strains (a cellulose-degrading anaerobe [strain S], a saccharide-utilizing anaerobe [strain F], a peptide- and acetate-utilizing aerobe [strain 3] and a peptide-, glucose-, and ethanol-utilizing aerobe [strain 5]). Interspecies interactions were examined by analyzing the effects of culture filtrates on the growth of the other strains and by comprehensively analyzing population dynamics in the mixed-culture systems with all possible combinations of the four bacterial strains. The persistence of strain S depends on the effects of strain 5. However, strain 5 is a disadvantaged strain because strain 3 has bacteriocidal activity on strain 5. The extinction of strain 5 is indirectly prevented by strain F that suppresses the growth of strain 3. Although strain F directly has suppressive effects on the growth of strain S, strain F is essential for the persistence of strain S, considering the indirect effects (maintaining strain 5, which is essential for the survival of strain S, by inhibiting strain 3). These indirect relationships form a bacterial network in which all the relationships including suppressive effects were well balanced to maintain the structural stability. In addition to direct metabolite interactions, such kind of indirect relationships could have a great impact on microbial community structure in the natural environment.","[Cui, Zong Jun] China Agr Univ, Coll Agron & Biotechnol, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Kato, Souichiro; Haruta, Shin; Ishii, Masaharu; Igarashi, Yasuo] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Biotechnol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Haruta, S (corresponding author), Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Biol Sci, 1-1 Minami Osawa, Tokyo 1920397, Japan.",sharuta@tmu.ac.jp,"Kato, Souichiro/M-4151-2018","Kato, Souichiro/0000-0002-2527-7730; Haruta, Shin/0000-0002-3705-2459",,,,36,58,64,1,52,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

Here, the sexual selection and ecological character displacement hypotheses ire compared. First, the coefficients of variation (Cvs) of pigmentation were compared against the CVs of a selected set of other animal's traits that are known to be maintained by either natural or sexual selection. Hetaerina americana, H. vulnerata, Calopteryx aequabilis, C. haemorrhoidalis and C xanthostoma were used in order to compare CVs. Second, it was predicted that pigmentation should not differ in spp. Whose populations are in sympatry (compared to allopatry) if sexual selection is driving the evolution of pigmentation (compared. for example to an ecological character displacement hypothesis in which pigmentation between spp. should differ). Here, the pigmentation of sympatric and allopatric populations of H. americana and H. vulnerata were compared. The study produced 2 main results. First, the CVs of pigmentation were not different from the CVs of sexually selected traits in other animals; nevertheless, they were different from those of naturally selected trails. Second, the pigmentation of the 2 spp. in sympatry did not differ significantly. The same was true for allopatric populations. Taken together. these results suggest that sexual selection is the main mechanism of maintenance of pigmentation in these animals. Other alternative hypotheses tor the evolution of pigmentation (differences in habitat use in both sexes, warning to predators by male male and ecological character displacement) are discussed in the light of these results.","[Serrano-Meneses, M.

That many landscapes have been altered by humans, creating habitat suitable for non-native species, helps explain this apparent paradox. We asked whether the abundance of native Douglas (Tomiasciurus douglasii (Bachman, 1839)) and northern flying (Glaucomys sabrinus (Shaw, 1801)) squirrels was best explained by the abundance of non-native eastern grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis Gmelin, 1788), the proportion of urban development, or both using available squirrel abundance data from wildlife shelters and land-use maps. There was no evidence that non-native squirrels replaced native squirrels given that their abundances were positively related, whereas native squirrels varied negatively with the amount of development. The best model explaining variation in the abundance of Douglas and northern flying squirrels incorporated both eastern grey squirrels and development, which is consistent with the-hypothesis that regional declines in native squirrels are more likely to be predicated by the alteration of native conifer habitats by humans independent of the effects of non-native squirrels.","[Gonzales, E.

Asterropteryx semipunctatus had the widest distribution and was the most abundant species in each habitat zone, followed by Amblygobius bynoensis, Valenciennea muralis and Amblygobius phalaena. Significant temporal and spatial differences in mean density were evident. The highest density of A. semipunctatus (312 individuals 10 m(-2)) was recorded in a habitat zone dominated by algal-covered rubble, whereas A. bynoensis and V. muralis were most abundant (mean summer density 5.5-5.8 individuals 10 m(-2)) in habitats containing both sand and hard substrata. In contrast, A. phalaena was uncommon (mean density <= 0.4 individuals 10 m(-2)) in all four habitat zones. Significant seasonal differences in abundance were due to the large influx of recruits in summer. Ontogenetic shifts in habitat use were not evident at either the macrohabitat (i.e. among habitat zones) or microhabitat scale (i.e. substratum use within zones). At the microhabitat scale, V. muralis consistently exhibited a strong positive association with sand and was rarely associated with hard substrata. In contrast, the two Amblygobius species were commonly associated with both sand and hard substrata, but patterns of microhabitat use differed among habitat zones. Substratum composition at the microhabitat scale may influence spatial patterns of abundance at larger spatial scales by providing essential resources and, or influencing carrying capacity and predation risk.","[Hernaman, V.; Probert, P.

Tree squirrels are ideal models to study these relationships, since both key demographic parameters (reproduction, survival and dispersal) and spatio-temporal variation in food supplies (measured as seed-crop size) can be reliably estimated. In this paper we test the following two predictions underlying the association between annual food abundance and demography in six alpine red squirrel populations, both with and without time-lag effects: 1) between-season and between-year fluctuations in survival rate, population density and increase parallel those in food availability; and 2) individuals follow a resource tracking strategy and increase in density mainly the year after a rich seed-crop. Red squirrels occurred at higher densities in Scots pine forest, characterised by stable seed-crops, than in Norway spruce with more abundant but more variable seed crops. Fluctuations in numbers were positively correlated with food availability, measured as annual conifer seed-crop sizes. Overall, adult survival rates were higher than those of subadults, and survival substantially fluctuated between seasons and years. Autumn densities and rates of population increase (summer-autumn) were strongly correlated with the same year's autumn seed-crop, while correlations with the previous year's seed-crop (time-lag models) were either weak (population density) or absent (population increase). Results of this paper show that fluctuations in red squirrel densities in habitats with strong temporal variation in seed production are more closely linked with food availability than in more stable habitats. In addition, in the Alpine conifer forests squirrel population sizes, in autumn, increase in synchrony with food resources, eliminating the population lag normally present when resources are produced in pulses.","[Wauters, Lucas A.] Univ Insubria Varese, Dept Environm Hlth Safety, IT-21100 Varese, Italy; [Wauters, Lucas A.; Githiru, Mwangi] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Lab Anim Ecol, BE-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Githiru, Mwangi] Natl Museums Kenya, Dept Ornithol, Nairobi, Kenya; [Bertolino, Sandro] Univ Turin, DIVAPRA Entomol & Zool, IT-10095 Grugliasco, TO, Italy; [Molinari, Ambrogio] Univ Insubria Varese, Dept Environm Hlth Safety, IT-21100 Varese, Italy; [Lens, Luc] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Terr Ecol Unit, BE-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Wauters, LA (corresponding author), Univ Insubria Varese, Dept Environm Hlth Safety, Via JH Dunant 3, IT-21100 Varese, Italy.",l.wauters@uninsubria.it,"Bertolino, Sandro/V-5508-2019","Lens, Luc/0000-0002-0241-2215; Wauters, Lucas Armand/0000-0002-7012-9200; Wauters, Lucas/0000-0002-4871-5035",,,,75,59,61,2,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,1600-0587,,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,FEB,2008,31,1,,,,,104,114,,10.1111/j.2007.0906-7590.05251.x,,,11,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,266ZN,WOS:000253477500013,,,,,2021-09-21,

We calculated microhabitat and diet niche breadths with data from 14 isolated Cerrado patches and Amazon savanna areas and six central Cerrado populations. Morphological data were compared using average Euclidean distances, and lizard abundance was estimated using the number of lizards captured in pitfall traps over an extended time period. We found no evidence of ecological release with respect to microhabitat use, suggesting that historical factors are better microhabitat predictors than ecological factors. However, data from individual stomachs indicate that ecological release occurs in these areas for one species (Tropidurus) but not others (Ameiva ameiva, Anolis, Cnemidophorus, and Micrablepharus), suggesting that evolutionary lineages respond differently to environmental pressures, with tropidurids being more affected by ecological factors than polychrotids, teiids, and gymnophthalmids. We found no evidence that ecological release occurs in these areas using morphological data. Based on abundance data, our results indicate that the ecological release (density compensation) hypothesis is not supported: lizard species are not more abundant in isolated areas than in nonisolated areas. The ecology of species is highly conservative, varying little from assemblage to assemblage. Nevertheless, increases in niche breadth for some species indicate that ecological release occurs as well.","Univ Brasilia, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Zool, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; Univ Oklahoma, Sam Noble Oklahoma Mus, Nat Hist & Zool Dept, Norman, OK 73072 USA","Mesquita, DO (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Inst Ciencias Biol, Dept Zool, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",danmesq@unb.br,"Mesquita, Daniel Oliveira/P-1629-2019; Mesquita, Daniel/I-5007-2012; Colli, Guarino Rinaldi/A-5368-2008","Mesquita, Daniel Oliveira/0000-0002-8174-6837; Mesquita, Daniel/0000-0002-8174-6837; Colli, Guarino Rinaldi/0000-0002-2628-5652",,,,73,20,24,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,AUG,2007,153,1,,,,,185,195,,10.1007/s00442-007-0725-z,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,192AJ,WOS:000248172800019,17437128,,,,2021-09-21,

The explanation most amenable with ecological theory is that different guild members are adapted for exploiting the different opportunities offered by such macrohabitats. Morphological characters are possible adaptations reflecting habitat preferences. We investigated morphological traits in a guild of small foliage-gleaning, insectivorous birds breeding in central Ontario, Canada (4 families; 23 species). We measured 27 skeletal features and compared 2 types of differences: those between conspecific sexes (that by necessity occupy the same macrohabitat) and those between different guild members (that tend to occupy different macrohabitats). We predicted that if macrohabitat differences are reflected in different morphologies, the differences between conspecific sexes would be less than the differences between species, at least after correcting for size. We used (a) principal components analysis (PCA), (b) distance matrices derived from PCA scores, and (c) Mantel tests. Although conspecific male and female morphologies were correlated, nearest neighbours in morphological space were frequently non-conspecifics. Accordingly, because morphological differences between similar species that tend to occupy different macrohabitats are often smaller than morphological differences between conspecific sexes, our findings indicate that skeletal morphology provides no basis for explaining patterns of within-guild macrohabitat segregation.","Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada","Mills, AM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",amills@zoo.utoronto.ca,,,,,,60,0,0,0,14,UNIVERSITE LAVAL,ST FOY,"PAVILLON CHARLES-EUGENE MARCHAND, LOCAL 0166, ST FOY, QUEBEC G1K 7P4, CANADA",1195-6860,,,ECOSCIENCE,Ecoscience,,2007,14,2,,,,,155,164,,10.2980/1195-6860(2007)14[155:LOEAIE]2.0.CO;2,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,182EO,WOS:000247488100003,,,,,2021-09-21,

Physiology and its environmental forcing functions are assumed to affect both the total time available for activity and foraging and the resource budgets by affecting resource acquisition, costs, and handling. We extend the earlier model of Dunham and others (1989) and translate it into a computational algorithm. To satisfy conservation needs for accuracy, wide applicability, and rapid deployment, the model is relatively simple, uses as much data on the focal organism as possible, is mechanistically driven, and can be adapted to new organisms by using data for the new species, or the best available approximations to those data. We present 2 applications of the modeling approach. First, we consider a system with substantial information available, canyon lizards (Sceloporus merriami) studied by Dunham and colleagues in west Texas. In this case the focus is on integration of numerous inputs and the ability of the model to produce predictions that approximate counterintuitive empirical patterns. By using the wealth of specific data available, the model outperforms previous attempts at explanation of those patterns. Next, we consider a system with much less available information (forest-dwelling semi-fossorial frogs). The question here is how hydric conditions can become limiting. A model of evaporation from frogs buried in leaf litter was incorporated and it demonstrates how rainfall patterns can both supply water and put the frogs at risk of critical dehydration.","Drexel Univ, Dept Biosci & Biotechnol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; Univ Penn, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","O'Connor, MP (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Dept Biosci & Biotechnol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",mike.oconnor@drexel.edu,"Sieg, Annette/M-8644-2014",,,,,79,16,17,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1540-7063,1557-7023,,INTEGR COMP BIOL,Integr.

Our hypothesis was that degraded habitats would have reduced vegetation complexity, richness, and abundance, and consequently lower reptile species richness and abundance. We also hypothesized that desert lizards would not follow the typical generalist/specialist responses to habitat degradation found in other biomes. Instead, we predicted that because vegetation loss intensifies the environmental extremity of deserts, those species specialized for open and sandy environments would be more likely to persist in desertified habitats than would desert generalists. our results showed that areas protected from vegetation loss did not have significantly higher vegetation richness or abundance except for only a few species. However, protected sites did have significantly higher percent vegetation cover and height. Habitat protection clearly had strong effects on the reptile community as species richness and abundances were significantly higher in protected sites. The composition of the reptile community between protected and unprotected sites differed significantly. Contrary to past studies in other environments, desert generalist species were not able to persist in degraded sites and were only found in protected sites. Specialist species were ubiquitous in that they occurred in both areas protected and unprotected from vegetation loss. We propose that the effects of disturbance on species composition (specialists or generalists) depends on whether the disturbance exacerbates or reduces environmental harshness and the conditions that favor specialization. In extreme environments, specialist and generalist responses to habitat degradation are opposite to that of more productive environments. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We studied patterns of small-scale habitat use by darkling and ground beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae and Carabidae) in a two-phase shrub steppe mosaic, in NW Patagonia, Argentina. Beetles were sampled using pitfall traps during the early (December-January) and late (February-March) activity season (3675 trap-days). Traps were placed in three microsites: shrub centre, shrub periphery and off-shrub bare-soil areas. We also experimentally tested effects of aerial cover and litter accumulation, two key features of shrub patches, on beetle activity and assemblage structure. We captured 1415 individuals, the majority being omnivorous tenebrionids (67%) and predaceous carabids (28%). All recorded species (five tenebrionids plus two carabids) occurred in all three microsites and in both trapping seasons. Overall beetle activity, biomass and diversity were consistently greater in shrub microsites than in bare-soil areas. Mean diurnal soil temperatures were higher in bare soil (37.6 degrees C) than beneath shrubs (23.6 degrees C). Tenebrionid activity decreased markedly in the late season, coinciding with the increased frequency of daily maximum soil temperatures over 30 degrees C (shrub) and 50 degrees C (bare soil). Carabid activity did not vary with season, reflecting a shift in species dominance not found among tenebrionids. Addition of artificial shelters to bare-soil patches revealed differing perceptions of microhabitat cover by beetle groups, carabids being less selective than tenebrionids. In contrast, litter manipulation did not significantly alter microhabitat use by beetles. We conclude that shrubs act as 'keystone structures' providing sheltered habitat to ground-dwelling macro arthropods. Thus, disturbances and management actions altering shrub cover may have unwanted, community-wide impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem processes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence of prey selectivity was found but high levels of overlap, particularly in prey size, reflected the abundance of invertebrates in field samples. Despite similarities in diets between all four species, evidence of niche differentiation was found in terms of foraging mode and prey composition. Neomys ate predominantly terrestrial prey but 20% of prey of N. fodiens was aquatic (compared with 11% in N. anomalus), with Asellus being the dominant aquatic prey. Sorex shrews were exclusively terrestrial in foraging mode. All species ate predominantly small prey (<= 5 mm) and these were most abundant in field samples, but small prey were most important for S. minutus. Pairwise comparisons suggested that the most important promoter of resource partitioning was body size, indicating different foraging modes. Food niche overlap was least between species most dissimilar in size. The tiny S. minutus was predominantly an epigeal forager on small Araneae, Opiliones and Coleoptera; the medium-sized S. araneus fed extensively on Lumbricidae and Coleoptera; and the large, semi-aquatic Neomys fed on different amounts of freshwater prey in addition to terrestrial prey. Our results support the prediction that microhabitat selection among these species indicates differentiation in foraging mode.","Kings Coll London, Dept Biochem, London SE1 9NH, England; Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, Bialowieza, Poland","Churchfield, S (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Biochem, 150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England.",sara.churchfield@kcl.ac.uk,"Rychlik, Leszek/B-2956-2013","Rychlik, Leszek/0000-0002-1479-1443",,,,58,53,58,0,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0952-8369,1469-7998,,J ZOOL,J.

Many species of delphinids co-occur in space and time. However, little is known of their ecological interactions and the underlying mechanisms that mediate their coexistence. 2. Snubfin Orcaella heinsohni, and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins Sousa chinensis, live in sympatry throughout most of their range in Australian waters. I conducted boat-based surveys in Cleveland Bay, north-east Queensland, to collect data on the space and habitat use of both species. Using Geographic Information Systems, kernel methods and Euclidean distances I investigated interspecific differences in their space use patterns, behaviour and habitat preferences. 3. Core areas of use (50% kernel range) for both species were located close to river mouths and modified habitat such as dredged channels and breakwaters close to the Port of Townsville. Foraging and travelling activities were the dominant behavioural activities of snubfin and humpback dolphins within and outside their core areas. 4. Their representative ranges (95% kernel range) overlapped considerably, with shared areas showing strong concordance in the space use by both species. Nevertheless, snubfin dolphins preferred slightly shallower (1-2 m) waters than humpback dolphins (2-5 m). Additionally, shallow areas with seagrass ranked high in the habitat preferences of snubfin dolphins, whereas humpback dolphins favoured dredged channels. 5. Slight differences in habitat preferences appear to be one of the principal factors maintaining the coexistence of snubfin and humpback dolphins. I suggest diet partitioning and interspecific aggression as the major forces determining habitat selection in these sympatric species.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Trop Environm Studies & Geog, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; CRC, Reef Res Ctr, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia","Parra, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Vet Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",g.parra@uq.edu.au,,"Parra, Guido J./0000-0002-1284-4898",,,,69,93,104,3,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The intertidal limpet Collisella scabra experiences a 100-fold decline in abundance over the northernmost 300 km of its range. Temperature and food supply both strongly influenced individual survival, growth, and maturation. Regression analysis also revealed significant interactions among these conditions: the effect of one could not be predicted without knowing the level of the other. But these relationships could not explain geographic abundance patterns. Instead, individual limpets were highly successful at sites with relatively low abundance. These results suggest that, even though temperature is important to the success of individual C. scabra populations, the primary effect of warming temperatures under climate change may not be a shift in geographic distribution.","Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Gilman, SE (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Labs, 620 Univ Rd, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA.",gilmans@u.washington.edu,,,,,,64,38,38,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,2006,148,2,,,,,270,279,,10.1007/s00442-006-0372-9,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,055BR,WOS:000238425500010,16477473,,,,2021-09-21,

Plots of local species richness versus regional species pools have been used to address this question, yet after an active quarter-century of research on the relative influence of local interactions versus regional species pools, consensus remains elusive. We propose a conceptual framework that incorporates spatial scale and ecological interaction strength to reconcile current disparities. We then test this framework using a survey of marine rocky intertidal algal and invertebrate communities from the northeast Pacific. We reach two main conclusions. First, these data show that the power of regional species pools to predict local richness disintegrates at small spatial scales coincident with the scale of biological interactions, when studying ecologically interactive groups of species, and in generally more abiotically stressful habitats ( e. g., the high intertidal). Second, conclusions of past studies asserting that the regional species pool is the primary driver of local species richness may be artifacts of large spatial scales or ecologically noninteractive groups of species.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Ohio State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Aquat Ecol Lab, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Russell, R (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA.",roly@fulbrightweb.org; wood@zoology.ubc.ca; allison.100@osu.edu; mengeb@oregonstate.edu,"Menge, Bruce/I-6571-2012; Wood, Spencer A/A-3603-2009",,,,,74,40,40,0,26,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

The gradient in pond canopy cover strongly influences freshwater species distributions. This study tested the effects of canopy cover on the performance of two species of larval anurans, a canopy cover generalist (Rana sylvatica, the wood frog) and an open-canopy specialist (R. pipiens, the leopard frog), and tested which factors co-varying with canopy cover mediate these effects. 2. A field transplant experiment demonstrated that canopy cover had negative performance effects on both species. However, leopard frogs, which grow faster than wood frogs in open-canopy ponds, were more strongly affected by closed-canopy pond conditions. 3. Closed-canopy ponds had lower temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and food nutritional quality as indicated by carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C : N) analysis of field-sampled food types, and of gut contents of transplanted larvae. 4. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that higher temperature and food quality but not DO substantially increased larval growth. However, only food quality increased growth rates of leopard frogs more than wood frogs. 5. The strong correlation of growth rates to gut content C : N in the field, and the similarity of growth curves as a function of resource quality in the field and laboratory, strongly suggest that resources are of primary importance in mediating intraspecific, and especially interspecific differences in performance across the canopy cover gradient.","Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Schiesari, L (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Arts Sci & Humanities, EACH, Av Arlindo Betio 1000,Parque Ecol Tiete, BR-03828080 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",lschiesa@usp.br,"Schiesari, Luis C/E-8624-2012","Schiesari, Luis C/0000-0003-0814-591X",,,,30,89,90,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Janzen derived a simple climatic-physiological model predicting that tropical mountain passes would be more effective barriers to organismal dispersal than would temperate-zone passes of equivalent altitude. This prediction derived from a recognition that the annual variation in ambient temperature at any site is relatively low in the tropics. Such low variation within sites not only reduces the seasonal overlap in thermal regimes between low- and high-altitude sites, but should also select for organisms with narrow physiological tolerances to temperature. As a result, Janzen predicted that tropical lowland organisms are more likely to encounter a Mountain pass as a physiological barrier to dispersal (hence higher), which should in turn favor smaller distributions and an increase in species turnover along altitudinal gradients. This synthetic hypothesis has long been at the center of discussions of latitudinal patterns of physiological adaptation and of species diversity. Here we review some of the key assumptions and predictions of Janzen's hypothesis. We find general support for many assumptions and predictions, but call attention to several issues that somewhat ameliorate the generality of Janzen's classic hypothesis.","Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Ghalambor, CK (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",cameron1@lamar.colostate.edu,"Huey, Raymond B./F-1597-2010; Ghalambor, Cameron/V-4486-2019","Ghalambor, Cameron/0000-0003-2515-4981",,,,107,479,483,4,205,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1540-7063,1557-7023,,INTEGR COMP BIOL,Integr.

Six species (Chaetodon aureofasciatus, C. baronessa, C. lunulatus, C. plebius, C. rainfordi and C. trifascialis) fed almost exclusively on scleractinian corals, and a further eight species (C. citrinellus, C. kleinii, C. lunula, C. melannotus, C. rafflesi, C. speculum, C. ulietensis, and C. unimaculatus) took a significant proportion of their bites from corals. The other six species (C. auriga, C. ephippium, C. lineolatus, C. semeion, C. vagabundus, and Chelmon rostratus) rarely consumed coral, but fed on small discrete prey items from non-coral substrates. Coral-feeding butterflyfishes consumed a wide range of corals. Chaetodon lunulatus, for example, consumed 51 coral species from 24 different genera. However, there was up to 72% dietary overlap between coral-feeding butterflyfishes, with 11/14 species feeding predominantly on Acropora hyacinthus or Pocillopora damicornis. The most specialised corallivore, C. trifascialis, took 88% of bites from A. hyacinthus. Chaetodon trifascialis defend territories encompassing one or more colonies of A. hyacinthus, and may have prevented other species such as C. lunulatus from feeding even more extensively on this coral. This study has shown that coexistence of coral-feeding butterflyfishes occurs despite an apparent lack of partitioning of prey resources. While different coral-feeding butterflyfishes were more or less selective in their use of different coral prey, virtually all species fed predominantly on A. hyacinthus or P. damicornis.","James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Pratchett, MS (corresponding author), James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Ctr Coral Reef Biodivers, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",morgan.pratchett@jcu.edu.au,"Pratchett, Morgan/AAW-5179-2020; Pratchett, Morgan S/A-9256-2010","Pratchett, Morgan/0000-0002-1862-8459; Pratchett, Morgan S/0000-0002-1862-8459",,,,28,150,155,0,71,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

Because up-slope migration of lowland species may accompany global warming and earlier snowmelt, I tested whether crowding by neighbors vs. timing of snowmelt limit Potentilla diversifolia to later-melting sites in the Rocky Mountains (U.S.A.). I transplanted individuals from two altitudes to experimental plots within and below the species' range limit, and experimentally altered snowmelt timing and the density of neighboring vegetation. In contrast to theoretical predictions for biotic control of lower range limits, higher temperatures and drier soils contributed to markedly reduced survivorship and reproduction below the native-range regardless of treatment. Neighbor removal only marginally increased performance both within and below the native-range, suggesting that interactions with neighboring vegetation are much less important for distribution than abiotic factors. Populations from the subalpine zone had longer growth intervals and grew larger than those from the alpine tundra in their native sites, but did not outperform alpine tundra populations when grown below the species' range. Although earlier snowmelt enhances growth, phenotypic plasticity may enable P. diversifolia to persist in later-melting tundra sites while higher temperatures and drought restrict it from much of the subalpine zone.","Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA","Stinson, KA (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",kstinson@oeb.harvard.edu,,,,,,52,17,17,0,19,INST ARCTIC ALPINE RES,BOULDER,"UNIV COLORADO, BOULDER, CO 80309 USA",1523-0430,,,ARCT ANTARCT ALP RES,Arct.

I assess the relative importance of regional (dispersal) and local (abiotic and biotic environmental variation) processes in explaining the structure of a freshwater pond metacommunity. Results did not support the hypothesis that dispersal was limited by interpatch distance. Instead, community diversity, composition, and trophic structure were best explained by local environmental variation associated with pond permanence. Many taxa were restricted either to temporary or semipermanent ponds, an outcome that suggests species trade off adaptations to disturbance with those to biotic interactions (species-sorting model) and that refutes the neutral model of interspecific equivalence. However, evidence for high dispersal rates, low-fitness habitats, and high temporal environmental variability indicated that interpatch dispersal also may influence local dynamics through mass effects. These results suggest that integrating the species-sorting and mass-effect niche assembly frameworks will provide a necessary step in the successful application of metacommunity theory.","Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Urban, MC (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 370 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",mark.urban@yale.edu,"Urban, Mark Christopher/Y-2430-2019",,,,,45,155,162,5,109,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2004,85,11,,,,,2971,2978,,10.1890/03-0631,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,873EW,WOS:000225263500007,,,,,2021-09-21,

We compared the seasonal timing and magnitude of investment in diapausing eggs and their subsequent storage in the sediment among Daphnia species from both temporary ponds (Daphnia pulex and Daphnia ephemeralis) and permanent lakes (Daphnia pulicaria and Daphnia dentifera). Species exhibited strong temporal segregation in the timing of diapausing eggs production in both temporary and permanent systems. All populations of D. ephemeralis produced ephippia in early April whereas D. pulex and D. pulicaria produced the majority of ephippia in May-June and D. dentifera did not produce males or ephippia until autumn. Maximum investment in dormant clutches (as opposed to immediately hatching eggs) was always 100% in the temporary pond species but ranged from 3% to 100% among populations living in the lakes. The number of eggs stored in the egg bank varied within and among species but was usually lower in the temporary pond species. Our results indicate that the use of dormancy in Daphnia varies considerably among populations and species and that whether the system is temporary or permanent is not necessarily a good predictor of a population's investment in dormancy.","Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Michigan State Univ, Wk Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA","Caceres, CE (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Sch Integrat Biol, 515 Morrill Hall, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",caceres@life.uiuc.edu,,,,,,45,64,70,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0024-3590,1939-5590,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR,Limnol.

On the southern shore of the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary, the polychaetes Nereis virens (Nereidae) and Nephtys caeca (Nephtyidae) represent the main infaunal predators and are known to regulate (by predation) other populations within their community. For these animal populations, there is a high degree of spatial overlap in the horizontal dimension as well as vertically in the sediment column. The purpose of this study was to describe and compare the feeding activity of N. virens and N. caeca in relation to several environmental factors. The feeding activity of N. caeca was further studied under natural and experimental conditions and a feeding experiment was carried out to evaluate how the food resource is subdivided in conditions of high spatial overlap. Finally, the prospecting activity of N. virens was described under natural conditions. N. virens and N. caeca exhibited a high degree of dietary overlap, particularly at the adult stage. This food resource overlap can easily influence the regulation of these species, even though they display different feeding responses to environmental stimuli. Tides and storm events can also influence the feeding behaviour. We conclude that different behavioural feeding responses likely favour the occurrence of these two species in the same trophic environment. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Such a cross-resistance, called immunization or vaccination, can benefit the plant, if the fitness consequences of attack from the initial attacker are less than those from subsequent attackers. Here, we report an example of naturally occurring vaccination of the native tobacco plant, Nicotiana attenuata, against Manduca hornworms by prior attack from the mirid bug, Tupiocoris notatus (Dicyphus minimus), which results from the elicitation of two categories of induced plant responses. First, attack from both herbivore species causes the plants in nature to release predator-attracting volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the attracted generalist predator, Geocoris pallens, preferentially attacks the less mobile hornworm larvae. Second, attack from both mirids and hornworms increases the accumulation of secondary metabolites and proteinase inhibitors (PIs) in the leaf tissue, which is correlated with the slow growth of Manduca larvae. Mirid damage does not significantly reduce the fitness of the plant in nature, whereas attack from the hornworm reduces lifetime seed production. Consequently, plants that are attacked by mirids realize a significant fitness advantage in environments with both herbivores. The combination of growth-slowing direct defenses and predator-attracting indirect defenses results in greater hornworm mortality on mirid-attacked plants and provides the mechanism of the vaccination phenomenon.","Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Mol Ecol, D-07745 Jena, Germany","Baldwin, IT (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Chem Ecol, Dept Mol Ecol, Hans Knoll Str 8, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",Baldwin@ice.mpg.de,"Baldwin, Ian T/K-1809-2013; Kessler, Andre/C-7810-2014","Kessler, Andre/0000-0002-1797-7518; Baldwin, Ian/0000-0001-5371-2974",,,,42,155,167,0,75,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-7412,1365-313X,,PLANT J,Plant J.,MAY,2004,38,4,,,,,639,649,,10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02076.x,,,11,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,818FU,WOS:000221231800007,15125770,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

Their population dynamics were explored along an environmental gradient that encompasses the range limits of the two species. Matrix population models were constructed to provide estimates of population growth rate (lambda) at various sites. 2 Contrary to expectation no decline in lambda was observed for populations of either species at their distribution limit. Density-independent models gave values considerably in excess of unity at the range margin of both species, indicating potential for expansion into each other's range. 3 Inclusion of density-dependent seedling emergence and flowering within the matrix models alters the relative importance of the elasticity values, emphasizing the role played by the mortality of adults in determining population size and structure, through modulating the flux of individuals from the seedling stage through the intermediate size classes. 4 Estimates of lambda obtained from the generalized density-dependent model run at low density were approximately 22% and 63% higher for U. gallii and U. minor, respectively, than the minimum lambda-values obtained from the site-specific density-independent models. 5 The predicted stable stage distribution differs between the density-independent and equilibrium models (approximately log-linear vs. U-shaped).

The indirect effects of predators on lower trophic levels have been studied without much attention to phenotypically plastic traits of key food web components. Phenotypic plasticity among species creates phenotypic diversity over a changing environmental landscape. 2. We measured the indirect effects of planktivorous larval walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) on phytoplankton biomass through their effects on the dominant herbivore species, Daphnia pulicaria and D. mendotae. 3. Fish had no effect on phytoplankton biomass or overall Daphnia density. We observed a compensatory response to predation by functionally comparable species within a trophic level in the form of shifting dominance and coexistence of Daphnia species. We hypothesized that this phenotypically plastic response to predation decoupled a potential trophic cascade in this freshwater pelagic system. Daphnia pulicaria density decreased over time with fish predation, but D. mendotae density increased over time with fish predation. 4. Phenotypically plastic life history trait shifts and reproductive rates differed between species in fishless and fish enclosures, accounting for population trends. Daphnia pulicaria were also proportionally higher in walleye larvae stomachs than in the enclosures, indicating that walleye preferred to feed on D. pulcaria over D. mendotae. The resultant shift in dominance may partially explain the overall benign effect of fish on grazers and supports the hypothesis that trophic level diversity can decouple a trophic cascade.","Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA","Bernot, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",bernot.1@nd.edu,,"Dodds, Walter/0000-0002-6666-8930",,,,64,6,7,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Identical sampling protocols on 2 shores in each country were used to test 2 specific hypotheses: (1) that molluscan assemblages vary significantly among patches of turf separated by tens of meters, and (2) that these assemblages differ significantly between low- and mid-shore areas. In total, 58, 24 and 27 species of molluscs were found in samples from Australia, Ireland and Chile, respectively. There was a remarkable degree of congruence in the proportion of species that were represented in broad taxonomic groups, with proso-branch gastropods accounting for 52 to 79% of the total diversity at each locality. As predicted, there was significant variation in diversity and abundance of molluscs among patches of turf separated by tens of meters on each of the shores sampled. There was, however, little consistency in the structure of molluscan assemblages at different tidal heights, with significant differences on Australian shores, weak differences on Irish shores and no clear pattern on Chilean shores. Moreover, while the richness of species and abundance of prosobranchs was significantly greater in low-shore areas in Australia and Chile, the opposite trend was found in Ireland. Overall, the results show the potential for generality of factors that have previously been demonstrated to cause patchiness in molluscan assemblages in coralline turf at scales of tens of meters. It is proposed that testing for consistency in ecological patterns can be a useful and cost-effective first step in establishing the general importance of ecological processes.","Univ Sydney, Marine Ecol Labs A11, Ctr Res Ecol Impacts Coastal Cities, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Study Ecol & Biodivers, Santiago, Chile; Univ Wales, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales","Castilla, JC (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, POB 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",jcastill@bio.puc.cl,"Kelaher, Brendan/P-3647-2017","Kelaher, Brendan/0000-0002-7505-4412",,,,67,28,28,0,24,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The growth of both caged and uncaged individuals was monitored at three sites near the mouth of the estuary over 180 days. Growth rates did not differ for caged and uncaged bivalves, or for bivalves subject to different amounts of handling, or between sites. Growth did differ between consecutive time intervals, which was attributable to negligible growth occurring during the colder months of autumn/winter. Comparisons of the condition (as indicated by total mass for length) of S. alba were inconsistent between sites for caged and uncaged bivalves and for those subject to different amounts of handling. Soletellina alba is a rapidly growing bivalve with mean growth rates for the three time intervals being 0.04 +/- 0.002 mm day(-1) in summer, 0.02 +/- 0.001 mm day(-1) in autumn and 0.03 +/- 0.001 mm day(-1) from summer to winter. Using existing literature, it was shown that a significant relationship exists between maximum shell length and onset of sexual maturity in bivalve molluscs. This relationship predicts that S. alba should reach the onset of sexual maturity at 15.8 mm length. Therefore, it appears that it may be possible for juvenile S. alba (<1 mm) to grow, reach sexual maturity and reproduce in between annual mass-mortality events caused by winter flooding.

One explanation for this island rule is that shifts in morphology are an adaptation to facilitate ecological niche expansion. In insular passerines, for instance, increased bill size may facilitate generalist foraging because it allows access to a broader range of feeding niches. Here we use morphologically and ecologically divergent races of white-eyes (Zosteropidae) to test three predictions of this explanation: (1) island populations show a wider feeding niche than mainland populations; (2) island-dwelling populations are made up of individual generalists; and (3) within insular populations there is a positive association between size and degree of foraging generalism. Our results provide only partial support for the traditional explanation. In agreement with the core prediction, island populations of white-eye do consistently display a wider feeding niche than comparative mainland populations. However, observations of individually marked birds reveal that island-dwelling individuals are actually more specialized than expected by chance. Additionally, neither large body size nor large bill size are associated with generalist foraging behavior per se. These latter results remained consistent whether we base our tests on natural foraging behavior or on observations at an experimental tree, and whether we use data from single or multiple cohorts. Taken together, our results suggest that generalist foraging and niche expansion are not the full explanation for morphological shifts in island-dwelling white-eyes. Hence, we review briefly five alternative explanations for morphological divergence in insular populations: environmental determination of morphology, reduced predation pressure, physiological optimization, limited dispersal, and intraspecific dominance.","Univ Queensland, Dept Zool & Entomol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Natl Environm Res Council, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Scott, SN (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Dept Zool & Entomol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",i.owens@imperial.ac.uk,"Blomberg, Simone P/B-7613-2008; Clegg, Sonya/F-5504-2015; Clegg, Sonya M/A-8011-2013; Owens, Ian PF/F-1392-2010","Blomberg, Simone P/0000-0003-1062-0839; Clegg, Sonya/0000-0002-3092-3864; Owens, Ian/0000-0001-6080-3321",,,,70,69,73,0,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,SEP,2003,57,9,,,,,2147,2156,,,,,10,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,727TB,WOS:000185674500016,14575334,,,,2021-09-21,

It has been suggested that this phenomenon is caused by common environmental perturbations, mobile predators or dispersal movements. However, very little focus has been given to how the physical properties of the geographic area over which synchrony occurs, such as landscape composition and climate, affect spatial population dynamics. This study reports on the spatial and temporal properties of vole population fluctuations in two areas of western Finland: one composed of large interconnected areas of agricultural farmland interspersed by forests and the other highly dominated by forest areas, containing more isolated patches of agricultural land. Furthermore, the more agricultural area exhibits somewhat milder winters with less snow than the forested area. We found the amplitude of vole cycles to be essentially the same in the two areas, suggesting that the relative amount of predation on small rodents by generalist versus specialist predators is similar in both areas. No seasonal differences in the timing of synchronization were observable for Microtus voles, whereas bank vole populations in field habitats appeared to become synchronized primarily during winter. Microtus populations in field habitats exhibited smaller spatial variation and a higher degree of synchrony in the more continuous agricultural landscape than in the forest-dominated landscape. We suggest that this inter-areal difference is due to differences in the degree of interpatch connectivity, with predators and dispersal acting as the primary synchronizing agents. Bank vole populations in field habitats were more synchronized within the forest-dominated landscape, most likely reflecting the suitability of the inter-patch matrix and the possibility of dispersal. Our study clearly indicates that landscape composition needs to be taken into account when describing the spatial properties of small rodent population dynamics.","Turku Univ, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, Turku 20014, Finland","Huitu, O (corresponding author), Turku Univ, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, Turku 20014, Finland.",ohuitu@utu.fi,"Norrdahl, Kai/I-7193-2013","Norrdahl, Kai/0000-0002-4202-2043",,,,93,56,59,0,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,APR,2003,135,2,,,,,209,220,,10.1007/s00442-002-1171-6,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,676LQ,WOS:000182753900006,12698342,,,,2021-09-21,

Based on amphibian surveys conducted in ponds and lakes in the northeast quadrant of MORA during the summers of 1993-1995, 20 sites were resampled in 1996 to document and evaluate distributions of the two species relative to site habitat characteristics. Distributions of larvae were assessed either by nearshore snorkel or visual encounter surveys of each study site. Twelve environmental variables representing pond and lake physical characteristics, water quality, and nutrient concentrations were measured. The occurrences at each site of three major habitat components (i.e., pond bottom firmness, coarse woody debris, and emergent/aquatic vegetation) were qualitatively estimated. Allotopic distributions of larval populations of both species were related to site elevation, maximum depth, organic content of bottom substrates, and surface area. Ambystoma gracile sites were larger, deeper, lower in elevation, had flocculent sediment higher in organic content, abundant coarse woody debris, and limited emergent/aquatic vegetation relative to A. macrodactylum sites. Ambystoma macrodactylum sites were smaller, shallower, higher in elevation, had firm sediments low in organic content, and had a greater occurrence of emergent/aquatic vegetation than did A. gracile sites. Two sites supported syntopic populations and exhibited many of the habitat characteristics observed at sites inhabited by each species. The distribution of each species in MORA was related to the interconnection between habitat characteristics of ponds and lakes and species life-history patterns and possibly interspecific interactions.","Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; USGS, Forest & Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, La Conner Dist Off, La Conner, WA 98304 USA","Hoffman, RL (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,,,,,36,10,12,0,8,SOC STUDY AMPHIBIANS REPTILES,ST LOUIS,"C/O ROBERT D ALDRIDGE, ST LOUIS UNIV, DEPT BIOLOGY, 3507 LACLEDE, ST LOUIS, MO 63103 USA",0022-1511,,,J HERPETOL,J.

When considered in the context of pre-existing models of ant-plant interactions, the higher abundance, aggressive nature, and attraction to high-carbohydrate resources typically associated with invasive ants lead to hypotheses about how invasive ants may differ from native ants in protecting plants from herbivores, tending of Homoptera, and interactions affecting plant reproduction. Examples demonstrate that all three of these traits common to invasive ants can influence the outcome of interactions between invasive ants and plants, but ant biology and attributes of other organisms also determine the consequences for the plant. Drawing from these examples and considering traits of the invasive ants, plants, and other organisms that interact with the plant, I offer predictions for the contexts in which plants will be at high and low risk of adverse outcomes or may benefit from interacting with an invasive ant. The potential for effects of invasive ants on plants to counteract, and the complexity and context-dependency that are hallmarks of ant-plant interactions generally, preclude drawing simple conclusions about the net impacts of invasive ants on plants. Further research on interactions between invasive ants and plants will contribute directly to conservation and agriculture, and provide insights to invasion ecology and Our understanding of ant-plant interactions.","Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Lach, L (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Corson Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ljl13@cornell.edu,"Lach, Lori/B-3145-2011","Lach, Lori/0000-0001-5137-5185",,,,153,87,92,0,47,MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN,ST LOUIS,"2345 TOWER GROVE AVENUE, ST LOUIS, MO 63110 USA",0026-6493,2162-4372,,ANN MO BOT GARD,Ann.

The seasonal activity patterns and food habits of these tortoises are studied in the present paper. K. erosa and K. homeana have similar activity patterns, with peaks occurring during the wet season. Kinixys belliana was found only during the wet months. There was no evidence of any specific effect of humidity of the air on their activity intensity, and it seems likely that, more than absolute values of air humidity, the crucial factor to force tortoises into high activity is the sudden change between dry days and very wet days at the onset of the rainy season (end of March - early April). K. homeana was significantly more active in the early phase of the wet season. Common items, which were consumed by all three predator species, were: plant matters, fruits and berries, fungi, Oligochaeta, and Gastropoda Pulmonata, whereas Araneidae were also consumed by all species, but much more rarely. Common prey items, which were consumed by K. homeana and not by K. erosa were: Coleoptera larvae, Dermaptera, and termites. K. homeana appeared more generalist than K. erosa, and the respective diets diverged considerably both in dry and in wet seasons. On the other hand, the diets of K. erosa and K. belliana were more similar (at least in wet season).","FIZV, I-00198 Rome, Italy; Ctr Environm Studies Demetra, I-00198 Rome, Italy","Luiselli, L (corresponding author), FIZV, Via Olona 7, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",lucamlu@tin.it,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020",,,,,58,21,21,0,11,NATURALIS BIODIVERSITY CENTER,LEIDEN,"DARWINWEG 2, LEIDEN, 2333 CR, NETHERLANDS",1383-4517,1875-9866,,CONTRIB ZOOL,Contrib.

Hsp synthesis is activated at the upper temperatures of an organism's thermal range and is therefore thought to be critical for enhancing thermal tolerance limits in ectothermic animals. Here I show, that the two temperate sister species T. brunnea and T montereyi that occupy the subtidal and low-intertidal zone differ from the low - to mid-intertidal T funebralis (and the subtropical mid-intertidal T. rugosa) in (i) heat tolerance, (ii) the onset temperature of their main hsp, hsp70 (70 kDa), (iii) the temperature of maximal hsp70 synthesis, (iv) the upper temperature of hsp synthesis, and (v) the recovery from a thermal stress typical for the mid-intertidal zone. A regulatory model in which hsps themselves regulate their own transcription and synthesis through a negative autoregulatory feedback mechanism can explain acclimation-induced but not interspecific variation in the onset temperature of hsp70 synthesis. Transplanting species across their vertical distribution limits showed that interspecific differences in the stress response are likely to prevent species occurring lower from inhabiting sites higher in the rocky intertidal zone. Endogenous levels of a hsp of a molecular mass of 72 kDa, hsp72, changed little with heat stress in a species' native thermal environment. The results therefore confirm the importance of interspecific differences in the stress response for setting limits to an organism's thermal environment. However, the role of hsps as short-term indicators of sublethal heat stress within a species' native thermal environment may, be limited without a better understanding of their functional and regulatory characteristics.","Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA","Tomanek, L (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA.",tornanekl@leland.stanford.edu,,,,,,36,82,85,1,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1540-7063,1557-7023,,INTEGR COMP BIOL,Integr.

More extensive analysis of the data on the five common species revealed a number of patterns. including: ( 1) a negative association between the two largest lithobiomorphs (2) the importance of many predictor variables, including the soil variables, but with very different patterns for different species.

The fish spatial assemblage was investigated with seven commonly used environmental variables (topographical, biological and substratum variables). Three fish groups colonising three different habitats were identified. The spatial distribution of each fish species was mainly influenced by two environmental factors: distance from the bank (highly correlated with depth) and vegetation cover. i) Young-of-the-year (YOY) cyprinids and northern pike were mainly associated with a small distance from the bank (less than 6 m). ii) Older cyprinids and perch (greater than or equal to1+) were located between 6 and 12 m from the bank. iii) YOY perch and older northern pike (greater than or equal to1+), occurred independently of the distance from the bank, but exhibited different responses to the percentage of vegetation cover: pike preferred areas with dense vegetation cover, while YOY perch abundance decreased rapidly with increasing vegetation cover. Thus, YOY fishes were common and abundant in shallow water, whereas large predators such as northern pike were found in vegetated areas. Therefore, vegetation cover, although generally considered as a crucial 0+ fish habitat, was here a secondary variable after distance from the bank. We hypothesised that the high density of predators (and especially northern pike) inside the vegetation as well as their high predation efficiency in this area could explain such a spatial distribution, shallow littoral areas being, in that case, safer from predation than vegetated ones for YOY fishes.","Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, UMR 5576 CESAC, F-31062 Toulouse 4, France","Brosse, S (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, UMR 5576 CESAC, Bat IVR3,118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 4, France.",,"Brosse, Sebastien/AAC-4689-2019","Brosse, Sebastien/0000-0002-3659-8177",,,,61,13,13,0,5,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGS,STUTTGART,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0003-9136,,,ARCH HYDROBIOL,Arch.

Unfortunately, interaction modifications, which cause pair-wise interaction coefficients to depend on the presence or absence of additional species, can make it difficult to predict the overall dynamics of species within a community from experiments with pairs of species. In a similar fashion, one of the major approaches in evolutionary ecology has been to describe the likely evolutionary dynamics of a single species by focusing on the selection imposed by a limited number of other species within the community. However, recent work on diffuse coevolution indicates that selection pressures due to one species can change in the presence of other species. The magnitude of the difficulty that interaction modifications and diffuse coevolution present for predicting ecological and evolutionary dynamics is an unresolved question. Here we outline the similarities and differences between the two topics, discuss experimental and statistical approaches to studying them, and make predictions about when ecological interaction modifications are likely to cause diffuse coevolution. Since the currencies for interaction modifications are usually fitness components such as growth, fecundity, or survival, is it likely that these will translate into corresponding differences in the relative fitness of individuals or genotypes, and thus in general these two phenomena will occur together. We argue that community ecologists and evolutionary ecologists will both benefit from experiments that test for the effects of interaction modifications, and that studies of the mechanisms driving interaction modifications and diffuse coevolution (e.g., changes in behavior, nonlinear effects on shared resources, genetic covariances) will aid our progress in understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of communities.","Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol Grp, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Inouye, B (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,"Stinchcombe, John/A-2941-2008","Stinchcombe, John/0000-0003-3349-2964",,,,60,59,64,1,37,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,2001,95,2,,,,,353,360,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.950218.x,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,497BX,WOS:000172433800018,,,,,2021-09-21,

We compared the results from a series of six models that incorporated increasing amounts of information about key factors affecting species' ability to adjust to water-level fluctuations. We assessed model accuracy using aerial photographs taken of a 10-yr field experiment. in which 10 wetlands were flooded to 1 in above normal water level for 2 yr, drawn down for or 2 yr, and reflooded for 5 yr to three different water levels (normal, +0.3 in. +0.6 m). We compared each model's ability to predict relative areal cover of five dominant emergent species and to recreate the spatial structure of the landscape as measured by mean area of monospecific stands of vegetation and the degree to which the species were intermixed. The simplest model predicted post-treatment species distributions using logistic regressions based on initial species distributions along the water-depth gradient in the experimental wetlands. Subsequent models were based on germination, rhizomatous dispersal, and mortality functions implemented in each cell of a spatial grid. We tested the effect on model accuracy of incrementally adding data on five factors that can alter the composition and distribution of vegetative zones following a shift in environmental conditions: (1) spatial relationships between areas of suitable habitat (landscape geometry), (2) initial spatial distribution of adults, (3) the presence of ruderal species in the seed bank, (4) the distribution of seed densities in the seed bank, and (5) differential seedling survivorship. Because replicated, long-term data are generally not available, the evaluation of these models represents the first experimental test, of which we are aware, of the ability of a cellular-automaton-type model to predict changes in plant species' distributions. Establishment constraints, such as recruitment from the seed bank, were most important during low-water periods and immediately following a change in water depth. Subsequent to a drop in water level, the most detailed models made the most accurate predictions. The accuracy of all the models converged in 1-2 years after an increase in water level, indicating that current environmental conditions became more important under stable conditions than the effects of historical recruitment events.","Iowa State Univ, Dept Bot, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Seabloom, EW (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, 735 State St,Suite 300, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA.",seabloom@nceas.ucsb.edu,"Moloney, Kirk/H-6483-2011","Moloney, Kirk/0000-0003-1406-9757; Seabloom, Eric/0000-0001-6780-9259",,,,90,49,52,0,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2001,82,8,,,,,2216,2232,,10.2307/2680227,,,17,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,462ZP,WOS:000170452600010,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-21,

Alternative models were evaluated leading to different predictions about the interactive effects of limpets, slope of the substratum and season. These models were distinguished on the basis of spatial and temporal consistency in these interactions. The null hypothesis of consistent effects of limpets was examined at relatively small (0.1 to 5 km) and large (100s of km) spatial scales, between seasons (summer vs winter), between dates within seasons, and in relation to slope of the substratum (horizontal vs vertical substrata). Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated inconsistencies in the effects of limpets at different spatial and temporal scales. Interactions between grazing, slope of the substratum and season changed from shore to shore, and strong effects of limpets were observed only occasionally. This variability is discussed in relation to differences in productivity and intensity of recruitment of algae among shores.","Dipartimento Sci Uomo & Ambiente, I-56126 Pisa, Italy","Benedetti-Cecchi, L (corresponding author), Dipartimento Sci Uomo & Ambiente, Via A Volta 6, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.",bencecc@discat.unipi.it,"Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro/J-8225-2019","Benedetti-Cecchi, Lisandro/0000-0001-5244-5202",,,,64,32,35,0,7,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

We resolve this conflict by attributing negative measured relationships to a statistical artifact that arises because PV tends to be underestimated for populations with short persistence. Such populations do not go extinct quickly as a consequence of low intrinsic variability; instead, the measured variability is low because they go extinct so quickly. Consequently, any underlying positive relationship between PV and ER tends to be obscured. We conducted a series of analyses to evaluate this claim. Simulations showed that negative measured relationships are to be expected, despite an underlying positive relationship. Simulations also identified properties of data, minimizing this bias and thereby permitting meaningful analysis. Experimental data on laboratory populations of a bruchid beetle (Callosobruchus maculatus) supported the simulation results. Likewise, with an appropriate statistical approach (Cox regression on untransformed data), reanalysis of a controversial data set on British island bird populations revealed a significant positive association between PV and ER (p = 0.03). Finally, a similar analysis of time series for naturally regulated animal populations revealed a positive association between PV and quasiextinction risk (p < 0.01). Without exception, our simulation results, experimental findings, reanalysis of published data, and analysis of quasiextinction risk all contradict previous reports of negative or equivocal relationships. Valid analysis of meaningful data provides strong evidence that increased population variability leads to increased extinction risk.","Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forestry, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; Ohio State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Ohio State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Vucetich, JA (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Forestry, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",javuceti@mtu.edu,,,,,,50,58,62,2,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,1523-1739,,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

This benthivore can play an important role in the ecology of both fish and benthic communities in lakes and streams. However, the feeding behaviour and ecology of the white sucker have received limited study beyond a description of gut contents from small samples of fish. In this study, the diet of white suckers was determined in relation to season and depth distribution of the fish, as well as to the abundance and type of zoobenthos sampled at the site of fish capture. Suckers fed predominantly on either zoobenthos or zooplankton, with some seasonal variation. They specialized on particular prey and also on the largest individuals within their speciality, thus exhibiting both resource partitioning and size-selective predation. These findings demonstrate that white suckers can be extremely flexible in their use of resources as opposed to being simple generalist feeders. This attribute, plus their tolerance of a range of environmental conditions, partly explains the abundance of white suckers and their wide distribution in temperate lakes and streams.","Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada","Jackson, DA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada.",jackson@zoo.utoronto.ca,"Jackson, Donald A/J-6441-2013","Jackson, Donald A/0000-0002-6107-0753",,,,67,23,23,1,17,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

We studied the influence of the shrubs Buxus sempervirens and Juniperus communis on Q. humilis establishment, and of Buxus on the growth of established Q. humilis individuals. 2 Percentage germination of experimentally planted Q. humilis was higher under shrubs than in nearby open areas and higher on the north than the south side of the canopy. Germination where part of the canopy has been removed was similar to that away from the shrubs, suggesting that the facilitation mechanism is related to changes in microclimate rather than to a soil effect. 3 When exposed to sheep for 1 month, 100% of 326 unprotected oak seedlings were grazed, causing 44% mortality. The presence of Buxus and Juniperus improved seedling survival by protecting them against sheep grazing and summer drought. Predation by rodents was however greater under shrub cover. 4 The highest leaf dry mass of oak seedlings was recorded under Juniperus where light conditions seem more favourable for growth than under Buxus (direct effect) or in grassland (indirect effect). The growth of naturally established individuals of Q. humilis (in terms of total leaf mass per annual branch and width of rings) was lower under Buxus than in grassland but the values became similar once the canopy was overtopped. 5 The balance between positive and negative interactions varied in relation to the life stage of Q. humilis and the two shrub species. Regeneration of Q. humilis in open grassland was prevented by grazing. The protection offered by shrubs continues to offset the negative interference on growth, particularly under Buxus, so that plants could survive to overtop the shrub canopy and reach maturity. The succession pathway therefore depends closely on the distribution of shrubs in the grassland.","Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, CNRS, UPR 9056, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Lepart, J (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, CNRS, UPR 9056, 1919 Route de Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",,,,,,,50,165,182,3,54,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0477,,,J ECOL,J.

We argue that two mutually exclusive sets of such assumptions are available and that they have given rise to alternative approaches to studying ecology. The fundamentally different premises of these approaches render them irreconcilable with one another. In this paper, we present the first logical formalisation of these two paradigms. The more widely-accepted approach - which we label the demographic paradigm - includes both population ecology and community ecology (synecology). Demographic ecology assumes that the environment is relatively stable and that biotic processes, governed predominantly by resource availability, are the most important of ecological and evolutionary influences. Moreover, ecological processes are assumed to translate into directional selection pressures that drive significant evolutionary change on a local scale through the process of optimisation. Serious deficiencies in aspects of the demographic approach have been identified over the past few decades by various ecologists, including Gleason, Andrewartha and Birch, White, Den Beer, Strong, Simberloff, and others. Short-term evolutionary optimisation has also been seriously questioned. The development of the alternative approach (autecology) has been subverted by the prominence of demographic ecology. Moreover, it has not been recognised that autecology is underpinned by robust principles and that they are independent of the underlying demographic principles. Components of the autecological approach have been developed to some extent, but they have not been integrated with ancillary fields of study. We therefore articulate the assumptions from which autecology is derived, and use this as a basis for integrating the various spheres of autecological research. We add to the ongoing development of autecology by linking autecological understanding, in so far as it is developed, with the evolutionary justification for species' characteristics being stable in an environment that is continuously dynamic in space and time. The ecology of organisms is essentially an ongoing matching of their species-specific characteristics to the prevailing environmental factors and dynamics. We thus provide a consistent logic through the following subject areas; climate and climate change, spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity and dynamic theory, physiology, behaviour, migration, and evolution. We demonstrate why adaptation cannot be an ongoing process, but takes place only when organisms are prevented, by incidental influences, from matching the overall dynamics of the environment.","Univ Queensland, Dept Zool & Entomol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; Natl Museum Nat Hist, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; Inst Forestry & Nat Res, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Hengeveld, R (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Dept Zool & Entomol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",,"Walter, Gimme/AAC-3635-2019","Walter, Gimme/0000-0003-1025-7101",,,,100,20,20,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0001-5342,1572-8358,,ACTA BIOTHEOR,Acta Biotheor.,MAR,2000,48,1,,,,,15,46,,10.1023/A:1002670731066,,,32,Mathematical & Computational Biology,Mathematical & Computational Biology,319XX,WOS:000087371900002,,,,,2021-09-21,

Studies of oceanic islands and of natural habitat islands share some similarities to continental studies, particularly in developed regions where habitat fragmentation results from many land uses. Increasingly, remnant habitat is in the form of isolates created by the clearing and destruction of natural areas. Future evolution of a theory to predict patterns of species abundance may well come from the application of island biogeography to habitat fragments or isolates. 2 In this paper we consider four factors other than area and isolation that influence the number and type of mammal species coexisting in one place: habitat diversity, habitat disturbance, species interactions and guild assembly rules. In all examples our data derive from mainland habitat, fragmented to differing degrees, with different levels of isolation. 3 Habitat diversity is seen to be a good predictor of species richness. Increased levels of disturbance produce a relatively greater decrease in species richness on smaller than on larger isolates. Species interactions in the recolonization of highly disturbed sites, such as regenerating mined sites, is analogous to island colonization. Species replacement sequences in secondary successions indicate not just how many, but which species are included. Lastly, the complement of species established on islands, or in insular habitats, may be governed by guild assembly rules. These contributions may assist in taking a renewed theory into the new millennium.","Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; Univ New S Wales, Sch Geog, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","Fox, BJ (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",b.fox@unsw.edu.au; m.fox@unsw.edu.au,"Fox, Barry J/C-4491-2008",,,,,70,68,83,4,76,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,1466-8238,,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Where some other conservation activities, such as protection of existing wilderness, continue to require making the best of increasingly bad situations, the goal of restoration raises the pleasing prospect of measurable improvement in landscapes. Restoration simultaneously provides the ultimate test for the discipline of community ecology: ecologists should be able to build an ecosystem in the same way an engineer builds a bridge, with a list of parts connected in specified ways leading to certain reliable outcomes. Failures would reveal that scientists do not adequately understand the system. Practical considerations suggest the application of tools that already exist rather than the invention of new ones. The objective of this paper is to suggest that two valuable tools may already exist, tools that provide an intellectual foundation for restoration ecology. Such a foundation is necessary because there has been a tendency for restoration ecology to represent a haphazard collection of individual cases rather than a well-defined discipline with repeatable methods. One possible scheme for unifying studies of restoration is that provided by assembly rules, where predictions are based upon key environmental factors and the responses of species to those factors. The potential of such assembly rules is introduced using three examples: fish in wetlands, plants in salt marshes, and plants in prairie potholes. I then describe an experiment where a standard species pool of wetland plants was sown into twenty-four different sets of environmental conditions, illustrating how landscapes can select communities out of larger pools. A second possible tool is indicators of ecosystem integrity. These can measure whether a project actually works. Clear discrimination between success and failure can improve restoration procedures by accelerating the evolution of management principles and techniques; Holling has called this process 'adaptive environmental assessment.' I conclude with the optimistic view that restoration already has the tools for continued progress; what is needed is primarily their intelligent application. That is, rather than ending with a typically academic plea for more research, I suggest (for a change) char what is needed is only the discriminating application of procedures and principles that already exist.","Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Keddy, P (corresponding author), SE Louisiana Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Edward G Schlieder Endowed chair Environm Studies, Hammond, LA 70402 USA.",pkeddy@selu.edu,,,,,,130,51,54,2,106,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0277-5212,1943-6246,,WETLANDS,Wetlands,DEC,1999,19,4,,,,,716,732,,10.1007/BF03161780,,,17,Ecology; Environmental Sciences,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,270GC,WOS:000084526200002,,,,,2021-09-21,

Natural selection is endogenous if hybrid genotypes are at a disadvantage relative to parental species independent of environment. Alternatively, relative fitness can vary in response to environmental variation (exogenous selection), and hybrid genotypes can possess fitness values equal to or greater than that of parental species. I investigated the nature of natural selection in a leopard frog hybrid system by rearing larvae of hybrid and parental genotypes between Rana blairi and R. sphenocephala in 1000-L outdoor experimental ponds. Three hybrid (F-1, backcross(1) [B-1], backcross(2) [B-2]) and two parental (R. blairi [BB] and R. sphenocephala [SS]) larval genotypes were produced by artificial fertilzations using adult frogs from a natural population in central Missouri. Resultant larvae were reared in single-genotype populations and two-way mixtures at equal total numbers from hatching to metamorphosis. In single-genotype ponds, F-1 hybrid larvae had highest survival and BE were largest at metamorphosis. When F-1 and SS larvae were mixed together, F-1 hybrids had reduced survival and both F-1 and SS larvae metamorphosed at larger body masses than when reared separately. When mixed, both B-1 and SS larvae had shorter larval period lengths than when reared alone. Higher proportion of B-1 metamorphs were produced when larvae were mixed with either parental species than when reared alone. Larval fitness components as measured by survival, body mass at metamorphosis, proportion of survivors metamorphosing, and larval period length for B-1 hybrid and BB larvae were similar in single-genotype populations and mixtures. Comparison of composite fitness component estimates indicated hybrid genotypes possess equivalent or higher larval fitness relative to both parental species for the life-history fitness components measured. Despite reduced survival of F-1 hybrids in mixtures, backcross-generation hybrid genotypes demonstrated high levels of larval growth, survival, and metamorphosis in mixtures with parental species. Consequently, this study suggests natural hybridization and subsequent backcrossing between R. blairi and R. sphenocephala can produce novel and relatively fit hybrid genotypes capable of successful existence with parental species larvae. Thus, the evolutionary fate of hybrid and parental genotypes in this system may be influenced by exogenous selection mediated by genotypic composition of larval assemblages.","Univ Missouri, Div Biol Sci, Columbia, MO 65211 USA","Parris, MJ (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Dept Biol, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",mparris@asu.edu,,,,,,84,24,24,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,DEC,1999,53,6,,,,,1872,1883,,10.2307/2640447,,,12,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,273JA,WOS:000084703100020,28565457,,,,2021-09-21,

I surveyed natural and experimentally planted populations of common ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) for a variety of herbivorous insects. Early and late instar cinnabar moth (Tyria jacobaeae) larvae differed significantly in their incidence patterns on the experimental arrays, with young caterpillars most prevalent on closely spaced hosts, and older caterpillars on more widely spaced plants. The difference suggests opposite density biases may apply to maternal oviposition and larval dispersal behaviours. Two other herbivores (the leaf miner Chromatomyia syngenesiae and the flowerhead boring Botanophila spp.) showed significant biases towards low density hosts in the experimental plantings. In natural populations. another leaf miner, Liriomyza strigata, preferentially attacked low-density plants, whilst C. syngenesiae incidence was highest at intermediate host densities. The difference between natural and experimental populations suggests a difference between colonisation dynamics and longer-term population effects. I review and contrast six possible explanations for the diversity of density responses found amongst herbivores in this and other comparable studies.

Visitor profiles of plants were influenced by flowering phenology, the vegetation type in which they occurred, blossom shape and colour, and botanical family. Most Colletidae, especially in the subfamilies Euryglossinae and Hylaeinae, predominantly visited brush-like inflorescences and/or members of Myrtaceae. However, some Colletidae, particularly in the subfamily Colletinae, were oligolectic on non-myrtaceous petaloid flowers. Many Halictidae were polylectic, others foraged predominantly on the yellow zygomorphic flowers of Fabaceae, while others were largely restricted to non-yellow actinomorphic flowers. Both species of Anthophoridae were polylectic, whereas both species of Megachilidae were narrowly polylectic on non-white flowers. It is argued that pollination of nectarless flowers is likely to be enhanced by the presence of petaloid nectariferous flowers, particularly Fabaceae and Leucopogon spp., which provide carbohydrates for their bee pollinators. Mutualism between sequentially, and also possibly concomitantly, flowering nectariferous flowers is also likely via support of shared bee pollinators.","Univ Tasmania, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Hingston, AB (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, GPO box 252-78, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",,,,,,,41,12,13,0,4,C S I R O PUBLISHING,COLLINGWOOD,"150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA",0004-959X,,,AUST J ZOOL,Aust.

The three owls preyed chiefly upon small mammals, while birds were occasionally eaten. The trophic niches of A. otus in the three study areas were significantly narrower than that of T. alba and S. aluco. These latter species varied the size of their prey between the three localities, while A. otus preyed upon similarly sized prey in the three study areas. By using data on small mammal occurrence we tried to estimate the environmental type where the owls conducted their predatory activity: principal component analysis revealed that A. otus was linked to the cultivated fields as foraging habitat, while S. aluco and ir: alba were less selective in the choice of hunting habitat. Furthermore, discriminant analysis indicated that species dietary habits maintained their distinguishing features also in distant localities. However, it appeared that owls did not use foraging resource with an exclusive strategy: evidences from this study are consistent with the hypothesis of a selective use of the trophic resource by A. otus, while diets of T. alba and S. aluco showed differences between the three localitites.","Ist Nazl Fauna Selvat, I-40064 Ozzano Emilia, Italy; Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sci Biol, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria; Inst Ecol, CNF, Calabar, Cross River Sta, Nigeria","Capizzi, D (corresponding author), Ist Nazl Fauna Selvat, Via Ca Fornacetta 9, I-40064 Ozzano Emilia, Italy.",me3176@mclink.it,"Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020; CAPIZZI, DARIO/O-6431-2019","Capizzi, Dario/0000-0003-0871-9602",,,,67,9,10,1,15,SOC NATL PROTECTION NATURE ACCLIMATATION FRANCE,PARIS 5,"57 RUE CUVIER, 75005 PARIS 5, FRANCE",0249-7395,,,REV ECOL-TERRE VIE,Rev.

Density dependence of avian reproduction has often been analysed using correlations between annual mean reproductive output and population density. Experiments are necessary to prove that density is the cause of the observed patterns, but so far, three out of four experimental studies do not support a direct causal effect of density on reproduction. 2. This paper presents experimental evidence that reproductive decisions in great tits, Parus major L., are causally affected by breeding density. The breeding density of great tits was manipulated by providing nest-boxes at different densities in an ecologically homogeneous area. 3. Within years the densities in the high and low density plots differed approximately 8-fold.

Such interactions cause population dynamics on large spatial scales to differ in important ways from predictions based on measurements of population dynamics at smaller scales, a phenomenon called the scale transition. These differences can account for large-scale population stability and species coexistence. The interactions between density dependence and spatial variation that lead to the scale transition can be understood by the process of non-linear averaging, which shows how variance originating on various spatial scales contributes to large-scale population dynamics. Variance originating below the scale of density dependence contributes less to the scale transition as the spatial scale of the variation declines, while variation originating on or above the scale of density dependence contributes independently of the spatial scale of the variation.","Australian Natl Univ, Inst Adv Studies, Res Sch Biol Sci, Ecosyst Dynam Grp, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Chesson, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Div Biol Sci, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Storer Hall, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,,,,36,47,50,0,13,BLACKWELL SCIENCE,CARLTON,"54 UNIVERSITY ST, P O BOX 378, CARLTON, VICTORIA 3053, AUSTRALIA",0307-692X,,,AUST J ECOL,Aust.

A field investigation of small-scale (cm to m) mobility was carried out on the Ythan estuary, Aberdeenshire, during immersion and after the ebb of the tide. Observations on immigration to, emigration from and activity within small areas of sediment indicated that mobility is low, but animals that do move are adult males which crawl over the sediment rather than swim. These individuals moved only short distances and they frequently re-used existing burrows. This movement is probably related to reproductive behaviour. The low mobility and the short distances moved indicated that mobility has little impact on at least large and intermediate scale heterogeneity, but shows that small-scale patterns are constantly dynamic in time and space.","Univ Aberdeen, Dept Zool, Culterty Field Stn, Ellon AB41 6AA, Aberdeen, Scotland","Lawrie, SM (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Dept Zool, Culterty Field Stn, Ellon AB41 6AA, Aberdeen, Scotland.",,,,,,,21,15,15,0,3,GORDON BREACH SCI PUBL LTD,READING,"C/O STBS LTD, PO BOX 90, READING RG1 8JL, BERKS, ENGLAND",0091-181X,,,MAR FRESHW BEHAV PHY,Mar.

The trophic-dynamic model is built on the mass balance of each trophic level in terms of growth, respiration, and predation. The results of simulation show that algae are limited by nutrients in one-link and three-link systems and by predators in a two-link food chain. These conclusion is in good agreement with other theoretical predictions. As a result, bio-management of predators to regulate excessive algae only works in two-link and four-link food chains.

Rapidly advancing geographical information systems (GIS) technologies are forcing a careful evaluation of the roles and biases of landscape and traditional site-based perspectives on assessments of aquatic communities. Viewing the world at very different scales can lead to seeming contradictions about the nature of specific ecological systems. In the case of Michigan trout streams, landscape analyses suggest a predictable community shaped by large-scale patterns in hydrology and geology. Most site-based studies, however, suggest these communities are highly variable in structure over time, and are strongly shaped by site-specific physical and biological dynamics. As the real world is comprised of processes operating both at local and landscape scales, an analytical framework for integrating these paradigms is desirable. 2. Decomposition of variances by factorial ANOVA into time, space and time-space interaction terms can provide a conceptual and analytical model for integrating processes operating at landscape and local scales. Using this approach, long-term data sets were examined for three insects and two fishes common in Michigan trout streams. Each taxon had a unique variance structure, and the observed variance structure was highly dependent upon sample size. 3. Both spatially extensive designs with little sampling over time (typical of many GIS studies) and temporally extensive designs with little or no spatial sampling (typical of population and community studies), are biased in terms of their view of the relative importance of local and landscape factors. The necessary, but in many cases costly, solution is to develop and analyse data sets that are both spatially and temporally extensive.","ILLINOIS NAT HIST SURVEY, CTR AQUAT ECOL, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820 USA; MICHIGAN DEPT NAT RESOURCES, FISHERIES RES INST, ANN ARBOR, MI USA","Wiley, MJ (corresponding author), UNIV MICHIGAN, SCH NAT RESOURCES & ENVIRONM, ANN ARBOR, MI 48109 USA.",,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009; Wiley, Michael/A-6853-2012",,,,,69,172,178,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

The ability of larvae to choose favourable places to settle in terms of persistence may make the dynamics of certain populations predictable at the reef scale, and cause patterns of recruitment to differ from those of larval supply. I collected data on settlement, recruitment and persistence of the ocean surgeonfish Acanthurus bahianus in different physiographic zones of the Tague Bay reef, on the island of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. There was significantly higher settlement and recruitment to the back-reef zone than to the fore-reef zone or seagrass zones at the bases of the back-reef and fore-reef, suggesting that larvae select settlement sites and do not necessarily settle to the first reef zone encountered. On the back-reef, settlers used pavement more than any other type of substratum, and the post-settlement persistence of settlers and recruits was highest on pavement when compared to these other substrata. These results suggest that patterns of ocean surgeonfish settlement are affected by reef-based processes, and that selection for certain zones and substrata occurs. Subsequent modification of these initial settlement patterns by increased persistence in preferred habitats adds predictability to patterns of recruitment, resulting in larval supply alone being an insufficient explanation of the distribution and abundance of ocean surgeonfish populations at this scale.","Univ Windsor, Dept Biol Sci, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada","Risk, A (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Dept Biol Sci, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",sale@server.uwindsor.ca,,,,,,78,20,22,1,8,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

In the case of benthic organisms, their complex life cycle often involves a planktonic phase affected by dispersal processes, which are responsible for high variability in recruitment. Exposed, high energy sandy beaches, constitute a distinct and well-defined ecosystem which fall into the category of physically stressed environments. In this sense, it has been largely considered that spatial and temporal recruitment patterns in exposed sandy beach populations should be fully explained by their adaptation to such a dynamic environment, being biotic interdependences mainly limited to low energy beaches. However, little is known about long-term recruitment variability in these populations and, with the exception of two recent examples given in this review, reliable predictions of recruitment from a given level of stock have not been demonstrated. Potential causes are: (I) the inherent difficulties in sampling and experimentally manipulating the generally small or mobile infauna; (2) the horizontal and vertical space partitioning of the habitat, which makes the recognition of biological interdependences very complex; (3) the general lack of lone-term data sets directed to estimate such type of relationship; and (4) the absence of information about the scale-dependence of processes and patterns structuring sandy beach populations. In this paper I review existing information about recruitment variability in sandy beach populations. Regulatory mechanisms causing population fluctuations in the long-term and at different spatial scales, and the biotic and abiotic processes responsible for it, are analyzed in comparison with invertebrates of rocky and soft, sheltered shores. It is unclear how the conclusions emanated from intertidal rocky and soft-bottom sheltered habitats apply to exposed beaches. The lack of scientific knowledge emphasizes the need for additional observations on the natural history and long-term dynamics of exposed sandy beach populations. Recent results obtained from long-term studies suggest that the traditional designation of exposed sandy beach populations as physically structured seems incomplete. The definition of the relevant scales of analysis, which will vary according to the research question, and the recognition of a physical-biological coupling in different scales, shows an alternative approach concerning the study of population regulation and dynamics in exposed sandy beaches.",,"Defeo, O (corresponding author), INST NACL PESCA, CONSTITUYENTE 1497, MONTEVIDEO 11200, URUGUAY.",,,,,,,156,49,51,1,11,SOC BIOLGIA CHILE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 16164, SANTIAGO 9, CHILE",0716-078X,0717-6317,,REV CHIL HIST NAT,Rev.

Habitat use, time-activity budgets, and foraging behavior data were collected for six co-occurring species: great blue heron (Ardea herodias), great egret (Casmerodius albus), little blue heron (Egretta caerulea), snowy egret (E. thula), tricolored heron (E. tricolor), and green-backed heron (Butorides striatus). Additionally, energetics models were developed for the six species to understand endogenous reserve loss during adverse weather conditions and risk of mortality. I found no habitat segregation in this species assemblage, although there was evidence of microhabitat selection based on water depth. There was an inverse relationship between numbers of herons and egrets in freshwater marshes versus intermediate and brackish marshes. This reflected high water levels in the latter marshes that forced the birds to seek suitable foraging habitat (water depth) in more northern marshes. Larger (longer-legged) species tended to be found in deeper water, although species frequently were found together in shallow water. Time-activity budgets showed that these species spent the majority of time standing (leafing), and there tended to be an inverse relationship between body size and percent time spent foraging. Severe weather caused the birds to suspend foraging and remain sheltered from the wind. During one three-day period I observed no foraging in the five species I observed on those dates. After the storm passed I observed fewer birds, which suggests that substantial mortality had occurred. Simulation modeling predicted a 6-12% decline in body mass over a three-day fasting interval inversely correlated with body size (smaller species lost proportionately more mass), and the four smaller species each lost > 10% in mass. Consequently, winter weather conditions, particularly severe storms, may be more critical for smaller heron and egret species.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT ZOOL,DAVIS,CA 95616",,,,,,,,45,12,15,0,20,SOUTHWESTERN ASSN NATURALISTS,SAN MARCOS,"SOUTHWEST TEXAS STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOLOGY, 601 UNIVERSITY DR, SAN MARCOS, TX 78666",0038-4909,,,SOUTHWEST NAT,Southw.

Our ability to quantitatively predict these impacts is, in part, limited by the absence of suitable plant-spread models and by inadequate parameter estimates for such models. This paper explores the effects of model, plant, and environmental attributes on predicted rates and patterns of spread of alien pine trees (Pinus spp.) in South African fynbos (a mediterranean-type shrubland). A factorial experimental design was used to: (1) compare the predictions of a simple reaction-diffusion model and a spatially explicit, individual-based simulation model; (2) investigate the sensitivity of predicted rates and patterns of spread to parameter values; and (3) quantify the effects of the simulation model's spatial grain on its predictions. The results show that the spatial simulation model places greater emphasis on interactions among ecological processes than does the reaction-diffusion model. This ensures that the predictions of the two models differ substantially for some factor combinations. The most important factor in the model is dispersal ability. Fire frequency, fecundity, and age of reproductive maturity are less important, while adult mortality has little effect on the model's predictions. The simulation model's predictions are sensitive to the model's spatial grain. This suggests that simulation models that use matrices as a spatial framework should ensure that the spatial grain of the model is compatible with the spatial processes being modeled. We conclude that parameter estimation and model development must be integrated procedures. This will ensure that the model's structure is compatible with the biological processes being modeled.

The prevalence of models lacking any trait dynamics has led to methods of identifying and measuring indirect effects that are not valid when phenotypically or evolutionarily plastic traits affect interspecific interactions. When traits are dynamic, the number of links in a dynamic model can no longer be used to distinguish direct and indirect effects, and classifying interactions by a single sign denoting effect on equilibrium density becomes problematic. The presence of trait dynamics also changes the interpretation of manipulative experiments that have been used to measure indirect effects. Because both traits and population densities can transmit indirect effects, a given ordered series of species will often transmit several indirect effects, which may have opposite signs. Because some traits can change very rapidly, dynamic equations describing population growth rates may often include the densities of species that interact indirectly with the given species. Some of the conceptual problems in comparing magnitudes of direct and indirect effects are illustrated by simple models of a three-species food chain. Different methods of measuring effect magnitudes can give different conditions for when direct effects are larger than indirect effects. Other terminology related to indirect effects, including interaction modification and higher-order interaction, is critically discussed. Given the present paucity of information about trait dynamics, it may be premature to attempt to compare magnitudes of direct and indirect effects.",,"ABRAMS, PA (corresponding author), UNIV MINNESOTA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & BEHAV, 1987 UPPER BUFORD CIRCLE, ST PAUL, MN 55108 USA.",,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008; Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X; ",,,,64,349,361,4,117,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,1537-5323,,AM NAT,Am.

The philosophical and statistical aspects of this criticism of LP are reviewed in light of the ability to test any nontrivial ecological theory. It is argued that measures of error in field data may not meet simple statistical definitions, and thereby, may make sensitivity analyses that use the error measures overly conservative.

A significant spatial trend in diet composition existed even after accounting for the main effects measured by the environmental variables. The two sets of spatial variables, when combined with the environmental descriptors, extracted different components of the dietary variation. The study allowed us to (1) highlight the role of spatial structure in diet variation of brook trout, (2) determine the relative contribution of both environmental and spatial components, and (3) generate testable hypotheses concerning mechanisms underlying the observed structure. Dependent variables other than diet composition, such as the density of different species at different sampling sites, can be used within the same statistical framework in studies of community ecology.","UNIV MONTREAL, DEPT SCI BIOL, MONTREAL, PQ H3C 3J7, CANADA","MAGNAN, P (corresponding author), UNIV QUEBEC, DEPT CHIM BIOL, CP 500, TROIS RIVIERES, PQ G9A 5H7, CANADA.",,"Magnan, Pierre/U-9342-2019; Legendre, Pierre/C-8279-2013; Legendre, Pierre/U-9266-2019; Rodriguez, Marco A./J-6492-2012","Magnan, Pierre/0000-0003-3122-7163; Legendre, Pierre/0000-0002-3838-3305; Legendre, Pierre/0000-0002-3838-3305; Rodriguez, Marco A./0000-0003-0391-9170",,,,55,69,72,0,27,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Despite their general similarities in behaviour, they differ in morphology, and these differences are often interpreted as adaptations for use of different resources. Here we report on the relation between morphology, habitat selection and feeding ecology in seven tit species (Parus spp.) in Fennoscandia. A problem previously disregarded in most ecomorphological studies is that members of a guild with closely related species share their common ancestry. This historical legacy causes similarity in ecology and morphology. We have used phylogenetic information with proper comparative methods to reveal the evolutionary associations. Our field data represented the winter, when tits commonly form mixed-species flocks and exploit nonrenewable and limited food resources. Our rigorous analysis confirmed the previous suggestions that the smallest tit species tend to forage in the exterior tree parts whereas the heavier species use the inner parts. Another ecomorphological pattern is that tits inhabiting coniferous habitats have more slender bills than those inhabiting deciduous habitats. After removing the effects of historical legacy, we found strong support for adaptive interpretations of among-species variation in habitat selection and foraging site selection. Ecological variation along either of these two niche axes is associated with predictable morphological variation.","UPPSALA UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, S-75236 UPPSALA, SWEDEN","SUHONEN, J (corresponding author), UNIV JYVASKYLA, DEPT BIOL & ENVIRONM SCI, POB 35, SF-40351 JYVASKYLA, FINLAND.",,"Gustafsson, Lars/A-7634-2012; Gustafsson, Lars/O-8056-2019","Gustafsson, Lars/0000-0001-6566-2863; Gustafsson, Lars/0000-0001-6566-2863",,,,35,40,40,1,16,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Sexual reproduction can create rare genotypes that may escape predation by virtue of rarity and can create variable progeny that may escape predation if enemies are specialized to only one genotype of host. Populations of the herbivorous thrips, Apterothrips apteris, have been shown to be adapted to individual Erigeron glaucus clones. Here, we show that thrips adapted to the parental clone could better use plant progeny of the ''home'' clone produced through selfing than progeny derived from selfing of other clones. Thus, despite recombination, progeny produced by selfing presented a resource that was similar to the parental phenotype with respect to use by adapted thrips. We also show that E. glaucus susceptibility to thrips has a genetic basis and then ask whether outcrossing provides a means for E. glaucus clones to escape attack by adapted thrips. When we compared the success of thrips on progeny produced by selfing or outcrossing of the home clone, we found that the merits or disadvantages associated with outcrossing were dependent on the susceptibility to infestation of the parental clones. Selfing by clones characterized by low infestations of thrips appeared to preserve resistant genotypes; all outcrossed progeny had, on average, higher infestation levels than selfed progeny. In contrast, outcrossed progeny of clones characterized by high infestations of thrips had either the same thrips density as progeny from selfing, when the pollen donor was a highly infested clone, or lower density, when the pollen donor was a low infestation clone. The advantages of outcrossing were caused by the alleles contributed to progeny rather than to progeny variability or rarity.",,"STRAUSS, SY (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS, DEPT ENTOMOL, EVOLUT & ECOL SECT, STORER HALL, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA.",,"Strauss, Sharon/J-1827-2012","Strauss, Sharon/0000-0002-6117-4085",,,,36,43,43,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,APR,1994,48,2,,,,,454,464,,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1994.tb01323.x,,,11,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,PQ539,WOS:A1994PQ53900016,28568295,,,,2021-09-21,

We ask whether we can disrupt the ability of thrips to use progeny of their ''home''-plant clone by outcrossing females with males from other plant clones. We compare the performance of sexually produced thrips to that of parthenogenetically produced thrips on plant progeny of the home clone. Because we use thrips from plant clones experiencing both high and low infestations by thrips, we also ask whether the relative performance of ''sexuals'' versus ''parthenogens'' differs with the infestation level of the home clone. Plant progeny of 10 E. glaucus clones were either the product of selfing or of outcrossing with the other 9 clones. We have shown in previous work that selfing preserved the parental phenotype with respect to attack by thrips. Because of this result, we predicted that parthenogens should fare better than sexuals on the selfed progeny of the home-plant clone. Our results, however, showed the contrary: sexuals outperformed parthenogens on these selfed plants.

I used a half-sib design to partition phenotypic and quantitative genetic variation in tadpole responses at two food levels into causal variance components. Rana lessonae displays strong phenotypic variation across food levels. Growth rate is strictly determined by environmental factors and includes weak maternal effects. Larval period and body size at metamorphosis both contain moderate levels of additive genetic variance. The sire x food interactions and the lack of environmental correlations indicate that adaptive phenotypic plasticity is present in both of these traits. In contrast, R. esculenta displays less phenotypic variation across food levels, especially for larval period. Variation in body size at metamorphosis is underlain by genetic variation as shown by high levels of additive genetic variance, yet growth rate and larval period are not. Significant environmental correlations between larval period at high food level and growth, larval period, and body size at low food, indicate phenotypic plasticity is absent. A positive phenotypic correlation between body size at metamorphosis and larva]. period for R. lessonae at both food levels suggests a trade-off between growing large and metamorphosing quickly to escape predation or pond drying. The lack of a similar correlation for R. esculenta at the high food level suggests it may be less constrained. Different level of adaptive genetic variation among larval traits suggest that the sexual. species and the hybridogenetic hemiclone differ in their abilities to cope with temporally and spatially heterogeneous environments.","UNIV ZURICH, INST ZOOL, CH-8057 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND",,,,"Semlitsch, Raymond/0000-0002-7999-5762",,,,60,45,47,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,DEC,1993,47,6,,,,,1805,1818,,10.2307/2410223,,,14,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,NT236,WOS:A1993NT23600015,28568004,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

We found no effect of lake size or prey size diversity on species richness. Pair density was correlated with the percentage of shoreline with horsetails (Equisetum), by habitat structural diversity and by the abundance of emergent invertebrate prey.

In the first experiment, the zooplanktivorous fish species, roach (Rutilus rutilus) (primary carnivore), was reduced to 27% of its previous population size (53%) of biomass) by a selective rotenone treatment. In the second experiment, zander (Stizostedion lucioperca) (secondary carnivore), were stocked in the lake resulting in a reduction in the population size of roach to 51% of its previous population size (31% of biomass). In both experiments, seasonal average biomass of Daphnia cucullata) increased in the two years with the lowest roach biomasses. but no shift to larger zooplankton forms took place. In the years with increased Daphnia biomass, phytoplankton biomass and transparency showed an increased seasonal variation (measured as coefficient of variation). In contrast to manipulations in which planktivorous fish were totally removed, no effect on seasonal average phytoplankton biomass was observed. Due to the high reproductive capacity of roach, the system returned to previous conditions within a year or two after the perturbations. Under unperturbed conditions, the lake showed few indications of instability as suggested by the paradox of enrichment hypothesis. This lack of instability can. among other things, be related to high zooplanktivore predation pressure present in highly productive lakes preventing overexploitation of primary producers by grazers. In addition, the omnivorous feeding characteristics of roach (feeding on both zooplankton and algae/detritus) and interactions between the open water and the detritus nutrient pool are likely to increase the stability of the system. The two perturbation experiments plus a previous natural experiment (winter fish kill), which all were pulsed perturbations, provide no evidence for the presence of alternative stable states in highly productive lakes. Possibly, a sustained perturbation over several years may shift highly productive lakes from a dominance of phytoplankton production to a dominance of macrophyte production leading to an alternative state.","UNIV LUND,DEPT ECOL LIMNOL,S-22100 LUND,SWEDEN","PERSSON, L (corresponding author), UMEA UNIV,DEPT ANIM ECOL,S-90187 UMEA,SWEDEN.",,"Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013; Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; ",,,,90,62,63,0,36,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,1993,66,2,,,,,193,208,,10.2307/3544805,,,16,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KJ535,WOS:A1993KJ53500003,,,,,2021-09-21,

In 1988 we used two experiments to examine the interaction between ant tending and aphid density on the per capita growth of aphid populations at naturally occurring low aphid densities, and naturally occurring high aphid densities. In 1989, we conducted a similar experiment, but we manipulated aphid densities to include the full range from low to high. The results of these experiments were consistent: ant tending significantly improved the growth of small aphid populations, but the benefit from ant tending decreased or disappeared at higher aphid densities. We considered possible mechanisms for the density-dependent mutualistic effect by examining the relationships among aphid density, the number of ants tending, and predator abundance. We show that the relative number of ants tending declined as aphid density increased, and ant tending did not reduce predator abundance at any aphid densities. Therefore, the cause of the density-dependent mutualism is probably a decline in the direct effect of ants on aphids resulting from a decline in the relative number of ants tending aphids at higher aphid densities.

A previously untested assumption that underlies most studies of the evolution of plant resistance is that insect distribution patterns are controlled directly by the effects of plant genotype on insect preference and performance. The experiments described here explicitly tested this assumption using the specialist herbivore Uroleucon tissoti (Homoptera: Aphididae) and its host plant Solidago altissima (Asteraceae). Measures of aphid preference and performance were used to predict aphid distribution patterns, and then the predicted distribution patterns were compared with the natural distribution pattern. Although goldenrod genotype had a strong effect on aphid distribution, aphid distribution was not controlled directly by the effect of goldenrod genotype on aphid preference and performance. Instead, a second experiment demonstrated that aphid and spittlebug (Philaenus spumarius and Lepyronia quadrangularis Homoptera: Cercopidae) distribution is controlled largely by genetic variation for resistance to a suite of branch-causing herbivores. These herbivores induce branching and aphids and spittlebugs are more abundant on branched plants than unbranched plants. These results indicate that any natural selection imposed by aphids and spittlebugs on goldenrod will depend on the presence or absence of branch-causing herbivores. Thus, selection for plant resistance may depend as much on the assemblage of insect species present as on the identity of each individual species.","DUKE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, DURHAM, NC 27706 USA",,,,,,,,52,49,55,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,OCT,1992,46,5,,,,,1358,1372,,10.2307/2409942,,,15,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,JV371,WOS:A1992JV37100008,28568992,Bronze,,,2021-09-21,

Oksanen et al. The pelagic habitat of the most unproductive lakes lacked secondary carnivores (piscivores), whereas secondary carnivores inhabited the more productive lakes in agreement with the assumption that food chain length is limited by the productivity of the system. The observed relationships between planktivores (primary carnivores), zooplankton (herbivores), and phytoplankton (primary producers) were in agreement with the predictions of the Oksanen et al. model for three- and four-trophic-link systems. Piscivore relationships were significant only when the biomass of piscivorous perch only was used as the independent variable (piscivorous perch amounted to greater-than-or-equal-to 97% of total piscivore biomass in five out of six four-link systems). The results suggest that gross patterns of food web dynamics in temperate lakes may be collapsed into food chain dynamics. However, as the higher trophic levels of most lakes were dominated by the same two species, an alternative hypothesis is that the simplicity of the food webs studied allowed food chain dynamics to approximate food web dynamics. The food chain model tested gave accurate predictions of trophic-level relationships within the rather narrow productivity range studied. However, previous data suggest that, due to size-structured interactions, secondary carnivores (piscivores) play a minor role in highly productive systems, a circumstance that may explain the postulated increase in mortality rate of zooplankton with increasing productivity. The observed increase in number of trophic levels with productivity does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between productivity and food chain length, as lake productivity is also correlated with structural complexity (in the form of submerged vegetation and an oxygenated hypolimnion). Habitat heterogeneity may thus influence food chain length, and in general it is likely that food chain length will depend on more than one environmental variable.","DEPT ECOL LIMNOL,S-22100 LUND,SWEDEN","PERSSON, L (corresponding author), UMEA UNIV,DEPT ANIM ECOL,S-90187 UMEA,SWEDEN.",,"Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013; Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; ",,,,97,199,205,1,64,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 S WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

The family is divided into three genera: Eua has four species, confined to Tonga and Samoa; Samoana has about 23 species, widely but sporadically distributed in Polynesia and the Mariana Islands; Partula has about 100 species, distributed from Belau to the Society Islands. This review integrates this systematic and biogeographic knowledge with work on ecology, population genetics and speciation that has concentrated especially on the recently speciated Partula spp. of Moorea in the Society Islands. Explanations of Moorean diversity (much of which seems unrelated to ecological factors) based on parapatric speciation and the evolution of morph ratio clines in the absence of isolation have predominated, although without incontrovertible support. Unitary explanations are probably not appropriate. Rather little is known of the basic biology of partulids. They are generally arboreal; feed on a wide range of partially decayed and living plant material; and are relatively long-lived, slow reproducing, ovoviviparous, cross- or self-fertilizing hermaphrodites. The phylogenetic and geographical origins of the three genera are unknown. Partula may have evolved, somewhere unknown, from Samoana, which evolved from Eua in the Tonga-Samoa region, this being the region of origin of Eua; but the opposite sequence has also been postulated. The question is unresolved. Origins of the Moorean species are better understood as their inter-relationships are relatively clear. Rather few dispersal events probably took place and the Society Island fauna as a whole may be derived from but two colonization events - first by a Samoana sp. and later by a Partula sp., both of which then speciated in situ - with a few intra-archipelago colonization events taking place subsequently, predominantly in a southwesterly direction from the older to the younger islands. Many of the questions posed by the group may never be answered. Some species, notably those of Moorea, are already extinct in the wild; others are severely threatened. Artificial introductions of both plants and animals, combined with urban and agricultural development, have had significant impacts, but ill-conceived biological control programmes, targeted at the Giant African Snail, Achatina fulica, constitute currently the most serious threat. However, significant areas are still open to research. Analysis of DNA variation, combined with modern ideas of Pacific biogeography, should allow the whole range from the broad origins of the fauna to the detailed evolution within groups of species to be addressed. Some species may yet be relatively secure in the wild and allow field studies, but extraction of DNA from museum specimens provides an exciting opportunity to continue unravelling the evolutionary history of these endangered snails and to contribute further to our understanding of evolutionary processes and the biogeography of the Pacific.",,"COWIE, RH (corresponding author), BERNICE P BISHOP MUSEUM, POB 19000A, HONOLULU, HI 96817 USA.",,"Cowie, Robert/AAM-9509-2020",,,,,264,109,117,1,26,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8436,1471-2970,,PHILOS T R SOC B,Philos.

This scale was large enough to allow line-transect estimates of lizard abundance, which were related to quantitative (and when possible multivariate) measurements of the structure and floristic composition of vegetation, the abundance of arthropod prey, the relative density of other lizard species, and the climatic data obtained from nearby meteorological stations. Neither the climate not the abundance of other lizards seemed to condition the quantitative distribution of the species. The positive influence of broad-leaved forests on the abundance of P. algirus appeared to be a consequence of structure attributes more directly related to the ecology of lizards than floristic composition per se. Thus, population levels were most highly correlated with the cover of shrubs over 20 cm in height, and once this structural requirement was met, they increased with the abundance of potential prey (itself conditioned by vegetation cover at the ground level and litter cover). We suggest that our results should be interpreted in the context of thermoregulatory, predator avoidance and movement minimization strategies whose influence on survival, and hence abundance, could probably be applied to other insectivorous lizards from temperate zones.","CSIC,MUSEO NACL CIENCIAS NAT,UEI VERTEBRADOS,E-28006 MADRID,SPAIN","DIAZ, JA (corresponding author), UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,FAC BIOL,DEPT BIOL ANIM VERTEBRADOS,E-28040 MADRID,SPAIN.",,"Diaz, Jose A./H-5559-2015; Carrascal, Luis M./Q-2190-2016; Carrascal, Luis M./B-8381-2008","Diaz, Jose A./0000-0001-6047-5065; Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531",,,,53,77,81,0,25,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0305-0270,,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Three levels of pH (4.3, 4.6, or 6.0) and three levels of density (0, 30 or 60 embryos) were arranged in a blocked design and replicated three times for Hyla gratiosa. At the end of this experiment the effects of pH (4.3, 4.6, or 6.0), density of H. femoralis (30 or 60), and prior use by H. gratiosa (at 0, 30, or 60 larvae per tank) on the survival and growth of H. femoralis, were examined. Higher density increased larval period and decreased size at metamorphosis of H. gratiosa. Lower pH decreased survival rate and also decreased size at metamorphosis. Body sodium concentrations were lowest at the low pH values. Lower pH increased the susceptibility of H. gratiosa tadpoles to the adverse effects of higher densities. For H. femoralis higher density decreased survival, increased larval period and decreased size at metamorphosis. Hyla femoralis also had lower survivorship at low pH and exhibited decreased size at metamorphosis. However, unlike the results with Hyla gratiosa, there were no interactive effects between pH and density for any of the life-history traits studied. The effect of previous colonization by H. gratiosa on H. femoralis survival was facilitative. Body sodium concentrations of H. femoralis were lowest at the highest pH value. Metamorphs of the same size had much lower levels of sodium in H. femoralis than H. gratiosa. In general, H. femoralis was less affected by pH variation than H. gratiosa. These results demonstrate that abiotic factors can interact strongly with biotic effects such as density and they suggest that interspecific interactions can be strongly modulated by the background abiotic environment.","FLORIDA STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,TALLAHASSEE,FL 32306","WARNER, SC (corresponding author), PENN STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,MUELLER LAB 208,UNIV PK,PA 16802, USA.",,,,,,,45,51,54,0,25,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,,1991,88,3,,,,,331,339,,10.1007/BF00317575,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GP207,WOS:A1991GP20700005,28313793,,,,2021-09-21,

FMR-values (kj/day) did not differ between species in spite of the 20% difference in body mass between the coal tit (9g) and the other two species (11-11.5 g). As a consequence, coal tits had significantly higher metabolic intensities (multiples of basal metabolism) than the larger species. Coal tits tended to fly more frequently while foraging than the other species. Maintenance (basal metabolism plus thermoregulation) accounts for 90% of FMR for the willow tit (according to published laboratory measurements), which is the highest value yet reported for any bird species. The coal tit expends as much energy as predicted by allometric equations, while the other two species have surprisingly low field metabolic rates for their body size. The pattern found may explain the migratory tendencies and more southerly distribution of the coal tit. Energy-saving mechanisms may be more important than mere consequences of body size to explain the northern distribution of small wintering birds.","[Moreno, J.; Carlson, A.; Alatalo, R.

Combined with circular economy requirements, a valorization method for waste, especially banana waste, was to convert them into adsorbents with advanced properties. The banana waste, after thermal treatment, was used with high removal performances (100%) for the removal of heavy metals, such as Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn, but their small particle size makes them very hard to recover and reuse. For this reason, a biopolymeric matrix was used to incorporate the banana waste. The matrix was chosen for its remarkable properties, such as low cost, biodegradability, low carbon footprint, and reduced environmental impact. In this research, different types of materials (simple banana peel ash BPA and combined with biopolymeric matrix, ALG-BPA, CS-BPA) were prepared, characterized, and tested. The materials were characterized by means of attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and tested for the removal of metal ions from synthetic solutions using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The ALG-BPA material proved to be the most efficient in the removal of heavy metal ions from synthetic solution, reaching even 100% metal removal for Cr, Fe, Pb, and Zn, while the CS-based materials were the least efficient, presenting the best values for Cr and Fe ions with a removal efficiency of 34.14% and 28.38%, respectively. By adding BPA to CS, the adsorption properties of the material were slightly improved, but also only for Cr and Fe ions, to 37.09% and 57.78%.","[Negroiu, Mihai; Covaliu, Cristina Ileana] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Fac Biotech Syst Engn, 313 Spl Independentei, Bucharest 060042, Romania; [Turcanu, Anca Andreea] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Ctr Res & Ecomet Expertise, 313 Spl Independentei, Bucharest 060042, Romania; [Matei, Ecaterina; Rapa, Maria; Predescu, Andra Mihaela; Pantilimon, Cristian Mircea; Coman, George; Predescu, Cristian] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Fac Mat Sci & Engn, 313 Spl Independetei, Bucharest 060042, Romania","Turcanu, AA (corresponding author), Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Ctr Res & Ecomet Expertise, 313 Spl Independentei, Bucharest 060042, Romania.; Matei, E (corresponding author), Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Fac Mat Sci & Engn, 313 Spl Independetei, Bucharest 060042, Romania.",negroiu.mihai@yahoo.com; andreea.turcanu90@yahoo.com; ecaterina.matei@upb.ro; rapa_m2002@yahoo.com; cristina_covaliu@yahoo.com; andra.predescu@upb.ro; mircea.pantilimon@upb.ro; george.coman@upb.ro; cristian.predescu@upb.ro,,"Rapa, Maria/0000-0001-7359-5736","Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation, CCCDI-UEFISCDI within PNCDI IIIConsiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI) [26PCCDI/01.03.2018]; European Regional Development Fund through Competitiveness Operational Program 2014-2020, Priority axis 1 [P_36_611, 107066]; Innovative Technologies for Materials Quality Assurance in Health, Energy and Environmental-Center for Innovative Manufacturing Solutions of Smart Biomaterials and Biomedical Surfaces-INOVABIOMED","This work was supported by a grant from the Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation, CCCDI-UEFISCDI, project number 26PCCDI/01.03.2018, Integrated and sustainable processes for environmental clean-up, wastewater reuse and waste valorization (SUSTENVPRO), within PNCDI III.

Contrary to expectations, the reactor inoculated with the pre-enriched consortium was not able to maintain its initial good performance in the long run, and the bioelectrochemical activity collapsed after three months of operation. On the other hand, the reactor inoculated with anaerobic sludge, although it required a relatively longer time to produce any observable current, was able to maintain an electrogenic activity operation (0.8 A m(-2)), whilst showcasing the positive contribution of AD-MET integration into tackling propionate accumulation and enhancing methane yield (338 mL gCOD(-1)).

The obtained post-consumer rPP composites were characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mechanical analyses (tensile, density, hardness, VICAT softening temperature (VST), heat deflection temperature (HDT), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), IZOD strength) and thermal analyses (differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)). Weight reduction and improvement of the tensile, elongation, impact strength, thermal stability, as well as melt processing of post-consumer recycled polypropylene (rPP) properties compounded with thermoplastic elastomers and glass bubbles, sustain the use of these formulations for engineering applications.","[Rapa, Maria; Coman, George; Berbecaru, Andrei Constantin; Matei, Ecaterina; Predescu, Cristian] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Ctr Res & Ecomet Expertise ECOMET UPB, 313 Spl Independentei, Bucharest 060042, Romania; [Spurcaciu, Bogdan Norocel; Nicolae, Cristian Andi; Gabor, Raluca Augusta; Ghioca, Paul Niculae] Natl Inst Res & Dev Chem & Petrochem Icech, 202 Spl Independentei, Bucharest 060021, Romania","Matei, E (corresponding author), Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Ctr Res & Ecomet Expertise ECOMET UPB, 313 Spl Independentei, Bucharest 060042, Romania.; Spurcaciu, BN (corresponding author), Natl Inst Res & Dev Chem & Petrochem Icech, 202 Spl Independentei, Bucharest 060021, Romania.",rapa_m2002@yahoo.com; bogdansssss@hotmail.com; g.coman@hotmail.com; ca_nicolae@yahoo.com; ralucagabor@yahoo.com; pghioca@yahoo.com; andrei_berbecaru@yahoo.com; ecaterinamatei@gmail.com; cpredescu56@yahoo.com,"Matei, Ecaterina/E-8044-2017; Predescu, Cristian/AAN-9722-2020; Rapa, Maria/I-4720-2019","Matei, Ecaterina/0000-0001-8672-9078; Rapa, Maria/0000-0001-7359-5736","European Union through POC Program [P_40_253, 130/23.09.2016, SMIS 105558, 5048/23.03.2018, 25501/18.12.2018]; European Regional Development Fund through Competitiveness Operational Program 2014-2020, Priority axis 1, Innovative Technologies for Materials Quality Assurance in Health, Energy and Environmental-Center for Innovative Manufacturing Solutions of Smart Bi [P_36_611, 107066]","This research was funded by the European Union through POC Program, Project ID: P_40_253, Contract 130/23.09.2016, SMIS 105558, Subsidiary Contract 5048/23.03.2018 and Subsidiary Contract 25501/18.12.2018.

The results of the photocatalytic tests showed that the highest efficiency of ampicillin removal from aqueous solution is obtained with the fiberglass fabric plain woven-type membrane. Although it has been shown that the rate of photocatalytic degradation of ampicillin is high, being practically eliminated within the first 30 min of photocatalysis, the degree of mineralization of the aqueous solution is low even after two hours of photocatalysis due to the degradation of PLA from the photocatalytic membrane. The instability of PLA in the reactive environment of the photocatalytic reactor, evidenced by morphological, mineralogical and spectroscopic analyzes as well as by kinetic studies, is closely related to the structure of the fiberglass membrane used as a support for PLA/TiO2 hybrid nanofibers.","[Bobirica, Constantin; Bobirica, Liliana; Orbeci, Cristina] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Dept Analyt Chem & Environm Engn, 1-7 Polizu, Bucharest 011061, Romania; [Rapa, Maria; Matei, Ecaterina; Predescu, Andra Mihaela] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Dept Metall Mat Proc & Ecomet, 313 Spl Independentei, Bucharest 060042, Romania","Orbeci, C (corresponding author), Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Dept Analyt Chem & Environm Engn, 1-7 Polizu, Bucharest 011061, Romania.",c_bobirica@yahoo.com; l_bobirica_ro@yahoo.com; rapa_m2002@yahoo.com; ecaterinamatei@yahoo.com; andrapredescu@yahoo.com; cristina.orbeci@upb.ro,"Bobirica, Constantin/ABF-1054-2020; Rapa, Maria/I-4720-2019; Bobirica, Constantin/ABB-9902-2020; Bobirica, Liliana/AAP-9552-2021; Bobirica, Liliana/ABF-1083-2020; Predescu, Andra/AAR-4087-2021; Matei, Ecaterina/E-8044-2017","Bobirica, Constantin/0000-0003-2172-6671; Rapa, Maria/0000-0001-7359-5736; Bobirica, Liliana/0000-0002-2725-0160; Matei, Ecaterina/0000-0001-8672-9078","Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation, CCCDI-UEFISCDI [26PCCDI/01.03.2018]; POC Program [49/05.09.2016, P_37_649]; European Regional Development Fund through Competitiveness Operational Program [P_36_611, 107066]; Innovative Technologies for Materials Quality Assurance in Health, Energy and Environmental-Center for Innovative Manufacturing Solutions of Smart Biomaterials and Biomedical Surfaces-INOVABIOMED","This research was funded by a grant of the Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation, CCCDI-UEFISCDI, project number 26PCCDI/01.03.2018, Integrated and sustainable processes for environmental clean-up, wastewater reuse and waste valorization (SUSTENVPRO), within PNCDI III and by POC Program, Grant no. 49/05.09.2016, Project ID P_37_649.

Depending upon the environmental context, saltmarsh plants can facilitate or suppress mangrove recruitment. A field study was conducted within a mosaic saltmarsh at the edge of a mangrove forest fringing Tampa Bay, FL, USA, to investigate whether mangrove recruitment is influenced by the species composition of saltmarsh patches within which mangroves develop. Propagules of Avicennia germinans were emplaced into experimental plots at the same tidal elevation representing 3 saltmarsh treatments: (1) Distichlis littoralis in monoculture, (2) Sporobolus virginicus in monoculture, and (3) polycultures containing D. littoralis, S. virginicus, and at least one other species. Significantly fewer seedlings established in S. virginicus monocultures than in D. littoralis monocultures. Seedling establishment within the saltmarsh polyculture was intermediate to the grass monoculture treatments. Herbivory was the most commonly observed source of mortality for mangrove propagules, and propagules were more susceptible to herbivory within monocultures of S. virginicus relative to D. littoralis monocultures. Our results suggest that patch-scale heterogeneity in saltmarsh groundcover may influence spatial patterns of mangrove herbivory and recruitment at landward forest margins. This study builds on prior investigations and demonstrates that interactions between the same mangrove and saltmarsh species may differ between sites. Understanding these context-dependent interactions among saltmarsh plants and mangrove recruits can be useful for forecasting distributional shifts of mangrove populations and for implementing mangrove restoration.","[Peterson, Jennifer M.; Bell, Susan S.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Bell, SS (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",sbell@usf.edu,,,,,,94,4,4,2,25,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Early 20th century naturalists regarded the coastal tundra of the Fennoscandian Low Arctic to be a stronghold for the species. At the start of our research in 2004, however, the local Arctic fox population was critically small and most neighbouring populations had been extirpated. Here, we synthesize the results of 11 years of research to highlight ecosystem drivers behind the critical state of the Arctic fox in Low-Arctic Fennoscandia. We identify two fundamental drivers: (1) an increasingly climate-driven irregularity of the lemming cycle and (2) a management and climate-driven increase in the abundance of red fox that is subsidized by more ungulate carrion. Arctic fox reproductive success is low when lemmings are scarce (despite high vole abundance), while red foxes exclude Arctic foxes from high-quality breeding territories in summer and from marine and terrestrial carrion in winter. Red fox culling on Varanger Peninsula may have prevented the extirpation of the Arctic fox population. However, one decade after the onset of this management action the Arctic fox population has failed to increase either because the action has been insufficient or because demographic and environmental stochasticity has precluded a positive response. We discuss options for future research and management of the Arctic fox in the Fennoscandian Low Arctic.","[Ims, Rolf A.; Killengreen, Siw T.; Ehrich, Dorothee; Hamel, Sandra; Henden, John-Andre; Jensvoll, Ingrid; Yoccoz, Nigel G.] Univ Tromso, Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, NO-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Flagstad, Oystein] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Trondheim, Norway","Ims, RA (corresponding author), Univ Tromso, Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, NO-9037 Tromso, Norway.",rolf.ims@uit.no,"Ehrich, Dorothee/F-6492-2015; Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014","Ehrich, Dorothee/0000-0002-3028-9488; Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039; Henden, John-Andre/0000-0002-8825-1167",Norwegian Environment Agency; Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway; Fram Centre,The Arctic fox in Finnmark project is financed by the Norwegian Environment Agency.

Aside from the unequal sample sizes involved with using this abundance-limited method, confounding factors potentially associated with levels of social interactions may also be introduced. The alternative, volume-limited method, i.e., varying the volume while maintaining equal numbers of animals, can provide a test for the presence of potentially confounding factors. Using tadpoles of Fowler's Toad, Anaxyrus fowleri, we examined the effect of density on growth rate, timing of metamorphosis, and size at metamorphosis in both abundance-limited and volume-limited experiments. We found no difference in tadpole growth rate or timing of metamorphosis between these two methods, but the metamorphs emerging from abundance-limited low density treatments were significantly smaller when compared to those in volume-limited low density treatments. Because toad tadpoles may naturally form social aggregations and schools, this suggests that the actual number of animals present may be important for normal social behavior and optimizing feeding rate. If volume-limited and abundance-limited methods of manipulating density are not equivalent, treatment method may itself be a factor that can differentially affect growth variables.","[Yagi, Katharine T.] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, 21111 Lakeshore Rd,Ste Anne Bellevue, Quebec City, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Yagi, Katharine T.; Green, David M.] McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, 859 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada","Green, DM (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Redpath Museum, 859 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C4, Canada.",katharine.yagi@mail.mcgill.ca; david.m.green@mcgill.ca,,,Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF); Wildlife Preservation Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"Financial support for this research came from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF), Wildlife Preservation Canada, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (grants to DMG).

From December 2005 to September 2008, seven crab-eating foxes Cerdocyon thous, seven brown-nosed coatis Nasua nasua, and six ocelots Leopardus pardalis were radio-collared and monitored. Camera trap data on these species were also collected for the crab-eating raccoon Procyon cancrivorus. We hypothesized that there would be large niche differentiation in preferred habitat-type or active period between generalist species with similar diet, and higher similarity in habitat-type or activity time between the generalist species (crab-eating foxes and coatis) and the more specialized ocelot. Individual home ranges were estimated using the utilization distribution index (UD-95% fixed Kernel). With data obtained from radio-collared individuals, we evaluated habitat selection using compositional analysis. Median home range size of ocelots was 8 km(2). The proportion of habitats within the home ranges of ocelots did not differ from the overall habitat proportion in the study area, but ocelots preferentially used forest within their home range. The median home range size of crab-eating foxes was 1.4 km(2). Foxes showed second-order habitat selection and selected savanna over shrub-savanna vegetation. The median home range size for coati was 1.5 km(2). Coati home ranges were located randomly in the study area. However, within their home range, coatis occurred more frequently in savanna than in other vegetation types. Among the four species, the overlap in activity period was the highest (87%) between ocelots and raccoons, with the least overlap occurring between the ocelot and coati (25%). We suggest that temporal segregation of carnivores was more important than spatial segregation, notably between the generalist coati, crab-eating fox and crab-eating raccoon.","[Bianchi, Rita de Cassia] Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Biol Aplicada Agr, Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil; [Olifiers, Natalie] IOC FIOCRUZ, Lab Biol Parasitol Mamiferos Silvestres Reservati, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Olifiers, Natalie] Univ Veiga Almeida, Maracana, RJ, Brazil; [Gompper, Matthew E.] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resources, Columbia, MO USA; [Mourao, Guilherme] Embrapa Pantanal, Corumba, MG, Brazil","Bianchi, RD (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, Dept Biol Aplicada Agr, Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil.",ritacbianchi@gmail.com,"Mourao, Guilherme M/C-3319-2013; de Cassia Bianchi, Rita/E-5504-2012; Olifiers, Natalie/N-5478-2019","Mourao, Guilherme M/0000-0002-8300-4191; de Cassia Bianchi, Rita/0000-0001-8027-755X; Olifiers, Natalie/0000-0002-3024-2049",CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [484501/2006-2]; FundectFundacao de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento do Ensino Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul (FUNDECT MS) [6654.235.476.06032007]; Embrapa MacroprogramaEmpresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); Fiocruz; Embrapa PantanalEmpresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); CAPESCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); University of Missouri,"Funds were provided by CNPq (Process #484501/2006-2), Fundect (Process #6654.235.476.06032007), Embrapa Macroprograma, Fiocruz and Embrapa Pantanal.

We studied these variations in a population of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in the tundra and taiga of northern Sweden. We analysed 12 years (1974-1985) of snow tracking data from a large area of 65,375 km(2). Specifically, we evaluated to what extent the distribution of red foxes was explained by the presence of prey and how this interacted with snow depth and altitude. We also tested for temporal linear trends in the distribution and abundance of red foxes during the study period. The distribution of red foxes was explained by the presence of rodents, hares, tetraonid species, and ungulates (i.e. carcasses). Snow depth had a negative effect on the impact of small prey on the distribution of the red foxes, whereas it had a positive effect on the impact of ungulates. The influence of hares increased with altitude. Neither distribution nor abundance of red foxes showed a positive or negative linear trend, suggesting a stable population in northern Sweden during our study. This study showed that the distribution of red foxes was not only influenced by the presence of their main prey (rodents), but also by interactions between alternative prey, altitude, and snow depth. This study also emphasizes the importance of ungulate carcasses for red foxes and for wildlife management.","[Carricondo-Sanchez, David; Odden, Morten; Willebrand, Tomas] Hedmark Univ Coll, Fac Appl Ecol & Agr Sci, N-2780 Koppang, Norway; [Samelius, Gustaf] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Samelius, Gustaf] Snow Leopard Trust, 4649 Sunnyside Ave North,Suite 325, Seattle, WA 98103 USA","Carricondo-Sanchez, D (corresponding author), Hedmark Univ Coll, Fac Appl Ecol & Agr Sci, N-2780 Koppang, Norway.",david.carricondo.sanchez@gmail.com,,"Carricondo Sanchez, David/0000-0001-6564-9108",,,,64,12,12,0,76,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1612-4642,1439-0574,,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur.

In particular, despite the importance of aggression in mediating social dominance, few studies have considered how heterospecific aggression might contribute to the maintenance or divergence of different colour morphs. To redress this gap, we carried out a field-based study in a Nicaraguan crater lake to investigate patterns of heterospecific aggression directed by the cichlid fish, Hypsophrys nicaraguensis, towards colour polymorphic cichlids in the genus Amphilophus. We found that H. nicaraguensis was the most frequent territorial neighbour of the colour polymorphic A. sagittae. Furthermore, when manipulating territorial intrusions using models, H. nicaraguensis were more aggressive towards the gold than dark colour morph of the sympatric Amphilophus species, including A. sagittae. Such a pattern of heterospecific aggression should be costly to the gold colour morph, potentially accounting for its lower than expected frequency and, more generally, highlighting the importance of considering heterospecific aggression in the context of morph frequencies and coexistence in the wild.","[Lehtonen, Topi K.] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Turku 20014, Finland; [Lehtonen, Topi K.] Abo Akad Univ, Dept Biosci, FIN-20520 Turku, Finland; [Sowersby, Will; Wong, Bob B.

However, there is a possibility that native species that occupy the same habitats may influence the population performance of Ae. albopictus, potentially affecting the establishment of this species in Australia. Cohabitation experiments were performed with the endemic Aedes notoscriptus (Skuse), which has been found occupying the same larval habitats as Ae. albopictus in the Torres Strait and is the most widespread container-inhabiting Aedes species in Australia. The influence of environmental factors and cohabitation between the two species was examined using different climates, food resource levels, food resource types, and species densities. Survivorship proportions and a population performance index (lambda') were calculated and compared. The consequences of increased Ae. notoscriptus densities were reduced survivorship and lambda' for Ae. albopictus. Despite this, the mean lambda' of Ae. albopictus and Ae. notoscriptus was consistently >= 1.06, indicating both species could increase under all conditions, potentially due to increasing conspecific densities negatively affecting Ae. notoscriptus. The outcomes from this study suggest that the preexisting presence of Ae. notoscriptus may not prevent the establishment of Ae. albopictus in Australia.","[Nicholson, J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Pathol & Lab Med, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Nicholson, J.; Van den Hurk, A.

There are indications that ensuing changes to the benthic invertebrate community may increase the availability of food and promote growth and even fisheries yield of target fish species. If and how this occurs is the subject of ongoing debate, with evidence both in favour and against. We model the effects of trawling on a simple ecosystem of benthivorous fish and two food populations (benthos), susceptible and resistant to trawling. We show that the ecosystem response to trawling depends on whether the abundance of benthos is top-down or bottom-up controlled. Fishing may result in higher fish abundance, higher (maximum sustainable) yield and increased persistence of fish when the benthos which is the best-quality fish food is also more resistant to trawling. These positive effects occur in bottom-up controlled systems and systems with limited impact of fish feeding on benthos, resembling bottom-up control. Fishing leads to lower yields and fish persistence in all configurations where susceptible benthos are more profitable prey. Our results highlight the importance of mechanistic ecosystem knowledge as a requirement for successful management.","[van Denderen, P.

Most of the studies on eco-evolutionary dynamics have been concerned with direct trophic interactions. However, community ecologists have shown that trait-mediated indirect effects play an important role in shaping the structure of natural communities. In particular, in terrestrial plant-insect systems, indirect effects mediated through herbivore-induced plant responses are common and have a great impact on the structure of herbivore communities. This review describes eco-evolutionary dynamics in herbivorous insect communities, and specifically focuses on the key role of herbivore-induced plant responses in eco-evolutionary dynamics. First, I review studies on the evolution of herbivore traits relevant to plant induction and discuss evolution in a community context mediated by induced plant responses. Second, I highlight how intraspecific genetic variation or evolution in herbivore traits can influence herbivore community structure. Finally, I propose the hypothetical model that induced plant responses supports eco-evolutionary feedback in herbivore communities. In this review, I argue that the application of the indirect interaction web approaches into studies on eco-evolutionary will provide profound insights into understanding of mechanisms of the generation and maintenance of biodiversity.","[Utsumi, Shunsuke] Univ Tokyo, Dept Gen Syst Studies, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Utsumi, Shunsuke] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Biol, Joensuu 80101, Finland; [Utsumi, Shunsuke] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga 5202113, Japan","Utsumi, S (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Gen Syst Studies, Meguro Ku, 3-8-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538902, Japan.",csutsumi@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Utsumi, Shunsuke/0000-0003-1558-8073","Global COE programMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [A06]; Japan Society of the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [22-9260]",I am grateful to Takayuki Ohgushi for providing me the opportunity to talk in the symposium in the 25th annual meeting of the Society of Population Ecology and write this manuscript.

Yet, the species-specific distribution of these sympatric gammarids has not been well studied in the northern Baltic Sea. This study was undertaken to assess the spatial distribution of gammarid amphipods along wave exposure and depth gradients to study whether they show segregation in their microhabitat use. We sampled 12 rocky sublittoral shores along a wave exposure gradient over a period of 5 years. Samples differed with respect to depth and macroalgal type. Three of the five gammarid species occurred mainly in different depth zones and among different macroalgae at the exposed shores. In contrast, on protected shores, where algal zonation is weaker, a link to zonation and macroalgal type was almost absent. Moreover, the microhabitat use was strongest during the reproductive seasons of the species. The observed microhabitats of the three gammarid species fit well to their species-specific mean body sizes.","[Korpinen, Samuli] Helsinki Commiss, Helsinki 00160, Finland; [Korpinen, Samuli; Westerbom, Mats] Tvarminne Zool Stn, SF-10900 Hango, Finland; [Westerbom, Mats] Nat Heritage Serv, Ekenas 10600, Finland","Korpinen, S (corresponding author), Helsinki Commiss, Katajanokanlaituri 6B, Helsinki 00160, Finland.",samuli.korpinen@helcom.fi,"Westerbom, Mats/AAC-6230-2021","Korpinen, Samuli/0000-0001-6024-1250; Westerbom, Mats/0000-0002-3936-9396",Walter and Andree de Nottbeck Foundation,The authors are grateful to the staff of the Tvarminne Zoological Station for their kind help during the Weld season and to Walter and Andree de Nottbeck Foundation for financial support.

For different studies on life history plasticity to be comparable, there must be clearly defined and commonly agreed transition points, but it is unclear how consistently this is being performed in studies using anuran amphibians. In a review of 157 published studies, I found considerable variation in defining the end point of the larval phase. While a slight majority used the emergence of the forelimbs as the conclusion of the larval phase, some used a period within the developmental phase of metamorphic climax and others used the resorption of the tail. Studies included in this review, that assessed the same life history variable at two different developmental stages, reported some differences in results depending on which developmental stage was used. Recent evidence also shows that metamorphic climax is itself a period which can vary with environmental conditions, but, even in studies that included part or all of metamorphic climax in the larval phase, the treatment of individuals during metamorphic climax was not reported. Therefore, I argue that life history studies on anuran amphibians should distinguish the following phases: larval, metamorphic climax, juvenile, adult; that the end of the larval phase is best defined in ecological studies by forelimb emergence and that conditions under which individuals undergo metamorphic climax should be fully described.","[Walsh, Patrick Thomas] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Div Environm & Evolutionary Biol, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","Walsh, PT (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Psychol, St Andrews KY16 9JP, Fife, Scotland.",Patrick.Walsh@st-andrews.ac.uk,,,Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland,"I thank Roger Downie, Pat Monaghan, Sue Healy, Richard Griffiths and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on this manuscript.

We used a set of field methods to assess species presence and relative frequency of observation. The network of ponds was inhabited by six species of amphibians, two salamanders and four frogs. The breeding phenology of the six species did not vary remarkably among ponds, but there were significant differences among species in use of ponds. Factorial analysis of pond similarity drawn from percentage composition of the amphibian fauna, revealed that each of the four ponds was treatable as independent units, with no influence of relative inter-pond distance. PCA analysis allowed us to spatially arrange the amphibian species into three main groups: two were monospecific groups (i.e., Triturus Vulgaris and Bufo bufo) and the third consisted of those species that selected not only the largest-deepest ponds, but also the ephemeral ones (i.e., Triturus carnifex, Hyla intermedia, the green frogs and Rana dalmatina). Our results suggest that the inter-pond differences in riparian vegetation, water depth, aquatic vegetation structure/abundance, and soil composition may produce differences among pond ecological characteristics (i.e., water turbidity and temperature, shelter availability, abundance of oviposition micro-sites), which may in turn influence different patterns of use by amphibians. To our knowledge, this is the first study emphasizing the potential role of heterochrony in the maintenance of a high species richness in Mediterranean amphibian communities. Preservation of freshwater vertebrate biodiversity requires management and protection not only of the main ponds and water bodies but also the temporary and ephemeral shallow ponds.

Field surveys and manipulative experiments demonstrated that intraspecific density and sediment organic matter (SOM) content of sediments are among the factors that regulate the proportion of sand dollars that forage as deposit versus suspension feeders. High local density was associated with a lower proportion of deposit feeding animals in both field surveys and under controlled experimental conditions. Conversely, the proportion of deposit feeders was elevated in treatments in which SOM levels were subsidized, regardless of local density. These data fit Levinton's model of resource limitation in relation to deposit-and suspension-feeding communities, and expand the list of biological processes regulated through density dependence. Analyses of carbon stable isotope ratios (delta C-13) of sand dollars and their potential sources of primary production suggest individuals rely primarily on suspended particulate organic carbon (POC) or drift macroalgae. Sediment organic matter was not a substantial source of carbon for most individuals. There was a significant inverse relationship between size and delta C-13 values; smaller individuals depended to a greater extent on macroalgae. There was no consistent relationship between isotopic ratios, feeding mode and density, which may be due to the high mobility of the species, their ability to respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions and the dynamic nature of their habitat. Our results suggest that biological interactions influence feeding mode of this species. This is a complementary mechanism to those described previously, in which physical factors such as flow and lift/washout have been shown to regulate sand dollar positioning. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Four categories of studies have been reviewed herein; infective juvenile foraging strategies, recognition and evaluation of the host by infective juveniles, the actual behaviors of infective juveniles that result in infection, and the protective role of the symbiotic bacteria during nematode reproduction in the cadaver. This constitutes a chronological order of events. Two challenges are suggested. First, the data on entomopathogenic nematode behavioral ecology, while very extensive for some species, are almost completely lacking for most described species. We need to approach future studies paying more attention to phylogenetic origins of the traits that we study. Second, there is little consensus on exactly what are the traits that are worth studying. By reviewing and synthesizing current work, we make some suggestions about where future research should be directed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Location: Vicinity of Chinchon, province of Madrid, Spain (40 degrees 11'N,3 degrees 35'W, 550 m a.s.l.) Methods: We evaluated the effects of neighbours on the survival and growth of naturally emerging Heliantheinum seedlings in a semi-arid area during a two-year period. We followed a two-fold approach based on the use of neighbour models for seedling survival and growth and spatial point pattern analyses for seedling emergence, taking into account the germination date. Results: Seedlings appeared clumped in the vicinity of mature Helianthemum individuals. The neighbour models fitted showed that interactions with neighbours were extremely important for the survival and growth of Helianthemum seedlings. These models also suggest that the effects of neighbours on these variables vary with changes in spatial scale and in the abiotic conditions. Some species exerted negative or positive effects on Helianthemum seedlings only at certain spatial scales, and others exerted negative or positive effects at earlier stages of seedling development, but none later and vice versa. Conclusions: We suggest that the observed patterns are mainly influenced by small-scale modifications in soil conditions and microclimate created by neighbours, which change in time and space.","Univ Rey Juan Carlos, ESCET, Unidad Biodivers & Conservac, E-28933 Mostoles, Spain; Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSI, Dept Biol Vegetal, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Escudero, A (corresponding author), Univ Rey Juan Carlos, ESCET, Unidad Biodivers & Conservac, E-28933 Mostoles, Spain.",a.escudero@escet.urjc.es,"Escudero, Adrian/H-5046-2015; de la Cruz, Marcelino/M-6124-2015; Maestre, Fernando T./A-6825-2008","Escudero, Adrian/0000-0002-1427-5465; de la Cruz, Marcelino/0000-0002-9080-4525; Maestre, Fernando T./0000-0002-7434-4856",,,,52,37,41,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,1654-1103,,J VEG SCI,J.

However, considerable debate exists over whether multiple natural enemies often interact to produce additive or non-additive effects on their prey or host populations. Based on the large data set stored in the Sao Joao and Barra sugarcane mills (state of Sao Paulo, Brazil) regarding the programme of biological control of Diatraea saccharalis using the parasitoids Cotesia flavipes and tachinid flies, in the present study the author investigated whether the parasitoids released into sugarcane fields interfered significantly with the rate of parasitized D. saccharalis hosts. The author also observed whether there was an additive effect of releasing C. flavipes and tachinids on the rate of parasitized hosts, and looked for evidence of possible negative effects of the use of multiple parasitoid species in this biological control programme. Results showed that C. flavipes and the tachinids were concomitantly released in the Barra Mill, but not in the Sao Jao Mill. Furthermore, in the Barra Mill there was evidence that the parasitoids interacted because the percentage of parasitism did not increase after the release of either C. flavipes or tachinids. In the Sao Joao Mill, when both parasitoid species were released out of synchrony, both the percentage of parasitism by C. flavipes as well as that of the tachinids increased. When large numbers of tachinids were released in the Barra Mill, they caused a significant lower percentage of parasitism imposed by C. flavipes. The implications of the results as evidence of non-additive effects of C. flavipes plus tachinids on D. saccharalis populations are discussed.","Univ Estadual Paulista, IB, Dept Parasitol, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil","Rossi, MN (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Paulista, IB, Dept Parasitol, Rubiao Jr, BR-18618000 Botucatu, SP, Brazil.",rossilife@fca.unesp.br,"Rossi, Marcelo N/D-8876-2013",,,,,32,2,2,1,6,BLACKWELL VERLAG GMBH,BERLIN,"KURFURSTENDAMM 57, D-10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",1439-0418,,,J APPL ENTOMOL,J.

Introduced plants generally have lower generalist herbivore loads than native plants. Herbivores may be avoiding a potentially edible food source (Behavioural Constraint Hypothesis) or defences of introduced plants may be unusually toxic (Novel Defence Hypothesis). 2. To examine these hypotheses, acridid grasshoppers (Melanoplus angustipennis and Orphullela pelidna) were enclosed in a Texas grassland. Each enclosure contained native prairie vegetation and a seedling of either introduced Sapium sebiferum (Chinese tallow tree) or native Celtis laevigata (hackberry). Sapium invades many ecosystems in the south-east U.S.A. Celtis seedlings also establish in these ecosystems. 3. Although grasshoppers usually feed sparingly on Sapium, in field enclosures they fed heavily on this introduced tree species, supporting a role for behavioural avoidance. In laboratory feeding trials, M. angustipennis grasshoppers preferred Sapium foliage over the foliage of three native tree species. In a greenhouse experiment, M. angustipennis individuals fed more on Sapium in prairie mesocosms if they were conditioned on Sapium. 4. In another field experiment with single seedlings in enclosures, grasshoppers consumed similar amounts of Sapium from its introduced (Texas, U.S.A.) and native (China) ranges, suggesting that Sapium may have been a suitable host plant since it was introduced. Behavioural avoidance by generalist herbivores may contribute to Sapium's low herbivore load in its introduced range.","Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Houston, TX 77005 USA; Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Siemann, E (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol MS 170, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",siemann@rice.edu,"Lankau, Richard A/B-9760-2008","Lankau, Richard A/0000-0001-9995-328X",,,,45,59,69,2,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

In Britain, five indirect methods have been used to survey for the presence of red Sciurus vulgaris and grey squirrels S. carolinensis and to monitor population trends through time. These are: visual counts along line transects, the use of hair tubes, counts of dreys, cone line feeding transects in conifer forests and feeding signs on whole maize bait at feeding stations. 2. Drey counts and cone feeding transects cannot differentiate between red and grey squirrels and are not suitable for areas where both species may be present. Hair tubes require expertise and facilities to identify hairs to species, and the relationship between tube visits and animal density in different habitats is only known for red squirrels in Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis dominated plantations. Visual counts along line transects are the simplest method to do and require little equipment. However, in general, few squirrels are seen in a single count which leads to difficulties in estimating densities. 3. In this paper we present data from several studies carried out in Britain to illustrate the type of data that may be collected, and to evaluate their accuracy and precision with which they could detect population change. Hair tube lines and drey counts required the fewest number of samples to detect population change. When effort was also considered, visual transects and drey counts were more economical. However, none of the monitoring methods discussed is very precise and it may be best to monitor squirrels only in terms of relative changes in numbers or indices of numbers through time. 4. Our results for red and grey squirrels also illustrated that the number of samples required to detect population change is likely to differ according to the size of the survey area. Monitoring programmes should therefore be carefully planned in relation to spatial scale in order to be able to detect real population changes. Species-specific, quantitative thresholds to determine the significance of detected declines may need to be established for threatened UK mammals and assessed in relation to what would constitute a significant decline and whether it requires management intervention.","Univ London, Queen Mary, Sch Biol Sci, London E1 4NS, England; Newcastle Univ, Ctr Life Sci Modelling, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; Newcastle Univ, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; Thetford Forest Dist, Brandon IP27 0TJ, Suffolk, England","Gurnell, J (corresponding author), Univ London, Queen Mary, Sch Biol Sci, London E1 4NS, England.",j.gurnell@qmul.ac.uk,"Lurz, Peter/O-5108-2019","Shirley, Mark/0000-0002-6220-2578",,,,67,43,51,2,93,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-1838,1365-2907,,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,JAN-APR,2004,34,1-2,,,,,51,74,,10.1046/j.0305-1838.2003.00028.x,,,24,Ecology; Zoology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology,772WM,WOS:000188865100004,,,,,2021-09-21,

In this study we focused on overwintering birds of two close and contrasting forest habitats: a 60-120 years old oak forest and a secondary 10-20 years old wood that has lost most of its original vegetation because of continuous logging and is now dominated by an introduced species, black locust Robinia pseudoacacia. We examined bird use of the forests over two levels: species-habitat relationships and foraging niches. The former were assessed by means of point counts centred in 50 m radius plots, whereas the latter by observations of foraging behaviour and plant species exploitation. Mean species richness, diversity and abundance of bark foragers was significantly greater in the old-growth stand, where trees were higher and larger but stem density was lower. Almost no wintering bird species occurred at higher density in the second-growth than in old-growth forest, and no foraging birds positively selected the black locust as substrate. Despite the observed differences in biodiversity metrics and plant species exploitation, most birds of the two stands showed few shifts in their foraging behaviour (in terms of foraging technique, substrate, relative horizontal and vertical position) and niche metrics (breadth and overlap). By considering results obtained with the two approaches, we suggest that biodiversity of altered secondary woods can be increased if current silvicultural practices are modified towards (1) maintaining oaks or trees prone to snag formation such as old poplars and (2) preventing black locust establishment in post-clearcut communities.

This causes problems with data complexity, sampling (level) and independence. Many ecological programmes are currently conducting multi-scale investigation of organismal trends (e.g. diversity). In this study, by contrast, the assemblages analysed were the resources used by animals (rather than animals per se). Variability in shell use was studied in 5 members of a taxon (hermit crabs) from global to site spatial levels. The novel adaptation of an existing technique used 1-factor, 3-level ANOVA of Bray-Curtis similarity values based on 'centroids' for each scale. Similarity in the number of shells used, the proportional usage of shell types, shell diversity and other variables were examined at site (> 10 m apart), locality (> 1 km apart) and region levels (> 1000 km apart). There was significant variability amongst scales and between regions in shell use of all species. For some species, observed variability differed with location, while in others the trend was similar in all 3 regions. Between 18 and 3 shell types were used by different study species with diversity (Shannon H') values ranging from 2.54 to 0.1 and evenness values from 0.99 to 0.1. Shell use by hermit crabs was less similar (to each other) between regions than between the study hermit crab species. No significant spatial effects at any level were found on the proportion of damaged shells used by different species. The numbers of shell types used by hermit crabs had both a taxon-specific component and a global pattern. Data from the literature in combination with that from the present study showed Dardanus, Diogenes and Pagurus species used fewer shell types than Coenobita, Clibanarius and Calcinus species. No inter-oceanic patterns were evident in any genus. Shell numbers used by Clibanarius and Calcinus species both, however, exhibited distinct latitudinal clines. Adaptation of a novel technique has, thus, demonstrated global (and differential between scale) trends in resource use by a guild of animals, although interpretation of the mechanism or meaning underlying this is not straightforward.","FRONTIER, London EC2A 4QS, England; Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Zool & Anim Ecol, Cork, Ireland","Barnes, DKA (corresponding author), British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.",dkab@bas.ac.uk,,,,,,60,12,13,0,5,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

In order to test if there was any variation in species distribution and abundance in the upper and lower mid-shore zone (eulittoral) along the entire intertidal Portuguese coast, three main regions were studied (north, centre and south) and nine shores were visited in each region. At each one of the 27 locations, the shore was levelled and a general qualitative description was made, which also aided stratification of subsequent quantitative sampling. An upper zone (littoral fringe) characterised by the presence of encrusting lichens, small littorinid gastropods and cyanobacteria was found on most of the shores along the Portuguese coast. The mid-shore zone (eulittoral) is essentially dominated by barnacles and sometimes mussels. The distribution patterns observed on the lower shore (sub-littoral fringe) showed a distinction between northern shores, where large brown algae are present. and shores located in the central and southern regions, essentially dominated by red algal turf species. Multidimensional analysis and the ANOSIM test have revealed clear differences in the structure of the upper and lower mid-shore zone. Within each level, the northern region was considerably different from the south and central regions, SIMPER analysis revealed the species which contributed to the separation between shore levels and regions. It has also given important information on the geographical decline in abundance of species.","Univ Lisbon, Lab Maritimo Guia IMAR, P-2750374 Cascais, Portugal; Inst Invest Pescas & Mar, IMAR IPIMAR CripSul, P-8700 Olhao, Portugal; Univ Southampton, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Southampton, Hants, England; Marine Biol Assoc United Kingdom Lab, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England","Boaventura, D (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Lab Maritimo Guia IMAR, Estrada Guincho, P-2750374 Cascais, Portugal.",dianab@fc.ul.pt,"Re, Pedro/M-7374-2019; Boaventura, Diana/I-7191-2012; Re, Pedro PRe/A-6604-2011; da Fonseca, Luis MQ Cancela/I-5564-2012","Re, Pedro/0000-0002-4859-1466; Boaventura, Diana/0000-0002-3658-2925; Re, Pedro PRe/0000-0002-4859-1466; da Fonseca, Luis MQ Cancela/0000-0001-6527-0827",,,,73,110,115,2,95,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0173-9565,,,MAR ECOL-P S Z N I,Mar.

How natural selection has resulted in variation in adaptive strategies between species, however, is not well studied, and few empirical studies attempt to determine if changes in survival rate drive changes in reproduction, or if the causality is the other way around. I propose that a profitable approach to resolve this problem would be to compare life-history traits in different geographic populations of the same species. Variation in fecundity and adult survival rates across fourteen populations of Blue Tits Parus caeruleus are as large as those among eleven tits Parus spp., so that comparisons among these populations can help identify selective factors that influence reproduction and survival. In a set of populations of Great Tit Parus major and Blue Tit there exists a significant inverse relation between productivity (number of young fledged per female per season) and adult annual survival rates, but not between fecundity and survival rates. I discuss experiments that help to address the question of cause and effect, and conclude that variations in productivity cause variations in survival rates. I finally present different scenarios that propose evolutionary pathways illustrating how populations could evolve from one set of life-history traits to another.","Cornell Univ, Ornithol Lab, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Dhondt, AA (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Ornithol Lab, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",aad4@cornell.edu,"Dhondt, Andre/A-8292-2008","Dhondt, Andre/0000-0002-4946-1401",,,,43,29,29,0,27,NEDERLANDSE ORNITHOLOGISCHE UNIE,ZEIST,"C/O PAUL STARMANS, OUDE ARNHEMSEWEG 261, 3705 BD ZEIST, NETHERLANDS",0373-2266,2213-1175,,ARDEA,Ardea,,2001,89,1,,,SI,,155,166,,,,,12,Ornithology,Zoology,444ZF,WOS:000169431700016,,,,,2021-09-21,

We hypothesized that the presence of the shrubs Buxus sempervirens and Juniperus communis alter the rate and the pathway of the succession by facilitating the regeneration of Q. humilis. To infer the process of facilitation at a large scale, the spatial distribution of Q. humilis was studied in relation to acorn sources and the type of plant cover in grazed and ungrazed sites. Abundant recruitment up to 80 m from the wood margins and from isolated oak trees in grassland shows that acorns are dispersed effectively. At the three study sites, the density of Q. humilis individuals was higher under shrubs than in grassland, suggesting that facilitation may occur. This density difference was much higher in the grazed sites than in the ungrazed site. Moreover, before grazing by livestock, the distribution of first-year seedlings is independent of vegetation cover. Thus, shrubs improve Q. humilis regeneration by protecting individuals from grazing. The high density of individuals at the northern edge of shrubs suggests that a second facilitation mechanism may exist, probably related to improved germination conditions. Facilitation by shrubs appears to be very important for Q. humilis dynamics.","CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Lepart, J (corresponding author), CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",,,,,,,55,81,86,1,30,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,UPPSALA,"BOX 25137, S 752 25 UPPSALA, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

Correlations between body size and the use of foraging sites in trees are well described for European tits. Our results indicate that similar correlations exist in this Korean guild. There were significant differences among species in frequency of use of five foraging site categories in trees: trunks, branches, twigs, leaves, needles. The larger the species, the more often it used trunks and branches for foraging. There was a positive correlation between body-size difference and the difference in the foraging sites between species, indicating that species of similar body sizes foraged in similar sites in trees. For four species not specialized in using conifers (Parus varius, P. major, P. palustris, Aegithalos caudatus), there was a negative correlation between body size difference between species and the difference in the frequency of foraging in conifers, suggesting that birds of similar body sizes foraged in different tree species. We suggest a possible role of dominance in creating this relationship. This is one of the few reports of foraging niche differences among tits in temperate forests in Asia. This report is important in that it shows, for the first time, foraging niche differences in a previously unstudied guild of tits, and that the differences are correlated with size differences, just as in the well studied guild of tits in Europe.","Polish Acad Sci, Inst Ecol, PL-05092 Lomianki, Poland; Korea Environm Inst, Seoul 156090, South Korea","Jablonski, PG (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Ecol, PL-05092 Lomianki, Poland.",piotrjab@manduca.neurobio.arizona.edu; Leesd@keins.kei.re.kr,"Jablonski, Piotr/K-4231-2012",/0000-0002-8333-0106,,,,50,13,13,0,10,BIRDLIFE FINLAND,HELSINKI,"PO BOX 1285, HELSINKI, 00101, FINLAND",0030-5685,,,ORNIS FENNICA,Ornis Fenn.,,1999,76,1,,,,,17,23,,,,,7,Ornithology,Zoology,214XT,WOS:000081353400002,,,,,2021-09-21,

I then identified, characterized, and tabulated occurrences of the different types of community organization. In ten years of Ecology, there were 66 instances of habitat partitioning accompanied by experimental demonstrations of how the patterns were formed. Shared preferences and distinct preferences were most commonly cited as producing patterns of partitioning (34 and 17 times, respectively), but there were also 8 examples of one-sided preferences, 4 examples of centrifugal organization, and 3 instances of niche contraction. This indicates that a variety of community organizations can produce patterns of partitioning and that shared preferences may occur more frequently in nature than generally thought. The presence of particular types of organization was influenced by the kind of study organism, with shared preferences occurring more frequently than distinct preferences among autotrophs and among different-aged individuals of the same species. Distinct preferences occurred when species were partitioned on different hosts rather than along gradients, suggesting that the kinds of resources that species use in a habitat may also influence how patterns of partitioning are formed.","Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Wisheu, IC (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Dr Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",,,,,,,149,61,64,2,47,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,NOV,1998,83,2,,,,,246,258,,10.2307/3546836,,,13,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,137XJ,WOS:000076942100005,,,,,2021-09-21,

Biogeographical processes that influence speciation and extinction rates determine the size and composition of this regional species pool. Community ecologists are beginning to recognize the importance of these biogeographical processes in influencing diversity patterns among local communities, but the potential for local interactions to influence biogeographical processes, especially speciation, has been little considered. In this paper I discuss one mechanism by which variation in the strengths of local interactions can influence the potential for population differentiation and thus for influencing speciation rates in the allopatric model of speciation. When more than one selective agent acts on the phenotype, the shape of the overall fitness surface depends critically on the relative strengths of the various selective agents. If one selective agent, which imparts strong selection, acts in all populations of a species, population differentiation via adaptation to local ecological conditions or via differentiation of sexual systems is retarded because the overall fitness surface in all populations strongly resembles the shape of the strongest selective agent. Consequently, the potential for speciation is reduced. Alternatively, if selective agents in various populations impart relatively equitable strengths of selection, the potential for differences in the overall fitness surfaces among populations is enhanced, which will enhance the potential for population differentiation and thus speciation. Analogous results obtain when multiple selective agents impact genetically correlated characters. Because the strength of selection generated by a species interaction should increase with the strength of the interaction, and because fewer species can usually coexist when the strengths of interactions are greater, the number of coexisting species and the potential for speciation in component taxa may covary among communities. This analysis indicates that the relative strengths of interactions can be as important to diversification in communities as the number of niche dimensions along which differentiation can occur.",,"McPeek, MA (corresponding author), DARTMOUTH COLL, DEPT BIOL SCI, HANOVER, NH 03755 USA.",,"Langerhans, R.

If indirect effects have strong ecological effects, then they must also have strong evolutionary effects through natural selection. We consider how indirect effects, both positive and negative, combine with positive and negative direct effects to influence evolution between interacting species. Any one species can evolve in response to direct interactions with other species by changing its ''response'' to the presence of the other species or changing its ''effect'' on the species. We argue that the direction (positive or negative) of the direct and indirect effects will determine whether traits related to ''response'' or ''effect'' are most likely to be subject to natural selection. Further, covariance patterns of species in the same community should increase when direct and indirect effects between species act in the same direction, resulting in greater compartmentalization of such communities.",,"Miller, TE (corresponding author), FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, B-157, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA.",,,,,,,56,78,79,3,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,1996,77,5,,,,,1329,1335,,10.2307/2265530,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,UX396,WOS:A1996UX39600003,,,,,2021-09-21,

I sampled vegetation and counted birds in 90 hayfields of various ages (i.e. number of years since planting) and sizes that were originally planted to a legume-dominated seed mixture. I also resampled a subset of these fields two years later. Over time, these hayfields changed from tall, dense, homogeneous stands of legume-dominated vegetation to short, sparse, patchy stands of grass-dominated vegetation. Fields of all ages were dominated by introduced plant species. Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), the most common bird species breeding in these fields, were most common in fields of intermediate ages, whereas numbers of Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), the second most abundant species, increased logarithmically with field age. Upland Sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda), Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), and Henslow's Sparrows (A. henslowii) were most abundant in the oldest hayfields, whereas abundances of Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis, the third most common species) did not differ in fields of different ages. Bird-species richness and diversity increased linearly with hayfield age. Three species (Red-winged Blackbird, Bobolink, Savannah Sparrow) accounted for more than 90% of the breeding individuals. Vegetation structure, composition, and patch size were the most important proximate correlates of habitat selection for these species. Hayfield size was positively correlated with abundance for five of the seven most common species. Furthermore, those species that nested late in the season (Bobolinks, Grasshopper Sparrows, and Henslow's Sparrows) had low breeding densities in fields with early mowing dates the previous year.","CORNELL UNIV, DEPT NAT RESOURCES, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA",,,,,,,,53,72,73,1,20,AMER ORNITHOLOGISTS UNION,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897 USA",0004-8038,1938-4254,,AUK,AUK,JUL,1995,112,3,,,,,720,730,,,,,11,Ornithology,Zoology,TZ356,WOS:A1995TZ35600015,,,,,2021-09-21,

We tested the effects of food, in the form of leaf litter, and density on population growth and fitness correlates of the tree hole mosquito Aedes triseriatus. Our field experiment used a 2 x 2 randomized block design, with three holes as blocks. In cages within three holes, we manipulated densities of Aedes triseriatus larvae, and presence of leaf litter. Our laboratory experiment used a 2 x 3 factorial design in which we also manipulated densities of larvae and availability of leaf litter within similar cages (inside, outside, or absent). For both experiments we determined effects on survival, days to and mass at eclosion of both sexes, and a composite index of population performance lambda', that estimates finite rate of increase. 2. In the field experiment, we found significant and large effects of leaf litter and of density on the performance of A. triseriatus. The effect of density did not depend on leaf litter availability. We documented significant variation among tree holes for most correlates of fitness. Often, the effects of treatments varied significantly depending on the tree hole tested. 3. In the laboratory experiment we found significant effects of density and litter, and that direct browsing on leaf litter is necessary for the effect of litter on performance of A. triseriatus. In the laboratory, the negative effect of increased density was dependent on leaf litter availability. 4. Our results demonstrate that leaf litter has important effects on population performance of tree hole mosquitoes in natural tree holes, Direct browsing on the surface of leaf litter is the most likely mechanism by which litter enhances population growth. The impact of litter on populations varies among tree holes.","ILLINOIS STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,ECOL GRP,NORMAL,IL 61790",,,,"Juliano, Steven/0000-0002-6178-4553",,,,36,92,95,1,27,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

The number of epibionts (bacteria, diatoms, protozoa, fungi, macroorganisms) on Perna viridis shells and their potential defence mechanisms were studied. The number of epibionts on isolated mussels and those in patches were compared. Densities of protozoa and macrofauna were much higher on isolated specimens than on aggregated (patch forming) mussels. Among possible antifouling mechanisms which were studied sloughing, shell surface tension and surface-pH proved to be non effective in preventing fouling. Toxicity assays of shell extracts showed limited activity against bacteria and fungi. Grazing by two different gastropod species (Planaxis sulcatus, Thais sp.) reduced the number of protozoa and macroorganisms on isolated and aggregated mussels.

This approach has been widely used to evaluate the interaction of biotic variables, and less often biotic and abiotic variables. Although simulated pond communities offer unusually attractive properties for evaluating the effects of xenobiotics on aquatic ecosystems, this approach has received only limited attention as a potential model system for studying the effects of toxicants on amphibian communities. We provide a summary of results and experimental designs from past studies in order to illustrate the general protocols used and complex interactions between biotic and abiotic variables that can be simulated in artificial pond communities. We recommend that community ecologists who make use of this system generally become more aware of the importance of abiotic factors in pond simulations, and that they model the abiotic parameters of the particular system that they are attempting to simulate. We strongly recommend the use of this experimentally tractable system for aquatic community ecotoxicological research, since it is through such a multispecies, top-down simulation approach that we can begin to understand the processes by which xenobiotic factors impact more complex natural systems.

However, a review of empirical studies illustrates the limitations of the Levins definition and indicates the need for a more complex view of metapopulation dynamics. We describe a modeling approach that can incorporate a greater range of ecological and genetic processes within local populations.

There was a tendency toward increased settlement of hard clam larvae with increasing density of gem clams. Microscopic examination showed that increased settlement did not result from trapping or entanglement in sticky secretions from gem clams. Enhanced settlement in the presence of gem clams was persistent in both gently aerated and recirculated waters, and in both sand and muddy sand, suggesting that M mercenaria larvae could recognize settlement cues associated with G. gemma in various habitats and hydrodynamic conditions. Preferential settlement in sediment previously exposed to gem clams indicates that gem clams alter sediment in some way to make it attractive for larval settlement. In addition, increased settlement in the presence of empty gem clam shells in sediment suggests that settlement cues are properties of the shell, although the nearly significant settlement with gravel particles suggests that physical cues, such as grain size and bottom roughness, may play a role. Thus, this study demonstrates dense assemblages of small suspension feeders can enhance larval settlement of another bivalve species.","SUNY, MARINE SCI RES CTR, STONY BROOK, NY 11794 USA; KOREA OCEAN RES & DEV INST, POLAR RES CTR, SEOUL 425600, SOUTH KOREA; OREGON STATE UNIV, OREGON SEA GRANT INST, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA",,,,,,,,51,10,10,0,1,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

In a greenhouse experiment, thrips reduced root biomass of seedlings, but not shoot biomass. No correlation was found between density of thrips and change in aboveground area of plants after monitoring for 3 yr in the field. Thrips fed on the phyllaries and corollas of flower heads, as well as on leaves, and were particularly damaging to ray petals. Placed in artificial arrays, flower heads with rays damaged by thrips were less likely to be visited by pollinators than were undamaged flower heads. Plants in a common garden were subjected to three seasons of feeding by either spittle-bugs, plume moth caterpillars, both, or neither. Survival, growth, and flower production were measured for those 3 yr and for an additional 3 yr following the herbivory treatments. Plant survival was unaffected by these insect herbivores, although gophers (Thomomys bottae) were a major source of mortality. Plants with caterpillars produced more rosettes than those without moths. By consuming apical buds the caterpillars released axillary buds, thereby causing plants to produce more side rosettes. This difference in architecture did not result in an increase in flower production. Plants that had experienced 3 yr of spittle-bug or caterpillar attack produced fewer flower heads than controls during their 3rd yr. One year later, and after the herbivory treatments were discontinued, plants that had been damaged by spittlebugs (but not plume moth caterpillars) still produced fewer flowers than those in other treatments. Thereafter, no long-term effects of herbivory could be detected. All three herbivores were found to adversely affect some components of plant growth and reproduction. Because they are consistently abundant at Bodega Bay, these herbivores may reduce the fitness of their host plant.",,"KARBAN, R (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT ENTOMOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,"Strauss, Sharon/J-1827-2012","Strauss, Sharon/0000-0002-6117-4085",,,,26,143,147,4,44,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1993,74,1,,,,,39,46,,10.2307/1939499,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KF775,WOS:A1993KF77500005,,,,,2021-09-21,

Such assemblages may be organized at the level of guilds rather than at the finer species level. In a ten-year study of assemblages of fish at One Tree Reef, Great Barrier Reef, we found species composition and the number of fish on a given lagoonal patch reef vary greatly across time (Sale and Douglas 1984; Sale et al. in preparation). The mean average proportional similarity of a reef's assemblage to itself at different times (censuses) is usually low at a value of around 0.5. This apparent variability may be ecologically irrelevant noise if organization is at the higher guild level. We have recast our database at the guild level to test this possibility. Thirteen guilds were defined by the diets, foraging habitats and times of the individual species comprising them. Similarity of an assemblage to itself at successive censuses was re-calculated using the number of individuals in each guild instead of the numbers in each species. This analysis yielded significantly higher levels of similarity (P<0.01) among censuses. To test whether this increase in similarity was due solely to the smaller number of categories used to calculate the similarity indices, 5 sets of randomly generated guilds were constructed using a Monte Carlo approach. No significant difference (P>0.05) was found between the average similarity among censuses when assemblages were classified into these null guilds and when they were classified according to the real guilds. These results indicate that shifting to the larger taxonomic scale of guilds does not reveal a significantly more persistent assemblage structure than that revealed when analysis is at the smaller scale of species. There is no evidence of an underlying organization of these assemblages at the guild level.","UNIV NEW HAMPSHIRE, CTR MARINE BIOL, DURHAM, NH 03824 USA","SALE, PF (corresponding author), UNIV NEW HAMPSHIRE, DEPT ZOOL, DURHAM, NH 03824 USA.",,"Sale, Peter/AAM-5414-2020",,,,,55,23,23,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0722-4028,1432-0975,,CORAL REEFS,Coral Reefs,SEP,1992,11,3,,,,,147,154,,10.1007/BF00255469,,,8,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,JR082,WOS:A1992JR08200007,,,,,2021-09-21,

Hermit crabs are attracted specifically and in a manner similar to previously reported crab responses to odors from dead gastropods. Responses by C. vittatus to both kinds of odor are of three types: (1) aggregation/shell investigation responses (previously reported for odors from dead gastropods), characterized by increased locomotor activity, investigation of shells in the vicinity, and switching into empty shells; (2) alarm responses, in which crabs flee the area; and (3) withdrawal responses, in which crabs pull into their shells and do not come out. Studies with C. vittatus showed that the stimulatory chemicals originate from hemolymph, are less than 500 D, adsorb to octadecyl silica, and are recovered by elution with 20% methanol. Responses of C. vittatus are dependent upon crab size, type of shell occupied, and shell fit. Chemicals originating from dead conspecifics provide a forum for shell acquisition by crabs in relatively small shells and alarm by crabs in relatively large shells.","DUKE UNIV,MARINE LAB,BEAUFORT,NC 28516","RITTSCHOF, D (corresponding author), DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,BEAUFORT,NC 28516, USA.",,,,,,,52,76,77,0,18,PLENUM PUBL CORP,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013",0098-0331,,,J CHEM ECOL,J.
