Although the number of species of Dallia is debated, disjunct populations and distinct mitochondrial divisions that predate the end of the last glacial maximum are apparent. We developed sixteen polymorphic microsatellites from the Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis) to study genetic diversity in Dallia. Genotypes from two populations, Denali (n = 31) and Bethel (n = 35), demonstrated the usefulness of the loci for population-level investigation. Observed and expected heterozygosity averaged 18.6 and 19.8 % in Denali and 61.1 and 63.7 % in Bethel. Number of alleles at each locus averaged 3.50 in Denali and 9.63 in Bethel. The observed signature of variability and structuring between populations is consistent with mitochondrial data.","[Campbell, Matthew A.; DeWilde, Rachel L.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Sage, George K.; Talbot, Sandra L.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Lopez, J.

A comparison of foliage patrolling and herbivory in sites with invasive yellow crazy ants and native weaver ants,OIKOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ANOPLOLEPIS-GRACILIPES; EXTRAFLORAL NECTARIES; NORTHERN-TERRITORY; TROPICAL SAVANNAS; BIRD-ISLAND; PROTECTION; HYMENOPTERA; COMPETITION; INSECTS; IMPACT,"Benefits arising from facultative mutualisms between ants and plants vary with the identity of the ant partner. Invasive and native ants are both attracted to plants that offer extrafloral nectar, but few studies have compared their abilities to displace herbivores and benefit plants. Yellow crazy ants Anoplolepis gracilipes have invaded eucalypt woodlands of Arnhem Land, northern Australia, where they displace the native dominant weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina. We compared the plant defense services provided by A. gracilipes and O. smaragdina ants on trees with (Acacia lamprocarpa) and without (Eucalyptus tetrodonta) extrafloral nectar rewards through surrogate herbivore (termite) addition experiments and surveys of herbivore damage. Anoplolepis gracilipes were more likely than O. smaragdina to discover termites on A. lamprocarpa, but the likelihood of termite discovery on E. tetrodonta did not vary with ant species. Anoplolepis gracilipes were also more thorough in their attacks of termites, recruited 3.4-4 times more workers to termites, and were 3.4 times quicker at discovering termites on A. lamprocarpa than were O. smaragdina. Discovery of termites by other predators did not vary significantly between trees in A. gracilipes and O. smaragdina sites. Herbivory scores did not reflect the foliage patrolling pattern by the ants. Old A. lamprocarpa leaves and both new and old leaves and branches on E. tetrodonta in A. gracilipes sites had higher chewing herbivory scores than their counterparts in O. smaragdina sites. Our results reveal that the more aggressive and efficient foliar patrolling by A. gracilipes does not translate to increased plant protection. Ant invasions can disrupt native ant-plant mutualisms despite invasive ants possessing many traits associated with effective plant guarding.","[Lach, Lori] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Hoffmann, Benjamin D.] CSIRO Sustainable Ecosyst, Trop Ecosyst Res Ctr, Darwin, NT 0822, Australia","Lach, L (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, M090,35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",lori.lach@uwa.edu.au,"Hoffmann, Ben D/A-2746-2011; Lach, Lori/B-3145-2011","Hoffmann, Ben D/0000-0002-4010-4723; Lach, Lori/0000-0001-5137-5185",Australian National Heritage Trust; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"We thank the traditional landowners of northeast Arnhem land for access to field sites, and John Edgar, Daryl Lacey and Arian Pearson for field assistance.

(2) Within-group contest competition (aggressive interactions related to social-dominance rank) also did not strongly affect patch use. (3) The number of co-feeders in the same patch consistently showed positive effects on patch use, while food quality did not have consistent effects.

We investigated the effect of large predators on developing subtidal invertebrate communities in cobble-?lled collectors in the southwest Bay of Fundy, Canada. Two predation treatments (exclusion of predators >= 7 mm body width or full access for predators < 50 mm) were used to test the effect of large predators, and a partial-cage control tested for caging artefacts. Despite a reduction in the abundance and biomass of large predators, multivariate analyses indicated no effect of predator exclusion on the composition of the prey and micropredator communities. Results indicated that the largest differences were between the predator-access treatment and the other two treatments, which was potentially influenced by the caging material. There were signi?cant but weak positive correlations between the micropredator and the other two communities. Previous studies indicate that at low predation intensity, as seemed to be the case here, other factors may play a stronger role in controlling recruit abundance. Predation control probably varies spatially and temporally, and the influence of large predators was not likely the driving force for early post-settlement mortality in the invertebrate communities measured in this study.","[O'Malley, Betsy L.; Hunt, Heather L.] Univ New Brunswick St John, Dept Biol, St John, NB, Canada","O'Malley, BL (corresponding author), INRAE, Aquat Ecosyst & Global Changes Res Unit, 50 Ave Verdun, F-33612 Cestas, France.",betsy.barber@maine.edu,,"Hunt, Heather/0000-0002-5500-5015",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [364903-08],This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada under a Strategic Project Grant [number 364903-08] to Remy Rochette and Heather Hunt.,,93,0,0,2,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",1745-1000,1745-1019,,MAR BIOL RES,Mar.

Recent studies also show that ecological interactions between heterogeneous tumour cell populations can lead to resistance in chemotherapy. Here, we evaluated whether interactions between heterogenous populations could impact growth and response to radiotherapy in prostate cancer. Using mixed 3D cultures of parental and radioresistant populations from two prostate cancer cell lines and a predator-prey mathematical model to investigate various types of ecological interactions, we show that reciprocal interactions between heterogeneous populations enhance overall growth and reduce radiation sensitivity. The type of interaction influences the time of regrowth after radiation, and, at the population level, alters the survival and cell cycle of each population without eliminating either one. These interactions can arise from oxygen constraints and from cellular cross-talk that alter the tumour microenvironment. These findings suggest that ecological-type interactions are important in radiation response and could be targeted to reduce local recurrence. Using co-culture experiments and mathematical modelling, Paczkowski et al discover that prostate cancer spheroids comprising mixed tumour cell populations display enhanced growth and reduced radiation sensitivity due to competitive and antagonistic interactions between cell populations. This interdisciplinary approach reveals a role for ecological-type interactions in the radiation response and may be used to study other cancer types.","[Paczkowski, Marcin; Byrne, Helen M.] Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford, England; [Kretzschmar, Warren W.] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Sci Life Lab, Dept Gene Technol, Sch Engn Sci Chem Biotechnol & Hlth, Stockholm, Sweden; [Kretzschmar, Warren W.] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med Huddinge, Ctr Hematol & Regenerat Med HERM, Stockholm, Sweden; [Markelc, Bostjan; Harris, Adrian L.; Partridge, Mike; Kannan, Pavitra] Univ Oxford, CRUK & MRC Oxford Inst Radiat Oncol, Oxford, England; [Liu, Stanley K.] Univ Toronto, Sunnybrook Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Liu, Stanley K.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Liu, Stanley K.] Univ Toronto, Dept Radiat Oncol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kunz-Schughart, Leoni A.] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Med, OncoRay Natl Ctr Radiat Res Oncol, Dresden, Rossendorf, Germany; [Kunz-Schughart, Leoni A.] Tech Univ Dresden, Univ Hosp Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Rossendorf, Germany; [Kunz-Schughart, Leoni A.] Helmholtz Zentrum, Dresden, Rossendorf, Germany; [Kunz-Schughart, Leoni A.] Natl Ctr Tumor Dis NCT, Partner Site, Dresden, Germany; [Harris, Adrian L.] Univ Oxford, Weatherall Inst Mol Med, Oxford, England; [Kannan, Pavitra] Karolinska Inst, Dept Microbiol Tumor & Cell Biol, Stockholm, Sweden","Byrne, HM (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Math Inst, Oxford, England.; Kannan, P (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, CRUK & MRC Oxford Inst Radiat Oncol, Oxford, England.; Kannan, P (corresponding author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Microbiol Tumor & Cell Biol, Stockholm, Sweden.",helen.byrne@maths.ox.ac.uk; pk@sciencesylt.com,,"Byrne, Helen/0000-0003-1771-5910; Harris, Adrian/0000-0003-1376-8409; Kunz-Schughart, Leoni/0000-0003-3912-6594; Liu, Stanley/0000-0001-6851-0857","Cancer Research UKCancer Research UK; Engineering Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [C5255/A12678, C2522/A10339, C53469/A19834, C56606/A21440]; CRUK/EPSRC Oxford Cancer Imaging CentreUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Breast Cancer Now [2015MayPR479]; KTH Royal Institute of Technology; EPSRC at the Systems Biology programme of the University of Oxford's Doctoral Training CentreUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)","We thank Dr. David Robert Grimes for helpful discussions, Dr. Yunhong Cao for technical assistance, and Dr. Graham Brown and Dr. Rhodri Wilson for assistance with microscopy (Microscopy Core Facility, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford).

Substantial evidence indicates that direct genetic interactions or interbreeding between wild and escaped farmed Atlantic salmon occurs, genetically altering wild salmon and reducing population viability. However, genetic interactions may also occur through ecological mechanisms (e.g. disease, parasites, predation, competition), both in conjunction with and in the absence of interbreeding. Here we examine existing evidence for ecological and nonreproductive genetic interactions between domestic Atlantic salmon and wild populations and the potential use of genetic and genomic tools to resolve these impacts. Our review identified examples of genetic changes resulting from ecological processes, predominately through pathogen or parasite transmission. In addition, many examples were identified where aquaculture activities have either altered the selective landscape experienced by wild populations or resulted in reductions in population abundance, both of which are consistent with the widespread occurrence of indirect genetic changes. We further identify opportunities for genetic or genomic methods to quantify these impacts, though careful experimental design and pre-impact comparisons are often needed to accurately attribute genetic change to aquaculture activities. Our review indicates that ecological and non-reproductive genetic interactions are important, and further study is urgently needed to support an integrated understanding of aquaculture-ecosystem interactions, their implications for ecosystem stability, and the development of potential mitigation and management strategies.","[Bradbury, I.

However, the interaction of food quality and feeding competition on foraging decisions is largely unknown. Here we examine the importance of food quality in a patch on the foraging decisions of wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda using a multidestination platform array. The overall nutritional composition of the vervet diet was assessed and found to be low in sodium and lipids, thus we conducted a series of experimental manipulations in which the array was varied in salt and oil content. Although vervets prioritized platforms containing key nutrients (i.e., sodium and lipids) overall, we found that solitary vervets prioritized nutrient-dense platforms more strongly than competing vervets. This finding was opposite to those in a similar experiment that manipulated food site quantity, suggesting that large, salient rewards may be worth competing over but slight differences in nutritional density may be only chosen when there are no potentially negative social consequences (i.e., aggression received). We also found that vervets chose platforms baited with oil-only, and oil combined with salt, but not salt-only, suggesting that energy was an important factor in food choice. Our findings demonstrate that when wild vervets detect differences in feeding patches that reflect nutritional composition, they factor these differences into their navigational and foraging decisions. In addition, our findings suggest that these nutritional differences may be considered alongside social variables, ultimately leading to the complex strategies we observed in this study.","[Kumpan, L.

We used a manipulative experiment, placing resource patches with a known amount of millet seed within areas with reduced (RIFA [-]) or ambient (RIFA [+]) numbers of fire ants. We measured giving up densities (the amount of food left within each patch) within the resource patches for 4 days to quantify the effects of fire ants on cotton rat foraging. We assessed the effects of fire ant treatment (RIFA), Day, and their interaction on cotton rat giving up densities. Giving up densities on RIFA [+] grids were nearly 2.2 times greater across all foraging days and ranged from 1.6 to 2.3 times greater from day 1 to day 4 than the RIFA [-] grids. From day 1 to day 4, mean giving up densities decreased significantly faster for the RIFA [-] than RIFA [+] treatments, 58% and 13%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that cotton rats perceive a risk of injury from fire ants, which is likely caused by interference competition, rather than direct predation. Envenomation from ants likely decrease the foraging efficiency of cotton rats resulting in more time spent foraging. Increased time spent foraging is likely stressful in terms of the opportunity for direct injury and encounters with other predators. These indirect effects may reduce an individual cotton rat's fitness and translate into lowered population abundances.","[Darracq, Andrea K.] Univ North Georgia, Dept Biol, 151 Sunset Blvd, Dahlonega, GA 30597 USA; [Conner, L.

Darwin''s notion that these plants must actively attract the insects they capture raises the possibility that spiders could benefit from proximity to prey hotspots created by the plants. Alternatively, carnivorous plants and spiders may deplete prey locally or (through insect redistribution) more widely, reducing each other''s gain rates from predation. Here, we formulate and analyze a model of this guild, parameterized for carnivorous sundews and lycosid spiders, under assumptions of random movement by insects and optimal foraging by predators. Optimal foraging here involves gain maximization via trap investment (optimal web sizes and sundew trichome densities) and an ideal free distribution of spiders between areas with and without sundews. We find no facilitation: spiders and sundews engage in intense exploitation competition. Insect attraction by plants modestly increases sundew gain rates but slightly decreases spider gain rates. In the absence of population size structure, optimal spider redistribution between areas with and without sundews yields web sizes that are identical for all spiders, regardless of proximity to sundews. Web-building spiders have higher gain rates than wandering spiders in this system at high insect densities, but wandering spiders have the advantage at low insect densities. Results are complex, indicating that predictions to be tested empirically must be based on careful quantitative assessment.","[Crowley, Philip H.; Krupa, James J.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Hopper, Kevin R.] Bluegrass Community & Tech Coll, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Hopper, KR (corresponding author), Bluegrass Community & Tech Coll, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",kevin.hopper@kctcs.edu,,,Kentucky Community and Technical College System for a sabbatical leave; Kentucky Science and Engineering Foundation; Kentucky's National Science Foundation,"We thank the Nature Conservancy and the Pulaski County Conservation Commission for protecting Hazeldell Meadow and for allowing us to study this last remnant of Highlands Rim Wet Barrens habitat in Kentucky.

Numbers of knots stopping in Delaware Bay declined in the 1990s concurrent with a decline in horseshoe crabs, leading to the hypothesis that reduced horseshoe crab egg abundance limited the red knot population. Management efforts, including a seasonal harvest moratorium in the Delaware Bay, have been instituted to restore crab populations to levels of sustainable use by multiple users, including migratory birds. Our objective was to evaluate the sufficiency of horseshoe crab eggs in Delaware Bay in May-June 2004 and 2005 for knots to refuel for their migratory flight to the Arctic breeding grounds. We examined egg counts to determine if there were fewer high egg-density sites later than earlier in the day and season, as migrating birds might deplete this resource. We studied foraging rates at red knot locations to determine if foraging probes increased with time of day and season as birds depleted surface eggs by pecking, then began probing for subsurface eggs. Finally, we experimentally tested whether red knots and their competitors depleted horseshoe crab eggs. Crab egg numbers at knot foraging sites did not decline throughout the day or season in 2004. In both years, we found no evidence that knots switched from pecking to probing with increases in time since sunrise or start of the stopover. Egg numbers were similar in exclosed and accessible plots on crab nesting depressions and in areas of open intertidal zone, but were significantly lower in accessible than in exclosed plots in the wrack line. Our results indicate that horseshoe crab eggs in Delaware Bay were sufficient to support the refueling of the present-day stopover population of red knots. If an increase in the availability of crab eggs to foraging birds does not result in an increase in knot numbers, managers must prioritize mitigation of limiting factors at other historically important spring stopovers and on the poorly understood breeding and wintering grounds in addition to the Delaware Bay.

Limpet body size increased with increasing tidal height. This increase in size with tidal height was correlated with exposure to wave splash and migratory behavior. In areas of high and intermediate wave splash, there was a significant positive correlation between increased limpet size and tidal height, while in sheltered conditions there was no significant gradient in body size. Transplant experiments suggested that the size gradient could be maintained by the upward migration of large limpets and downward migration of small limpets. In the area with little size gradient, there was no significant directional migration of transplanted limpets. Limpets initially exhibited a fixed migratory response when displaced both within an area and between areas differing in exposure. However, after an acclimation period of 5 days in a new exposure condition, the response of transplanted L. digitalis was indistinguishable from that of limpets native to that condition, The findings suggest that both fixed short-term and flexible long-term migratory behavior are in part responsible for the maintenance of body size gradients.","STANFORD UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,STANFORD,CA 94305",,,"Hobday, Alistair J./A-1460-2012","Hobday, Alistair J./0000-0002-3194-8326",,,,39,32,34,4,32,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

The dominant species responsible for bush encroachment in Africa belong to the mimosoid genera Senegalia and Vachellia, with previous research identifying Vachellia as the more aggressive invader. We asked whether these genera have evolved different traits to enable germination and establishment among competitively superior grasses. We hypothesised that these traits enable coexistence at local scales and underpin differences in invasiveness. We conducted a large greenhouse pot experiment to quantify functional trait differences between the two genera during seedling establishment both in the presence and absence of grasses. We also examined differences in seed morphology and tested whether co-occurrence of the two genera at the plot scale is greater than expected by chance. Our results showed that Vachellia grew faster and taller than Senegalia in the absence of competition from grasses. In the presence of grasses, however, Senegalia increased root tissue density while Vachellia did not. The seed coats of Vachellia species were thicker than those of Senegalia, and their seeds were spherical while those of Senegalia were discoid. The two genera coexist at a local (plot) scale. We speculated that the thicker seed coat and spherical seed shape of Vachellia reflect its primarily endozoochorous dispersal mode, while the thinner seed coat and more discoid seeds of Senegalia reflect its use of wind dispersal. Since animal dispersal is directed, promoting the movement of seed into sites frequented by animals, and in which competition from grasses and fire has been removed, animal dispersal may contribute to the greater invasiveness of Vachellia. Once established in such sites, coexistence at the local scale is facilitated by differences in root tissue density with low-density root tissue allowing for rapid resource acquisition and growth in Vachellia, and high-density root tissue enabling slower but more persistent growth in Senegalia. Where previous research has focussed on environmental filtering, competition, predation or facilitation as explanations of plot-scale phylogenetic overdispersion, our work suggests a potential role for regeneration niche in structuring local co-occurrence.

One underlying process is the Allee effect, i.e., the difficulty of individuals to survive and reproduce when rare, and the consequently low or negative population growth. Although observations showing a positive relation between initial population size and establishment probability suggest that the Allee effect could be widespread in biological invasions, experimental tests are scarce. Here, we used a biological control program against Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in the United States to manipulate initial population size of the introduced parasitoid Aphelinus asychis Walker (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) originating from France. For eight populations and three generations after introduction, we studied spatial distribution and spread, density, mate-finding, and population growth. Dispersal was lower in small populations during the first generation. Smaller initial population size nonetheless resulted in lower density during the three generations studied. The proportion of mated females and the population sex ratio were not affected by initial population size or population density. Net reproductive rate decreased with density within each generation, suggesting negative density-dependence. But for a given density, net reproductive rate was smaller in populations initiated with few individuals than in populations initiated with many individuals. Hence, our results demonstrate a demographic Allee effect. Mate-finding is excluded as an underlying mechanism, and other component Allee effects may have been overwhelmed by negative density-dependence in reproduction. Impact of generalist predators could provide one potential explanation for the relationship between initial population size and net reproductive rate. However, the continuing effect of initial population size on population growth suggests genetic processes may have been involved in the observed demographic Allee effect.","[Fauvergue, Xavier] UNSA Interact Biot & Sante Vegetale, CNRS, INRA, UMR 1301, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Hopper, Keith Roderick] USDA ARS, Beneficial Insect Introduct Res Unit, Newark, DE 19713 USA","Fauvergue, X (corresponding author), UNSA Interact Biot & Sante Vegetale, CNRS, INRA, UMR 1301, 400 Routes Chappes,BP 167, F-06903 Sophia Antipolis, France.",xavier.fauvergue@sophia.inra.fr; Keith.Hopper@ars.usda.gov,"fauvergue, xavier/B-9108-2012","fauvergue, xavier/0000-0002-3579-7721; Hopper, Keith/0000-0002-8197-2519",,,,57,36,37,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1438-3896,1438-390X,,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

For oak (Quercus) in the eastern United States, these interactions may contribute to oak regeneration failure. Numerous studies have examined the impact of individual factors (like seed predation) on the oak regeneration process, but less information is available on the relative and combined impacts of multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors on early oak life history. We developed an individual- based, spatially explicit model to Simulate Oak Early Life history (SOEL). The model connects acorn survival, acorn dispersal, germination, seedling growth, and seedling survival submodels based on empirical data with an existing gap model (JABOWA). Using SOEL, we assessed the sensitivity of several metrics of oak regeneration to different parameters associated with early oak life history. We also applied the model in three individual case studies to assess: (1) how variable acorn production interacts with timing of timber harvest; (2) the effect of shelterwood harvest-induced differences on seed predation; and (3) the consequences of interactions between drought, seedling growth and survival, and timber harvest. We found that oak regeneration metrics including percent emergence, seedling density, and sapling density were most sensitive to the amount of acorn production, acorn caching probability by scatterhoarders, and seedling growth rates. In the case studies, we found that timing harvest to follow large acorn crops can increase the density of oak regeneration in the short term following harvest, at least under some conditions. Following midstory removal, lower weevil infestation probability and lower post-dispersal acorn survival resulted in a modest decline in seedling density, but the decline did not persist to the sapling life stage class. Drought frequency had a powerful negative impact on both growth and survival for individual seedlings, which resulted in large reductions in both seedling and sapling density. The case studies presented here represent only a few examples of what could be accomplished within the SOEL modeling framework. Further studies could focus on different early life history parameters, or connect the parameter values to different predictor variables based on field data.","[Kellner, Kenneth F.; Swihart, Robert K.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Kellner, KF (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",kkellner@purdue.edu,,,"Indiana Division of Forestry, the Department of Forestry and Natural Resources at Purdue University; Purdue University Graduate School; McIntire-Stennis Forestry Program","Funding for the project was provided by the Indiana Division of Forestry, the Department of Forestry and Natural Resources at Purdue University, the Purdue University Graduate School, and the McIntire-Stennis Forestry Program.

Knowledge of factors that improve our ability to detect predation events using animal telemetry data could be used to develop strategies to reduce time and resources required to obtain reliable kill estimates. Using Global Positioning System telemetry-collars, we investigated 246 bobcat Lynx rufus location clusters to identify white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus kill sites in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA, during May-August, 2009-2011. We documented kills of white-tailed deer at 42 location clusters. We used logistic regression and Akaike Information Criterion for small samples to identify factors (i.e. number of locations in cluster, time from cluster formation to investigation, time of day and land cover) that may influence bobcat behaviour and our ability to detect white-tailed deer kill sites. Clusters with more locations and the search of clusters within 14 days after cluster formation increased odds of detecting bobcat kill sites. The best-performing model was 67% accurate overall and identified 34% of kill sites and 75% of non-kill sites. Applying our best-performing model with the optimal cut-off value would result in a twofold increase in the identification of white-tailed deer kill sites reducing time and effort to find a similar number of kill sites without models by half. Identifying factors that improve our ability to identify bobcat kill sites can reduce field effort and search time.","[Svoboda, Nathan J.; Belant, Jerrold L.; Duquette, Jared F.; Martin, James A.] Mississippi State Univ, Carnivore Ecol Lab, Forest & Wildlife Res Ctr, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Beyer, Dean E.] Michigan Dept Nat Resources, Wildlife Div, Marquette, MI 49855 USA","Svoboda, NJ (corresponding author), Mississippi State Univ, Carnivore Ecol Lab, Forest & Wildlife Res Ctr, Box 9690, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",nsvoboda@cfr.msstate.edu; jbelant@cfr.msstate.edu; dbeyer@nmu.edu; jduquette@cfr.msstate.edu; jmartin@cfr.msstate.edu,,,Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act under Pittman-Robertson project [W-147-R]; Michigan Department of Natural Resources; Mississippi State University's Forest; Wildlife Research Center; Safari Club International Foundation; Michigan Involvement Committee of Safari Club International,"this project was supported by the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act under Pittman-Robertson project W-147-R.

Natural enemies (e.g., predators, parasites, and herbivores) are ubiquitous in food webs and are predicted to have significant impacts on phenotypic diversity and on speciation, and extinction rates of their prey. Spurred by the development of a theoretical framework beginning in the late 1970s, there is now a growing body of literature that addresses the effects of enemy-prey interactions on the evolution of prey. A number of theoretical models predict that enemies can produce phenotypic divergence between closely related species, even in the absence of interspecific competition for resources. Effects on diversification of prey are more variable, and enemies may either enhance or depress speciation and extinction rates of their prey. Empirical evidences from a number of study systems, notably those involving predators and prey in aquatic environments and interactions between insects and flowering plants, confirm both predictions. There is now considerable evidence for the role of enemies, especially those that are size-selective or use visual cues when identifying suitable prey, on phenotypic divergence of sympatric and allopatric taxa. Enemies may spur diversification rates in certain groups under some circumstances, and hinder diversification rates in other cases. I suggest that further research should focus on the role of enemies in diversification of prey, with significant insights likely to be the product of applying traditional experimental approaches and emerging comparative phylogenetic methods.","Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Vamosi, SM (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",smvamosi@ucalgary.ca,"Vamosi, Steven/C-8126-2009","Vamosi, Steven/0000-0003-3903-5000",,,,175,107,111,0,69,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0008-4301,1480-3283,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

In many species, embryos obtain nutrition during ontogeny by ingesting substances contained in the intracapsular fluid. South American volutids spawn egg capsules containing relatively few eggs, and development is entirely intracapsular, with young hatching as crawl-away juveniles. The spawning habits, egg capsules morphology and embryonic development of the South American volutid Adelomelon ancilla is described in this work. Egg capsules of A. ancilla (n = 42) contained 3.0 +/- 1.4 (mean +/- SD) embryos with a range of 1-6 eggs or embryos. The embryonic morphological changes and body spiralization occur simultaneously with embryo feeding. All embryos within a single egg capsule shared the same developmental stage. No evidence of cannibalism or intracapsular competition was found, suggesting that food is not a limiting resource as in other volutid species. Estimated intracapsular developmental time varied between five and six months (between 12-14 degrees C). The long developmental time and low number of embryos inside the egg capsules, together with late reproductive maturity and longevity of adult individuals, reinforce the statement that the neogastropod Adelomelon ancilla is a fragile resource that must be conserved in Argentinean benthic communities.","[Zabala, Soledad; Averbuj, Andres; Bigatti, Gregorio] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CENPAT, LARBIM, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina; [Sanchez Antelo, Carlos; Penchaszadeh, Pablo E.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Museo Argentino Ciencias Nat Bernardino Rivadavia, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Bigatti, Gregorio] Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Puerto Madryn, Argentina","Zabala, S (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CENPAT, LARBIM, Bvd Brown 2915,U9120ACD, Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina.",zabala@cenpat.edu.ar,,"Averbuj, Andres/0000-0003-2416-2007; Penchaszadeh, Pablo E/0000-0002-2043-8814; BIGATTI, GREGORIO/0000-0001-7053-6802","CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); PICTANPCyT [2929, 1232, 1476]","We would like to thank Oscar Wheeler and Eugenia Zavattieri for field assistance; Jaime Groizard for technical support in SEM pictures (ALUAR S.A.).

However, it is not clear whether pseudodiaptomids (e.g., Schmackeria), one of the dominant calanoid copepods in Chinese lakes, effectively impacts natural ciliate communities. The impacts of small-bodied cladocerans (e.g., Bosmina) on ciliates are also controversial. We performed an incubation experiment using winter lake water from Lake Chaohu to assess the structuring effects that crustacean zooplankton have on natural ciliate populations. The presence and absence of cladocerans (Bosmina sp.) and copepods (Schmackeria inopinus) were alternated in four treatments. Both Bosmina sp. and Schmackeria inopinus had substantial impacts on ciliate abundance, biomass, and community structure. The response of ciliates was different in the presence of Bosmina sp. compared with Schmackeria inopinus and varied among categories such as the ciliate population, relative body size and functional feeding group. Our results also highlight the importance of interference and exploitative competition among metazooplankton groups.","[Li, Jing; Yang, Kun; Lu, Wenxuan; Fang, Ting; Zhao, Xiuxia; Li, Haiyang; Cui, Kai] Anhui Acad Agr Sci, Fisheries Res Inst, 40 South Nongke Rd, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Chen, Feizhou] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Cui, K (corresponding author), Anhui Acad Agr Sci, Fisheries Res Inst, 40 South Nongke Rd, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.",LJLJ278@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31400398]; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [1508085QC55]; Provincial Science and Technology Projects Program of Anhui [1604a0802111]; China Agriculture Research System [CARS-46],"Funding for this project was provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31400398), the Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province (No. 1508085QC55), the Provincial Science and Technology Projects Program of Anhui (No. 1604a0802111), and the China Agriculture Research System (CARS-46).

Canopy-foraging ants have carbohydrate-rich diets and the stoichiometric excess of carbon may result in energetic allocation decisions that facilitate ecological dominance. 2. If dietary carbohydrates facilitate ecological dominance in canopy ants, then the mechanism for this relationship is unknown. 3. Four hypotheses were posit that may explain how a carbohydrate-rich diet might facilitate ecological dominance in canopy ants: Aggressive Defense, Metabolic Fuel, Foraging Success, and Prey Acquisition. 4. To assess these hypotheses, experiments were conducted on the canopy-foraging bullet ant, Paraponera clavata (Fabricius), an omnivorous species that demonstrates high variability in the relative contribution of carbohydrates to the diets of colonies. 5. No support was found for the Aggressive Defense, Metabolic Fuel and Prey Acquisition hypotheses. 6. The Foraging Success hypothesis was supported, as the proportion of nectar in the diet predicted the overall foraging success. 7. It was argued that there is no explicit advantage in the exploitation of nectar over other food resources, other than the fact that it is the most accessible food resource in the rainforest canopy.","[McGlynn, Terrence P.; Parra, Erica L.] Calif State Univ Dominguez Hills, Dept Biol, 1000 E Victoria St, Carson, CA 90747 USA","McGlynn, TP (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Dominguez Hills, Dept Biol, 1000 E Victoria St, Carson, CA 90747 USA.",terry.mcglynn@gmail.com,"McGlynn, Terrence/ABD-3939-2020","McGlynn, Terrence/0000-0002-4290-6156","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OISE-1261015, HRD-1302873]; CSUDH Office of Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activity; Direct For Education and Human ResourcesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF- Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR) [1302873] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Office Of The DirectorNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [1130156] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (OISE-1261015; HRD-1302873) and the CSUDH Office of Undergraduate Research, Scholarship and Creative Activity.

We evaluated the size and species of prey consumed by adult female and juvenile northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and adults and chicks of black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), red-legged kittiwakes (Rissa brevirostris), thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), and common murres (Uria aalge) from data collected between July and October 1960-2000. Sample sources included stomachs from seals and seabirds collected on pelagic foraging grounds in the eastern Bering Sea, seal scats from rookeries and seabird regurgitations and whole prey from nest sites on St. Paul and St. George Islands of the Pribilof Island archipelago. Typical prey included small fish and invertebrates (<= 20 cm for seals and <= 12 cm for seabirds) that concentrate along frontal boundaries of the continental shelf/slope and in the epi-pelagic zone. Squids and fishes including walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), capelin (Mallotus villosus), and sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) were variably important in the diet of all five predators. Some prey, such as capelin, were principal in predator diets during the 1960s (seals) and into the early 1980s (seabirds), but declined or disappeared from all predator diets thereafter while others, such as walleye pollock, occurred with increasing frequency from the 1970s forward. As the number of individuals consuming walleye pollock increased, the overall volume of pollock in seabird diets declined. This decline was coincident with a decrease in the age and body size of pollock consumed by both seabirds and fur seals. Squid and pollock were negatively correlated in the diets of their primary consumers, northern fur seals (Pearson's coefficient -0.71, p = 0.016) and thick-billed murres (Pearson's coefficient = -0.74, p = 0.015) from the 1970s forward. Inter-island variation in diet was evident to varying degrees for all predators, with a prevalence of fish on St. Paul Island and invertebrates on St. George Island. Bayesian time-series analysis of synthesized data described significant temporal cross-correlation in diet among northern fur seals, red- and black-legged kittiwakes, and thick-billed murres. For all correlated predators except common murres, beta-binomial modeling indicated that trends in the occurrence of four of the five primary prey (sand lance, capelin, squid, and pollock) evaluated, were significantly associated with eastern Bering Sea time-series trends in sea surface temperature, ice retreat or a combination of both. Data synthesis highlighted potential competition and a scenario for the effects of an altered prey field on the population stability of predators. The association between correlated diet changes among predators and indices of oceanographic shifts in the 1970s and the 1990s allow scrutiny of hypotheses concerning causal mechanisms in population declines.

Indirect effects may diminish as they propagate through highly reticulate food webs. We tested this hypothesis by assembling replicate food webs of different complexity in laboratory microcosms, and comparing the transmission of indirect effects through these webs. By providing the top predator (Didinium) with either one (Paramecium) or two (Paramecium and Colpidium) species of protists as prey, we created linear or reticulate food webs where we could examine the transient response of predators to an indirect effect. Addition of Chlamydomonas, a small alga consumed by Paramecium, but not by Colpidium?, perturbed the system and generated an indirect effect on Didinium. We expected the proportional response of Didinium to Chlamydomonas addition would be smaller in the reticulate web containing alternative, unperturbed prey (Colpidium). We measured predator response as predator yield, the maximum number of predators produced prior to overexploitation of prey and subsequent predator decline. The ratio of yield in perturbed bottles to yield in unperturbed bottles measures the proportional response of Didinium to Chlamydomonas addition. We expected this ratio to be smaller with Colpidium present. Contrary to expectations, alternative prey enhanced rather than diminished predator response to the perturbation. This resulted from competition between the prey species, a factor ignored in some simple verbal arguments. Food web complexity may have unanticipated consequences for the strength of indirect effects.","Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Populat Biol, NERC, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, Cook Coll, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA","Fox, JW (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Populat Biol, NERC, Silwood Pk, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",jwfox@rci.rutgers.edu,,,,,,57,17,17,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2000,90,2,,,,,219,226,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.900202.x,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,349EX,WOS:000089031600002,,,,,2021-09-27,

The interactive effect of these multiple factors has never been analyzed statistically in a model approach. We used proportional hazards analysis to analyze the interactive effect of space (4 creeks) and time (diurnal neap tide cycles in 2 seasons) on patterns in the intertidal migration of 3 size classes of the banded puffer fish Colomesus psittacus (Tetraodontidae) from mangrove creeks and link this to ontogenetic and temporal changes in feeding. The intertidal migration strategy and patterns of vertical resource exploitation changed ontogenetically, thereby reducing intraspecific competition. Juvenile fish entered creeks earlier and left later, which resulted in longer feeding times and fuller intestines than adults. Juveniles fed mainly on barnacles and fiddler crabs from the mid-intertidal, while adults were specialized predators of the mangrove crab Ucides cordatus from the high intertidal. The shape of the migration curves (the proportions of fish leaving a creek at a given ebb tide water level) indicated that the tidal migration took place in close response to creek-specific drainage characteristics and suggests that the fish interact successfully with variable and dynamic creek features in a macrotidal mangrove environment. When ebb tide cycles were completed during daylight hours, the tidal migration was well-structured. When ebb tide overlapped with sunset, juveniles left earlier, and the tidal migration was compressed. We provide a time budget scenario of habitat use by diurnal C. psittacus during a 15 d spring-neap tide cycle according to the changes in interactions of flood and ebb tide with sunset and sunrise.","[Giarrizzo, Tommaso] Lab Biol Pesqueira Manejo Recursos Aquat UFPA, BR-66040170 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Krumme, Uwe] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Ecol ZMT, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Wosniok, Werner] Univ Bremen, Inst Stat, D-28359 Bremen, Germany","Giarrizzo, T (corresponding author), Lab Biol Pesqueira Manejo Recursos Aquat UFPA, Av Perimetral 2651, BR-66040170 Belem, Para, Brazil.",tgiarrizzo@gmail.com,"Giarrizzo, Tommaso/G-8482-2016","Giarrizzo, Tommaso/0000-0002-5116-5206",Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Para (FAPESPA)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [137/2008 - Universal]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF),"The authors thank A.

In males, song sharing between neighbours has been shown to facilitate territory defence, but little is known about the importance of song sharing for such behaviour in females. Here, I examined sex roles and song element sharing in two related species: the splendid fairy-wren, Malurus splendens, and the variegated fairy-wren, Malurus lamberti. I first described song structure and song element sharing between partners and neighbours in both male and female songs. I then simulated conspecific intrusions by broadcasting a female or a male song within a pair's territory. Both splendid and variegated fairy-wren females sang songs as complex as their male counterparts and responded to playback of simulated conspecific intrusions. Song element sharing with neighbours was common in both species, but only splendid fairy-wren females shared more elements with their mate than with other recorded males on average. Females in each species engaged in different strategies when responding to territory intruders: female splendid fairy-wrens competed with female intruders, while variegated fairy-wren females coordinated their defence with their mates and exhibited cooperative defence behaviours toward male intruders.

Recent developments in efficient computer-based video analyses have allowed testing pesticide effects on model species such as the zebrafish. However, these new techniques have not yet been applied to amphibians and directly to conservation issues. i.e., to assess toxicological risks on threatened species. We used video-tracking analyses to test a quantitative effect of an environmental contaminant on the locomotion of amphibian tadpoles (Rana temporaria) by taking into account cumulative effects. Because recent research has demonstrated effects of de-icing salts on survival and community structure, we used sodium chloride in our experimental design (25 replicates, 4 concentrations, 4 times) to test for an effect at the scale of behavior at environmentally relevant concentrations. Analysis of 372 1-h video-tracks (5 samples/s) showed a complex action of salts on behavioral patterns with a dose and cumulative response over time. Although no effects were found on mortality or growth, the highest salt concentrations reduced the speed and movement of tadpoles in comparison with control treatments. The reduced locomotor performance could have detrimental consequences in terms of tadpoles' responses to competition and predation and may be an indicator of the low concentration effect of the contaminant. On one hand, this study demonstrates the usefulness of examining behavior to address conservation issues and understand the complex action of environmental factors and, more particularly, pollutants on organisms. On the other hand, our results highlight the need of new computerized techniques to quantitatively analyze these patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Small individuals (<100 mm in total length) were significantly more likely to attack larvae than larger individuals. Differences were also found in attack rates between individuals. The rate ranged from no attacks to attacks towards every larva exposed to the cannibalistic individual. These results confirm that intercohort cannibalism is neither an exceptional nor a universal phenomenon when freely swimming Vendace larvae are exposed to older conspecifics.

In cavity-nesting vertebrate communities, where the availability of tree cavities can limit reproduction and the reuse of cavities can increase nest predation by squirrels, excavators may maximize their fecundity by creating new cavities in competitor- and predator-rich habitats that undergo food pulses. The reproductive cost associated with excavation (i.e. increased energy allocation early in the breeding season that often delays laying and thereby reduces clutch size), may be reduced if food pulses allow for a longer breeding season and larger clutches. A large-scale mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae outbreak that occurred during our long-term study (1995-2009) provided a natural food supplementation experiment across 27 sites in British Columbia, Canada. We examined the effects of a reduction in food constraints accompanied with increases in excavation rates, conspecific density and nest predation risk on the fecundity of a facultative excavator, the red-breasted nuthatch Sitta canadensis. We found a total of 420 nests in tree cavities. Nuthatch clutch sizes ranged from two to nine eggs, and broods from one to nine fledglings per nest. Later clutches were larger at sites and in years with high beetle abundance (mean clutch size of six eggs did not decline later in the season), second broods were produced in outbreak years (usually only one nesting attempt/normal year), and the number of fledglings per successful nest increased with increasing beetle abundance and nuthatch densities, but declined with increased squirrel densities. Since fecundity did not differ between new and reused cavities, the costs and benefits of excavation versus cavity reuse may be neutralized for nuthatches during strong resource pulses. Overall, the beetle outbreak reduced food constraints for nuthatches and provided alternate food for nest predators, allowing increased annual fecundity.","[Norris, Andrea R.; Martin, Kathy] Univ British Columbia, Ctr Appl Conservat Res, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Martin, Kathy] Environm Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Delta, BC V4K 3N2, Canada","Norris, AR (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Ctr Appl Conservat Res, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",andrea.norris@alumni.ubc.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Environment CanadaCGIAR; Space for Habitat project; Science Horizons Intern Program; Forest Renewal British Columbia; Tolko Limited; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Four Year Doctoral Fellowship; Pacific Century Graduate Scholarship from the Univ. of British Columbia; Forest Investment Account Forest Science Program (Graduate Student Pilot Project); Forest Investment Account Forest Science Program (Mountain Pine Beetle Initiative Graduate Research Fund); Southern Interior Bluebird Trail Society; Junco Technologies Award from the Society of Canadian Ornithologists and Bird Studies Canada,"We thank the numerous field assistants and students who collected data on the Nest Web project over the years, particularly D.

Environmentally induced shifts in growth and development in species with complex life cycles determine the timing of transitions between subsequent life stages, as well as body condition at transformation, which greatly determine survival at later stages. Here we show that spadefoot toad larvae surviving pond drying and predators experienced marked alterations in growth and development, and in their fat reserves, oxidative stress, and relative telomere length. Tadpoles accelerated development but reduced growth and consumed more fat reserves when facing pond drying. However, oxidative stress was buffered by increased antioxidant enzyme activity, and telomeres remained unchanged. Predators caused opposite effects: they reduced larval density, hence relaxing competition and allowing faster development and enhanced growth of survivors. Tadpoles surviving predators metamorphosed bigger and had larger fat bodies, increasing their short-term survival odds, but showed signs of oxidative stress and had shorter telomeres. Developmental acceleration and enhanced growth thus seemed to have different physiological consequences: reduced fat bodies and body size compromise short-term survival, but are reversible in the long run, whereas telomere shortening is non-reversible and could reduce long-term survival.","[Burraco, Pablo; Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan] CSIC, Donana Biol Stn, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, E-41092 Seville, Spain","Burraco, P; Gomez-Mestre, I (corresponding author), CSIC, Donana Biol Stn, Dept Wetland Ecol, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, E-41092 Seville, Spain.",burraco@ebd.csic.es; igmestre@ebd.csic.es,"Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/L-8931-2014; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan/F-8226-2014","Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen/0000-0002-6717-0173; Gomez-Mestre, Ivan/0000-0003-0094-8195","Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [CGL2012-40044, CGL2014-59206-P]; Ministerio de EducacionGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [AP2010-5373]","This study was funded by Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (grants CGL2012-40044 and CGL2014-59206-P).

The frequency distributions of prey captured by spiders are often compared among species or individuals to search for evidence of competition, effects of experimental manipulations, etc. In most instances, smaller insects are extremely common compared to larger prey, presenting a critical flaw in how such comparisons are analyzed because natural selection acts upon web evolution through the biomass, rather than total number, of prey captured. The rare, large prey hypothesis, developed for Zygiella x-notata (Clerk 1757), suggests that orb spiders derive the bulk of their energy not from common prey, but rather from a small subset of the largest possible insects. If correct, then orb webs should be designed to facilitate the capture of these insects, which are essential for spider fitness, even though they rarely fly into webs. Here, I test the generality of the rare, large prey hypothesis by comparing the frequency and biomass of large prey in 38 studies of the diets of 31 species of orb spiders in four different families. I define large prey as insects at least 66% as long as the spiders capturing them. The 38 studies included both large and small species of spiders, living in both tropical and temperate habitats. Large insects accounted for only 17% of the total number of prey captured by spiders, but contributed 85% of the total consumable biomass. The rare, large prey hypothesis thus can apparently be generalized across orb spiders. Future experiments need to account for the disproportionate influence of these large insects on spider fitness and on how to effectively measure these rare events. More importantly, the rare, large prey hypothesis provides a new framework in which to better understand variation in the web spinning behaviors of spiders.","[Blackledge, Todd A.] Univ Akron, Dept Biol, Akron, OH 44325 USA; [Blackledge, Todd A.] Univ Akron, Integrated Biosci Program, Akron, OH 44325 USA","Blackledge, TA (corresponding author), Univ Akron, Dept Biol, Akron, OH 44325 USA.",blackledge@uakron.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-0745379],"I thank Ingi Agnarsson, Jonathan Coddington and Andrew Sensenig for insightful discussions about this topic.

These ground-nesting bees defend their developing offspring against pathogens and predators, and thus exhibit some of the key traits that preceded insect sociality. Alkali bees are also efficient native pollinators of alfalfa seed, which is a crop of major economic value in the United States. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated a high-quality draft genome of 299.6 Mbp for this species. Repetitive content makes up more than one-third of this genome, and previously uncharacterized transposable elements are the most abundant type of repetitive DNA. We predicted 10,847 protein coding genes, and identify 479 of these undergoing positive directional selection with the use of population genetic analysis based on low-coverage whole genome sequencing of 19 individuals. We found evidence of recent population bottlenecks, but no significant evidence of population structure. We also identify 45 genes enriched for protein translation and folding, transcriptional regulation, and triglyceride metabolism evolving slower in alkali bees compared to other halictid bees.

Below 15 m, it co-occurs with the mytilid Aulacomya atra and it dominates the benthic community below 20 m. To determine the question of why M. venosa is a successful competitor, the in situ growth rate of the brachiopod was studied and its overall growth performance compared with that of other brachiopods and mussels. The growth in length was measured between February 2011 and March 2012 after mechanical tagging and calcein staining. Settlement and juvenile growth were determined from recruitment tiles installed in 2009 and from subsequent photocensus. Growth of M. venosa is best described by the general von Bertalanffy growth function, with a maximum shell length (L-infinity) of 71.53 mm and a Brody growth constant (K) of 0.336 year(-1). The overall growth performance (OGP index = 5.1) is the highest recorded for a rynchonelliform brachiopod and in the range of that for Mytilus chilensis (4.8-5.27), but lower than that of A. atra (5.74). The maximal individual production (P-Ind) is 0.29 g AFDM ind(-1) year(-1) at 42 mm shell length and annual production ranges from 1.28 to 89.25 g AFDM year(-1) m(-2) (1-57% of that of A. atra in the respective fjords). The high shell growth rate of M. venosa, together with its high overall growth performance may explain the locally high population density of this brachiopod in Comau Fjord. However, the production per biomass of the population (P/(B) over bar -ratio) is low (0.535) and M. venosa may play only a minor role in the food chain. Settling dynamics indicates that M. venosa is a pioneer species with low juvenile mortality. The coexistence of the brachiopod and bivalve suggests that brachiopod survival is affected by neither the presence of potential brachiopod predators nor that of space competitors (i.e. mytilids).","[Baumgarten, Sebastian; Laudien, Juergen; Jantzen, Carin] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Baumgarten, Sebastian] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Haeussermann, Verena; Foersterra, Guenter] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Fac Recursos Nat, Escuela Ciencias Mar, Valparaiso, Chile; [Haeussermann, Verena; Foersterra, Guenter] Huinay Sci Field Stn, Huinay, Chile","Laudien, J (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Alten Hafen 26, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany.",juergen.laudien@awi.de,,"Laudien, Jurgen/0000-0003-2663-4821; Baumgarten, Sebastian/0000-0003-2646-7699",,,,73,17,17,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0173-9565,1439-0485,,MAR ECOL-EVOL PERSP,Mar.

Experiments were conducted in two pairs of 2-ha field enclosures. Risk of predation was introduced to one I-ha subplot of each pair of enclosures either by simulating the light of a full moon or by causing trained owls to fly over our experimental subplot. We used a titration method to estimate the energetic costs associated with risk of predation. We added seeds to the 1-ha subplot of each enclosure that experienced the risk of predation. The adjacent subplot served as a control. Without seed addition the subplot without risk of predation had more foraging activity: the foragers were avoiding the risk of predation. As the amount of seeds in the treatment increased, the gerbils responded smoothly and quantitatively and shifted their foraging activity back to the subplot with the seeds (and risk). At addition rates of 4.24-8.47 seeds per individual per ha per night (simulated-moonlight treatment) and 4.24-5.64 g seeds per individual per ha per night (owl-flights treatment) the seed addition compensated for the extra risk. At these rates the foraging activity on the two subplots of each enclosure was the same. Our results suggested that, when challenged by the threat of predation, G. allenbyi individuals spent at least 25% of their foraging time being vigilant.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Abramsky, Z (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",,"ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012",,,,,56,72,73,1,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,MAY,2002,83,5,,,,,1330,1340,,10.2307/3071947,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,543YK,WOS:000175131300016,,,,,2021-09-27,

Sex ratio could influence ecological conditions whenever sexual dimorphism is associated with ecological dimorphism in species with strong ecological interactions. We tested for ecological implications of sex ratio variation in the sexually dimorphic western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis. This species causes strong pelagic trophic cascades and exhibits substantial variation in adult sex ratios. We found that female-biased populations induced stronger pelagic trophic cascades compared with male-biased populations, causing larger changes to key community and ecosystem responses, including zooplankton abundance, phytoplankton abundance, productivity, pH and temperature. The magnitude of such effects indicates that sex ratio is important for mediating the ecological role of mosquitofish. Because both sex ratio variation and sexual dimorphism are common features of natural populations, our findings should encourage broader consideration of the ecological significance of sex ratio variation in nature, including the relative contributions of various sexually dimorphic traits to these effects.","[Fryxell, David C.; Apgar, Travis M.; Palkovacs, Eric P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Arnett, Heather A.; Kinnison, Michael T.] Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, Orono, ME 04469 USA","Fryxell, DC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",dfryxell@ucsc.edu,"Fryxell, David/AAP-2545-2020","Fryxell, David/0000-0003-4543-4809; Apgar, Travis/0000-0002-5205-2350","National Science Foundation (NSF-DEB)National Science Foundation (NSF) [1457333, 1457112]; UC Santa Cruz; Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station [3442]; NSF EAPSI FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1316649]; NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1457112] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1457333] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF-DEB # 1457333, NSF-DEB # 1457112), UC Santa Cruz, and the Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station (# 3442).

Size structure has often been used to infer patterns of resource abundance and predation. However, food availability and predation risk in contrasting habitats have proven difficult to measure in the field. We use an inverse modeling approach to estimate food availability and habitat choice parameters from changes in length distributions of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). The model suggests that dynamics of bluegill length distributions primarily reflect food availability and habitat choice. Bluegill behavior minimized effects of size-selective predation on size structure. Parameters for food availability and habitat choice were correlated. It was therefore not possible to attain unique estimates of food availability and habitat selection when both were free parameters. However, when one parameter was estimated independently, the other could be identified. In five Wisconsin lakes, seining studies were used to estimate the size at which bluegill switched from littoral to pelagic habitats. Using this measure of switch size in the model, we estimated food availability for bluegill in each lake. These estimates were positively correlated with observed growth (r(2) = 0.91), demonstrating the model's ability to estimate food availability.","Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Limnol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Nibbelink, NP (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool, POB 3166, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",nathan@uwyo.edu,"Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020",,,,,37,8,9,2,11,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Studies suggest that brood parasitism does not occur at random, but that parasitic females select nests with advantages such as higher physical stability, reduced predation risk, or lower ectoparasite infestations. However, this evidence is sparse and mainly correlative. By experimentally increasing the abundance of Carnus hemapterus (a common, generalist and widespread ectoparasitic nest fly of a multitude of bird species) in half of the nests, we show that parasitic Spotless Starlings (Sturnus unicolor) avoid conspecific nests infested by ectoparasites. Since Carnus ectoparasites impinge costs on their avian nestling hosts, this avoidance response would be adaptive for parasitic Starlings. Further, we suggest a mechanism by which parasitic females may assess the level of ectoparasite infestation to select host nests accordingly: by using parasite cues such as faeces and blood remains. Additionally, these cues may be used by parasitic females for synchronization with the reproductive cycle of host females because ectoparasite cues also indicate that incubation has already commenced. Whatever the functionality, the mechanism suggested here may be employed by intra- and interspecific brood parasites, so it might represent a widespread strategy in nature.","[Tomas, Gustavo; Martin-Galvez, David; Ruiz-Rodriguez, Magdalena; Soler, Juan J.] CSIC, EEZA, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, Ctra Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain; [Tomas, Gustavo] UTPL, Dept Ciencias Nat, Calle Paris S-N, Loja 1101608, Ecuador; [Martin-Galvez, David] European Bioinformat Inst, European Mol Biol Lab, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England","Tomas, G (corresponding author), CSIC, EEZA, Dept Ecol Func & Evolut, Ctra Sacramento S-N, Almeria 04120, Spain.; Tomas, G (corresponding author), UTPL, Dept Ciencias Nat, Calle Paris S-N, Loja 1101608, Ecuador.",gtomas@eeza.csic.es,"Martin-Galvez, David/H-3707-2011; Soler, J.

Although numerous studies have documented negative impacts of native consumers on exotic plant performance, longer-term multi-generation studies are needed to understand how native consumer damage to exotics translates to their population-level suppression over large landscapes. We used rodent exclosures and embedded seed-addition experiments to evaluate the effects of rodent herbivory and granivory on populations of Tragopogon dubius, a Eurasian aster that typically occurs at low abundance across North America. Vegetation surveys encompassing 20 000 km2 of west-central Montana grasslands established that T. dubius is regionally well distributed, occurring in 81% of 16 grasslands sampled. However, it consistently occurred at low local abundance, averaging < 0.5% cover in 1 m2 plots. In large rodent exclosures, T. dubius attained population densities that averaged over five times higher than in paired rodent-access control plots at 11 grassland sites spread over 750 km2. This pattern was six times stronger in older compared with newer rodent exclosures, indicating enclosed populations were still increasing. Floral herbivory, which reduces or prevents reproduction in this biennial plant, decreased by 99% in rodent exclosures compared with control plots. Additionally, seedling establishment was nearly eight times higher in seed-addition subplots within versus outside of rodent exclosures. Synthesis. Our findings illustrate how biotic resistance from granivory and florivory of native generalist rodents can provide an important ecosystem service by strongly limiting the local abundance of a widely distributed exotic weed.","[Pearson, Dean E.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Pearson, Dean E.; Potter, Teal; Maron, John L.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA","Pearson, DE (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Missoula, MT 59801 USA.",dpearson@fs.fed.us,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0915409]; USDA CSREESUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2005-35101-16040]; Rocky Mountain Research Station Competitive Research Initiative grant; President's Early Career Award in Science and Engineering,"We thank J.

Typically, maximal performance is quantified using two alternative methods: across distance intervals or across time intervals, the later by extracting the speed observed between a specified number of video frames. Here, we analyze how this choice may influence statistical inference and the derived biological interpretations. Our results indicate that data obtained using 10-cm intervals are categorized, not normally distributed, exhibit lower individual repeatabilities and have four times more variance compared to the data obtained by quantifying speeds across short time intervals. These results have important methodological implications, as they suggest that the choice of method of speed quantification substantially influences the quality and bias of maximal performance descriptors. This may in turn have a profound influence on ecomorphological inference, as it affects our capacity of detecting variation in performance within and across groups, and associations between locomotor performance and other traits.","[Gomes, Veronica; Carretero, Miguel A.; Kaliontzopoulou, Antigoni] Univ Porto, CIBIO Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, InBIO, Campus Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas 7, P-4485661 Vairao, Vila Do Conde, Portugal; [Gomes, Veronica] Univ Porto, Dept Biol, Fac Ciencias, Oporto, Portugal","Gomes, V (corresponding author), Univ Porto, CIBIO Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, InBIO, Campus Vairao,Rua Padre Armando Quintas 7, P-4485661 Vairao, Vila Do Conde, Portugal.; Gomes, V (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Dept Biol, Fac Ciencias, Oporto, Portugal.",veronica.a.s.g@gmail.com,"Carretero, Miguel A/A-1472-2013; Gomes, Veronica/I-3662-2014; Kaliontzopoulou, Antigoni/L-8345-2013","Carretero, Miguel A/0000-0002-2335-7198; Gomes, Veronica/0000-0002-3179-2691; Kaliontzopoulou, Antigoni/0000-0002-7897-7204","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT, Portugal)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/93237/2013]; IF contract by FCT, Portugal [IF/00641/2014/CP1256/CT0008]; FEDER funds through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors-COMPETE; National Funds through FCT [UID/BIA/50027/2013, POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006821]","VG was supported by a doctoral grant (SFRH/BD/93237/2013) from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT, Portugal).

In 1 year, mature plants were also more abundant at the boundary between the seagrass beds than in either bed. Field experiments and programmes of sampling were used to investigate three potential explanations for the unusual distribution of this alga: (1) that the availability of substrata suitable for attachment of the alga differed between the two seagrass beds; (2) that mortality of mature C. duthieae differed between the seagrass beds; and/or (3) that the intensity of recruitment was different in the two seagrass beds. C. duthieae plants were exclusively epibionts of the bivalve Anadara trapezia. Detailed sampling showed that the abundance of A. trapezia was similar in both seagrass beds and that the distribution of bivalves suitable as substrata for C. duthieae plants was not obviously related to proximity to the boundary between the beds. Two experiments investigated the survival of C. duthieae plants in each bed. In the first, mature C. duthieae plants transplanted into the P. australis bed suffered similar rates of mortality to plants which were disturbed and moved within the Z. capricorni bed or which were left undisturbed in the Z. capricorni bed. Fewer of the host bivalves were recovered from the Z. capricorni bed, however, indicating that the mechanism of mortality differed between the beds, hosts being more frequently dislodged in the Z. capricorni bed. Removal of the leaves of the seagrasses had consistently greater effects on near-bottom current velocities in the Z. capricorni bed than in the Ft australis bed and significantly increased mortality of C. duthieae in the Z. capricorni bed. Survival of plants was greater in plots of artificial leaves of P. australis placed in the Z. capricorni bed than in plots of the natural Z. capricorni leaves or plots where the natural leaves were removed. Most mortality in the Z. capricorni bed was due to dislodgement of the alga and its bivalve substratum. Corresponding manipulations of leaves in the P. australis bed had consistently smaller effects on survivorship of both the alga and its host. Patterns in the recruitment of the alga most clearly reflected the distribution of adults. C. duthieae recruits were 5 times more abundant in the Z. capricorni bed and at the boundary between the two beds than in the Fl australis bed. The results demonstrate how habitat structure, provided by the canopy of leaves of the two species of seagrass, can have contrasting effects on the recruitment and mortality of a macroalga. In the case of C. duthieae, it appears that the differential pattern of recruitment is the primary determinant of the distribution of adult plants.","UNIV SYDNEY, SCH BIOL SCI, SYDNEY, NSW 2006, AUSTRALIA","INGLIS, GJ (corresponding author), JAMES COOK UNIV N QUEENSLAND, DEPT TROP ENVIRONM STUDIES & GEOG, TOWNSVILLE, QLD 4811, AUSTRALIA.",,,,,,,74,9,10,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,1994,99,3-4,,,,,352,365,,10.1007/BF00627749,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PP227,WOS:A1994PP22700018,28313891,,,,2021-09-27,

These fishes hence are excellent model systems for studying evolutionary adaption to specific microhabitats. Using a sample of Gobiodon histrio and G. rivulatus and their most important host corals (Acropora digitifera and A. gemmifera) from the northern Red Sea, we assess (1) how corals that are occupied by gobies differ in their architecture from colonies that are not occupied and (2) how fish body shape is associated with the architecture of their host coral. Fish body shape was assessed by geometric morphometric techniques. Coral measurements included colony size, branch length (BL), and interbranch as well as branch tip distance of adjacent branches, for which we applied a new and non-destructive measurement technique based on casts of two-component epoxy resin. The most important factor influencing the occupation of corals was a BL of more than 5 cm. The distance between coral branches was clearly related to the width of the fishes and hence constrained overall fish size. G. histrio and G. rivulatus differ in adult body shape as well in their allometric development of lateral body compression, resulting in different maximum body sizes attainable in the restricted interbranch space of corals. The strong dependence of coral-associated fishes on large coral colonies with specific architectures increases the extinction risk of fishes within deteriorating coral reefs.","[Untersteggaber, Lucien; Herler, Juergen] Univ Vienna, Fac Life Sci, Dept Integrat Zool, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Mitteroecker, Philipp] Univ Vienna, Fac Life Sci, Dept Theoret Biol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Herler, J (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Fac Life Sci, Dept Integrat Zool, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",juergen.herler@univie.ac.at,"Mitteroecker, Philipp/A-1591-2012","Mitteroecker, Philipp/0000-0002-5308-3837","FWF (Austrian Science Fund)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 21616-B12]; International Relations Office of the University of Vienna; Focus of Excellence Biometrics of EvoDevo of the Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Vienna; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 21616] Funding Source: researchfish","We would like to thank M.

Here we investigate its interaction with another key process in vegetation dynamics-fire. We examine ant dispersal of seeds immediately before and after experimental burning in an Australian tropical savanna, one of the world's most fire-prone ecosystems. Specifically, our study addressed the effects of burning on: (1) the composition of ants removing seeds, (2) number of seed removals, and (3) distance of seed dispersal. Fire led to higher rates of seed removal post-fire when compared with unburnt habitat, and markedly altered dispersal distance, with mean dispersal distance increasing more than twofold (from 1.6 to 3.8 m), and many distance dispersal events greater than the pre-fire maximum (7.55 m) being recorded. These changes were due primarily to longer foraging ranges of species of Iridomyrmex, most likely in response to the simplification of their foraging landscape. The significance of enhanced seed-removal rates and distance dispersal for seedling establishment is unclear because the benefits to plants in having their seeds dispersed by ants in northern Australia are poorly known. However, an enhanced removal rate would enhance any benefit of reduced predation by rodents. Similarly, the broader range of dispersal distances would appear to benefit plants in terms of reduced parent-offspring conflict and sibling competition, and the location of favourable seedling microsites. Given the high frequency of fire in Australian tropical savannas, enhanced benefits of seed dispersal by ants would apply for much of the year.","CSIRO, Bushfire Cooperat Res Ctr, Trop Ecosyst Res Ctr, Winnellie, NT 0822, Australia; Ecole Natl Super Agron Montpellier, F-34060 Montpellier, France","Parr, CL (corresponding author), CSIRO, Bushfire Cooperat Res Ctr, Trop Ecosyst Res Ctr, PMB 44, Winnellie, NT 0822, Australia.",kate.parr@csiro.au,"Parr, Catherine L/G-2831-2011; Andersen, Alan N/F-8763-2010","Andersen, Alan N/0000-0003-1487-3323; Parr, Catherine/0000-0003-1627-763X",,,,53,64,64,3,55,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,FEB,2007,151,1,,,,,33,41,,10.1007/s00442-006-0570-5,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,123WB,WOS:000243325800004,17033801,,,,2021-09-27,

Unusually, both the males and females of Spesbona angusta (Odonata: Platycnemididae), Red Listed as Endangered, are capable of rapid and reversible colour change. There is only one known population of this species, which occurs in a unique habitat in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. Appreciation of this unusual phenomenon of distinct physiological colour change helps us appreciate that we need to conserve phenomena in the insect world as well as the species themselves. Using controlled experiments, we evaluated the importance of ambient temperature as the possible primary cue for physiological colour change. We found that S. angusta responds rapidly to short-term changes in ambient temperature, even in the absence of additional environmental stimuli and without the body temperature matching the ambient temperature. Colour change is reversible when temperature returns to its earlier level. The reason why S. angusta shows this rapid and reversible colour change may be a combination of reproductive enhancement, competitive advantage and thermoregulation. This colour change appears to have strong selective advantage in a very particular habitat type, meaning that careful conservation of its habitat in all respects is important, and must be considered in any possible future translocations.","[Deacon, Charl; Samways, Michael J.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, Matieland, South Africa","Deacon, C (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, Matieland, South Africa.",charldeacon@sun.ac.za,,"Samways, Michael J./0000-0003-4237-6025","National Research Foundation, South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa","Funding was from the National Research Foundation, South Africa.

The aim was to analyse the effects of the life phase (juvenile and adult) and schooling patterns (school and solitary) on the feeding behaviour (foraging rates and substratum preferences) of four species of the genus Haemulon (Haemulon aurolineatum, Haemulon parra, Haemulon plumieri and Haemulon squamipinna). PERMANOVA analysis (P < 0 center dot 05) indicated that ontogenetic changes and schooling patterns directly influence foraging behaviour. Schooling individuals had low foraging rates (mean +/- s.d. = 2 center dot 3 +/- 2 center dot 1 bites 10 min1) and mobility, usually remaining near the bottom; however, solitary fishes had high foraging rates (mean +/- s.d. = 12 center dot 5 +/- 4 center dot 6 bites 10 min1). Juveniles preferred feeding in the water column (75% of the total number of bites), whereas adults foraged mainly in sand (80%) and bare rock (20%). All four Haemulon species displayed similar patterns of feeding behaviour as well as preferences for foraging sites and display competition for food resources. In contrast, little is known about their habitat use and foraging behaviour over the diel cycle, particularly the newly settled and early juvenile stages.

We use a combination of a 10-year field study of a perch (Perca fluviatilis) population and quantitative within-season modeling of individual and population-level dynamics to investigate which mechanisms are most likely to drive the dynamics of the studied perch population. We focused on three main aspects to explain observed discrepancies between earlier model predictions and data: (1) introduction of more than one shared resource between cannibals and victims, (2) whether or not several victim age cohorts are necessary to allow giant growth, and (3) the intensity of inter-cohort competition between young-of-the-year (YOY) perch and 1-yr-old perch. At the start of the study period, the perch population was dominated by stunted perch individuals, and recruitment of perch to an age of 1-yr-old was negligible. Following a major death in adult perch, strong recruitments of perch to 1-yr-old were thereafter observed for a number of years. As 1-yr-olds these successful recruiters subsequently starved to death due to competition with the new YOY. The few surviving adult perch accelerated substantially in growth and became giants. At the end of the study period, the perch population moved back to the situation with stunted individuals. There was a high agreement between observed diets of cannibalistic perch and those predicted by the model for both the stunted and the giant phases. Analyses of growth rates showed that cannibalistic perch could become giants on a diet of YOY perch only, but that a supplement with the second shared resource (macroinvertebrates) was needed to reach the observed sizes. Modeling of growth and diet in the giant phase showed an exploitative competitive effect of YOY perch on 1-yr-old perch, but a restriction in habitat use of 1-yr-old perch had to be assumed to yield the observed growth rate and diet. The resource dynamics of zooplankton and macroinvertebrates were both accurately predicted by the model. Also, YOY perch mortality was accurately predicted and, furthermore, suggested that one of the trawling methods used may underestimate the number of YOY perch when they increase in size. We conclude that the presence of a second shared resource and the restricted habitat use and absence of cannibalistic consumption by 1-yr-old perch individuals are two important mechanisms to explain the discrepancy between model predictions and data. Our results also point to the fact that that the dynamics observed may be explained by complex dynamics not involving the presence of a giant and dwarf cycle.","Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, NL-1090 GB Amsterdam, Netherlands","Persson, L (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",Lennart.Persson@eg.umu.se,"Claessen, David/S-7596-2017; Persson, Lennart/B-2885-2012; De Roos, Andre M./A-1590-2008","Claessen, David/0000-0001-7354-1316; De Roos, Andre M./0000-0002-6944-2048",,,,58,77,77,0,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9615,1557-7015,,ECOL MONOGR,Ecol.

Microhabitats can serve multiple functions for Centruroides vittatus (Say 1821), but a particular microhabitat can be preferred for a certain function such as a refuge, foraging, or feeding. Observations of microhabitat use by C. vittatus were performed in Laredo, Texas of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province. Comparisons of microhabitat use by C. vittatus at different temperatures or precipitation levels were performed. Foraging and feeding by C. vittatus among microhabitat classes were also compared. The observed use of vegetation by C. vittatus (luring different seasons was compared to the expected use based oil relative abundance of vegetation in the habitat. Air temperature, but not precipitation, had a significant effect on microhabitat use by C. vittatus. Microhabitat had a significant effect oil foraging of C. vittatus with caterpillars comprising 34.6% of the prey items and half of the scorpions feeding oil caterpillars were in blackbrush (Acacia rigidula). The lowest proportion of scorpions observed feeding was oil the ground (3.8%) and the highest in blackbrush (40.4%). The frequency of C. vittatus among vegetation classes was significantly different compared to the relative abundance of plant species in the plot. Scorpions were observed oil prickly pear cactus (Opuntia engelmannii) and strawberry cactus (Echinocereus enneacanthus) at a higher frequency than expected, and scorpions were observed oil guajillo (Acacia berlandieri) and tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis) at a lower frequency than expected. The frequency of scorpions oil blackbrush was higher than expected during the spring. Vegetation is an important microhabitat for C. vittatus in south Texas. The results indicate the possibility, that C. vittatus in south Texas used various plant species to carry prey captured oil the ground into vegetation to feed, used blackbrush to forage for caterpillars, and used strawberry and prickly pear cacti as a possible refuge.","Texas A&M Int Univ, Dept Biol & Chem, Laredo, TX 78041 USA","McReynolds, CN (corresponding author), Texas A&M Int Univ, Dept Biol & Chem, Laredo, TX 78041 USA.",nmcreynolds@tamiu.edu,,,Texas A&M International University,"I thank my undergraduate research students from Fall 2000 to Spring 2005 for assistance in the field to collect the data for the paper.

We studied whether the abundance of red wood ants Formica rufa -group is related to the breeding habitat selection, fecundity and offspring quality in the Eurasian treecreeper Certhia familiaris, an old-growth forest passerine. The nest-box occupancy data were gathered over a five-year study period, whereas the breeding performance analyses were based on a two-year data set. The abundance of wood ants, measured within 50 m around the nest-boxes, was not related to nest-box occupancy rate, fecundity or the physiological stress of nestlings. In contrast, the abundance of wood ants was negatively related to the offspring quality and life-history traits, such as lowered body mass, subcutaneous fat reserves, and tarsus length at fledging. Our results suggest that exploitative competition between distantly related taxa may have considerable and adverse influences on nestling quality as measured by body mass, subcutaneous, fat and tarsus length.

Crayfish act as indicators of water quality and function as keystone species in aquatic food webs; however, there is a paucity of research on how crayfish may respond to elevated CO2. This study quantified how shelter-seeking behavior in freshwater crayfish (e.g., family Cambaridae), a behavior critical for survival and fitness, may change following exposure to elevated pCO(2). Red Swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii, Girard, 1852) were exposed to one of three potential levels of dissolved CO2 that could be found in freshwater basins currently or under future climate change conditions: Control (< 100 mu atm), Low (6853 +/- 1206 mu atm), and High (19,086 +/- 2043 mu atm) for 8 days, and were then transferred to a treatment aquarium with the same CO2 levels as the respective initial exposure. The treatment aquarium contained a shelter and was divided into three equal sections based on proximity to that shelter. Crayfish proximity to the shelter (defined by the tank sections) in the treatment aquarium was monitored every 5 s for a 2-min trial. Crayfish spent differing amounts of time in differing zones of the experiment and had different levels of activity, depending on their pCO(2) exposure; crayfish acclimated to High pCO(2) increased their time spent hiding and decreased their overall activity when compared to the Low pCO(2) and Control treatments. Augmented shelter-seeking behavior may affect crayfish social hierarchies, feeding, mating, and mortality, which could generate cascading effects on the ecology of many freshwater ecosystems.","[Robertson, M.

We evaluated the relationship between rapid habitat change and the volume of the medial, lateral, and dorsal cortices, in two populations of wild male and female Lesser Earless Lizards (Holbrookia maculata). These populations inhabit neighboring, but physically distinct, environments in southern New Mexico: White Sands and dark soil habitats. The White Sands habitat is a geologically recent environment that formed over the last 2,000-7,000 yr. There is a stark physical contrast between White Sands and the surrounding typical Chihuahuan desert habitat that is characterized by dark soil, denser vegetation, and higher competitor and predator species abundances. We observed differences in the volumes of the medial cortex, an important neuroanatomical structure for navigation, but not in those of the dorsal or lateral cortices, between lizards inhabiting the White Sands and dark soil habitats. Male and female lizards in the White Sands habitat had smaller medial cortices (relative to their overall brain size) compared to those in the dark soil environment. We also found sex differences in the volume of the medial cortex; in the dark soil habitat, males had larger medial cortices than females.

Body size affects trophic interactions like foraging ability and vulnerability to predation, which in turn affect individual fitness as well as population stability and extinction risk. Experimental and theoretical work has shown that the size distribution of individuals within cohorts is strongly influenced by intraspecific competition for resources, often leading to skewed frequency distributions. However, little is known about the effects of environmental factors such as climate and eutrophication on the cohort size-structure of natural populations. We use a long-term time series of scientific monitoring of a freshwater fish (European perch Perca fluviatilis) to investigate the effects of density dependence, predation, nutrient availability, climate and the timing of spawning on the cohort size distributions. We find that the mean length of the fish is best predicted by the extrinsic factors phosphorus concentration and summer temperature, and the densities of the different age-classes, whereas the skewness of the length distribution is best predicted by phosphorus concentration, summer temperature, abundance of small fish, and the timing of spawning. Higher nutrient levels, temperatures and densities of small fish increase food availability and thus reduce competition, which is reflected in increased mean length and decreased skewness. The timing of spawning affects skewness presumably through changes in the initial size variation of the cohort and the length of the first growth season. Our results indicate that higher temperatures increase the mean length and decrease skewness due to the concurrent eutrophication of the lake. The study thereby highlights the potential impact of human-induced environmental change on the size structure of fish populations. More studies are needed to understand better the complex mechanisms through which these factors alter the intensity of intraspecific competition in fish communities.","[Ohlberger, Jan; Otero, Jaime; Stenseth, Nils Chr; Vollestad, L.

Juveniles and adult tilapia were either stocked alone or combined in the same proportion at 20 and 40 g/m(3). Because tilapias show an ontogenetic niche shift from visual predation on zooplankton to filter (suction) feeding on both zooplankton and phytoplankton, we expected differences in the biomass-related effects of juveniles and adults on plankton communities. Our results show that rotifer abundances were higher in treatments stocked with juvenile tilapia whereas cladoceran abundances were higher in treatments stocked with adults. However, total zooplankton and copepod abundances, chlorophyll a concentrations and Secchi depth were not affected by tilapia size, suggesting that variation in the feeding mode of tilapias affects the structure of zooplankton communities but that this does not cascade down to affect phytoplankton biomass and water transparency. Competitive interactions among the fish constrained their potential to depress zooplankton abundances and increase algal biomass as fish-stocking biomass increased. Competition among size classes of tilapias was highly asymmetric and juveniles were better competitors than adults for plankton resources in our experimental ponds.","[Attayde, Jose Luiz; Menezes, Rosemberg F.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Ctr Biociencias, Dept Bot Ecol & Zool, BR-59072970 Natal, RN, Brazil","Attayde, JL (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Ctr Biociencias, Dept Bot Ecol & Zool, BR-59072970 Natal, RN, Brazil.",attayde@cb.ufrn.br,"Menezes, Rosemberg Fernandes/V-1695-2017; Attayde, Jose/C-4009-2015","Menezes, Rosemberg Fernandes/0000-0001-9949-8221; Attayde, Jose/0000-0002-8372-4172",,,,33,18,19,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-7873,1464-3774,,J PLANKTON RES,J.

Studying predation in micromolluscs is especially critical in evaluating the adaptive significance of small size against predation and assessing the evolutionary implication of predator-prey size relationship (PPSR). This study documents a drilling predation event in microbivalves from the lower Miocene (Burdigalian) fossil assemblage of Quilon Limestone from Kerala, India. Our sample of over 2000 valves represents nine families with an average drilling frequency (DF) of 0.06 and an incomplete drilling frequency (IDF) of 0.26. The characteristic drillhole morphology and occurrence of five genera of modern drilling gastropods (Naticid: Natica, Tanea and Polinices; Muricid: Triplex and Dermomurex) from the same locality reveal the predator identity. Predation in the studied assemblage is found to be highly selective in terms of prey taxa, size, mobility and site selection. Six out of nine families show predatory drilling indicating taxon selectivity. Poor correlation between DF and abundance further supports this view. Failed attacks are strongly correlated with morphological features such as surface ornamentation (Lucinidae) and presence of conchiolin layers (Corbulidae). Drilling occurs primarily on medium size class; prey outside this size range show lower rates of attack. This indicates the existence of a negative size refugia for extremely small prey along with the classical size refugia existing for large prey. Mobility is found to be an effective defense against drilling predation. Microbenthos of the Quilon Limestone shows a lower predation intensity in comparison to the Miocene macrobenthos worldwide including coeval formations of the Kutch Basin. The interaction in the microbenthos is more strongly size-dependent in contrast to the Kutch fauna. Reduced predation intensity in the microfauna and the existence of negative size refugia support the claim of micromorphy acting as a defense mechanism and highlights the role of size-dependent predation in marine benthos.","[Chattopadhyay, Debarati; Kella, Venu Gopal S.; Chattopadhyay, Devapriya] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res IISER Kolkata, Dept Earth Sci, Mohanpur 741246, WB, India; [Kella, Venu Gopal S.; Chattopadhyay, Devapriya] IISER Pune, Dept Earth & Climate Sci, Dr Homi Bhaba Rd, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India","Chattopadhyay, D (corresponding author), IISER Pune, Dept Earth & Climate Sci, Dr Homi Bhaba Rd, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India.",devapriya@iiserpune.ac.in,,,Academic Research Grant of IISER Kolkata [ARF 2018-19]; IISER Kolkata graduate research fellowship; DST Inspire fellowship,"This work was supported by the Academic Research Grant of IISER Kolkata (ARF 2018-19), IISER Kolkata graduate research fellowship and DST Inspire fellowship.

Little is known about the effects of phyB on emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which play a major role as informational cues in indirect defense. We investigated the effects of phyB on direct and indirect defenses in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) using two complementary approaches to inactivate phyB: illumination with a low red to far-red ratio, simulating competition, and mutation of the two PHYB genes present in the tomato genome. Inactivation of phyB resulted in low levels of constitutive defenses and down regulationof direct defenses induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Interestingly, phyB inactivation also had large effects on the blends of VOCs induced by MeJA. Moreover, in two-choice bioassays using MeJA-induced plants, the predatory mind bug Macrolophus pygmaeus preferred VOCs from plants in which phyB was inactivated over VOCs from control plants. These results suggest that, in addition to repressing direct defense, phyB inactivation has consequences for VOC-mediated tritrophic interactions in canopies, presumably attracting predators to less defended plants, where they are likely to find more abundant prey.","[Cortes, Leandro E.; Ballare, Carlos L.] Univ Buenos Aires, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, IFEVA, Ave San Martin 4453,C1417DSE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Cortes, Leandro E.; Boccalandro, Hernan E.] Univ Nacl Cuyo, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Biol Agr Mendoza, Almirante Brown 500, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina; [Weldegergis, Berhane T.; Dicke, Marcel] Wageningen Univ, Entomol Lab, POB 16, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Ballare, Carlos L.] Univ Nacl San Martin, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, IIB INTECH, B1650HMP, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Ballare, CL (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, IFEVA, Ave San Martin 4453,C1417DSE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.; Ballare, CL (corresponding author), Univ Nacl San Martin, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, IIB INTECH, B1650HMP, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",ballare@ifeya.edu.ar,"Dicke, Marcel/B-2300-2010; Ballare, Carlos L/F-5141-2011","Dicke, Marcel/0000-0001-8565-8896; Ballare, Carlos L/0000-0001-9129-4531; Weldegergis, Berhane T./0000-0001-8838-7876",CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); ANPCyT (Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica)ANPCyT; UBACyT (Universidad de Buenos Aires Ciencia y Tecnica); Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [SPI 87-313],"This research was financially supported by grants from CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas), ANPCyT (Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica) and UBACyT (Universidad de Buenos Aires Ciencia y Tecnica) to C.L.B., and a Spinoza award of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO, SPI 87-313) to M.D, We thank Amy Austin for discussion and comments on the manuscript; Patricia Demkura and Miriam Izaguirre for their help with determination of phenolic compounds and PCR measurements; Patricia Fernandez for her help with preliminary VOC experiments; Diego Bastos Silva for advice on Y-tube olfactometer assays and insect manipulations; Joop Woelke and Andre Gidding for rearing insects; and Unifarm (Wageningen, the Netherlands) for growing the plants.",,110,25,26,2,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0028-646X,1469-8137,,NEW PHYTOL,New Phytol.,DEC,2016,212,4,,,,,1057,1071,,10.1111/nph.14210,,,15,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,ED9KQ,WOS:000389189100005,27689843,,,,2021-09-27,

Aphidophagous insect larvae are notorious for cannibalism and intraguild predation, as they compete for aggregated but ephemeral prey. We tested for indirect effects of competitors on the development of Coleomegilla maculata DeGeer and Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and a green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea Stephens (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), with all larvae reared on eggs of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Control larvae were reared singly, while treatment larvae were reared pairwise, with either a conspecific or heterospecific, in partitioned Petri dishes that allowed the passage of chemical cues. Larvae of C. maculata, a dietary generalist, appeared stressed by the presence of competing larvae, whether con-or heterospecific, and suffered fitness costs (longer pupation times, lower male adult mass). In contrast, H. convergens and C. carnea, both aphid specialists, responded to competing larvae with accelerated development, and without any apparent costs in terms of adult size or reproductive performance. Adult C. carnea in some treatments were heavier than solitary controls, suggesting a higher consumption rate by the induced phenotype, and those exposed to H. convergens began oviposition earlier. Thus, the phenotypes induced in the specialized aphid predators were adaptive for development in aphid colonies, whereas that induced in the generalist was not. These results indicate that nonconsumptive effects are not simply a vertical force acting on prey, but can also impact conspecific and heterospecific competitors on the same trophic level.","[Michaud, J.

However, indirect mechanisms, such as differences in herbivore pressure mediated by microhabitat differences, could create the same pattern of variation. In this study, we investigated the effect of insect herbivore pressure on the growth of the grassland cactus Opuntia fragilis under different regimes of grassland canopy cover. Our purpose was to establish the extent to which canopy cover plays a direct, competitive role versus an indirect, mediatory role in cactus growth. We manipulated aboveground microhabitat, specifically the cover of adjacent grasses. The three treatments were: (1) open canopy, with grass pinned down away from the cactus; (2) shaded canopy, with a partial mesh cage staked over the cactus; and (3) ambient grass canopy. We measured seasonal plant growth and recorded changes in insect herbivore occurrence and damage in relation to cover. Cactus growth, defined as the change in number of live cladodes, was higher in the open than under either treatment where the plant was more shaded (P < 0.05). However, allocation to new growth, measured as the proportion of new segments (cladodes) in a patch, did not differ among cover treatments. Thus, the hypothesis that physiological constraints, or competition for light, limited cactus performance in grass is rejected. Instead, we found that both cladode mortality, caused by the larvae of a cactus moth borer (Melitara dentata), and occurrence of the moth were lower in the open microhabitat than in either shaded microhabitat. Thus, higher net growth in the open, unshaded treatment, rather than representing a release from competition for light with grasses, was better explained as an indirect effect of grass cover on the activity and impact of the cactus moth. These results show that indirect effects can lead to a misinterpretation of experimental data on direct effects. These data also contribute to an improved understanding of mixed results in the biological control of weedy cacti. Clearly, future evaluations of the relative importance of physiology, competition, and insect herbivory in plant performance must be environmentally explicit.","UNIV NEBRASKA, CEDAR POINT BIOL STN, LINCOLN, NE 68588 USA","BURGER, JC (corresponding author), UNIV NEBRASKA, SCH BIOL SCI, LINCOLN, NE 68588 USA.",,,,,,,58,39,42,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,1994,99,1-2,,,,,79,87,,10.1007/BF00317086,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PJ341,WOS:A1994PJ34100011,28313951,,,,2021-09-27,

Facing extreme environmental conditions the activity rhythm of animals may change. The activity patterns of Geoffroy's cats (Leopardus geoffroyi) were studied during a period of prey scarcity in a scrubland area of central Argentina, based on five individuals radio-collared and monitored by radio-telemetry. Activity readings were recorded every 15 min during 6- to 24-h observation periods, and a total of 3121 fixes totaling 780.3 h of monitoring were gathered for these cats. Geoffroy's cats were significantly more active during daytime (58.1 +/- 9.4% of active fixes) than during the night (33.6 +/- 2.9%). Although they were active at any time of the day, an activity peak was recorded from 12.00 to 17.00 h. This pattern is opposite to those observed in other areas or even to that recorded for this species in the same area during a period of higher prey abundance. This apparent shift toward diurnal activity could be a response to a combination of ecological (prey availability, predators or competition avoidance) and physiological (energy saving) factors. Geoffroy's cats are behaviorally flexible, but this ability may not be enough to maintain survival (and population size) under harsh environmental conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluated if males of the South American tree frog (Hypsiboas pulchellus) select calling sites in undisturbed subtropical wetlands based on specific habitat cues. The study was designed to represent a snapshot of the male calling activity under low densities of intra-and interspecific competitors and little variation of climatic conditions. We characterized calling sites by measuring the vegetation attributes and flood levels of calling sites occupied by 59 males and comparing them to available microhabitats. We found that males exhibit some degree of selectivity for calling sites, often selecting microhabitats with greater density of vegetation > 50 cm tall. Calling site selection was not affected by water depth or area flooded. Most individuals vocalized in sites near the ground (<= 25 cm), a pattern that is the contrary to that expected to maximize sound propagation. We suggest that, due to the open habitat of the studied area, the choice of calling sites is more related to the need for shelter from predation and avoidance of desiccation and heat loss than to bioacoustic performance.","[Pio da Silva dos Santos, Nathalia Luiz; de Avila, Fernanda Rodrigues; de Oliveira, Mateus; Tozetti, Alexandro Marques] Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Programa Posgrad Biol, Lab Ecol Vertebrados Terr, Ave Unisinos 950, BR-93022970 Sao Leopoldo, SP, Brazil; [Colombo, Patrick] Fdn Zoobot Rio Grande Sul, Museu Ciencias Nat, Secao Zool Vertebrados, Rua Doutor Salvador Franca 1-427, BR-90690000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil","dos Santos, NLPD (corresponding author), Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Programa Posgrad Biol, Lab Ecol Vertebrados Terr, Ave Unisinos 950, BR-93022970 Sao Leopoldo, SP, Brazil.",alexandro.tozetti@gmail.com,"Colombo, Patrick/D-2989-2013","Rodrigues de Avila, Fernanda/0000-0002-1572-2722; Colombo, Patrick/0000-0003-3957-3255",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [446910/2014-7]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [2556/10]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do SulFundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS),"We thank many students from Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos, Laboratorio de Ecologia de Vertebrados Terrestres for their field assistance.

Aim To assess if nestboxes of different construction and colour were occupied differently by breeding tits and affected breeding success. Methods A total of 292 nestboxes of different construction and colour were placed in a range of habitats and their occupancy, and the clutch size, brood size and number of young fledged of the birds that used them were measured. Results Overall 272 tit nests were included in the analysis. Although there were species-related differences in the occupancy of the different types of nestboxes, more tits nested in the boxes constructed from woodcrete (64% of nests) compared to the wooden boxes (36%). More tits nested in green (72%) rather than brown boxes (28%) and in boxes with entrance holes (68%) rather than wedges (32%). The clutch size, brood size and number of young fledged did not vary in relation to nestbox type. Conclusion Within the parameters of the experimental design of this study, tits are more likely to nest in woodcrete boxes than in wooden boxes, and in wooden boxes that are-green and have holes rather than brown boxes with wedge entrances. It is likely that the smaller internal volume, internal darkness, insulating properties and perceived protection from predation were the reasons for these differences.","Game Conservancy Trsut, Fordingbridge SP6 1EF, Hants, England","Browne, SJ (corresponding author), Game Conservancy Trsut, Fordingbridge SP6 1EF, Hants, England.",sbrowne@gct.org.uk,,,,,,19,14,16,1,17,BRITISH TRUST ORNITHOLOGY,THETFORD NORFOLK,"NUNNERY, NUNNERY PLACE, THETFORD NORFOLK IP24 2PU, ENGLAND",0006-3657,,,BIRD STUDY,Bird Stud.,JUL,2006,53,,2,,,,187,192,,10.1080/00063650609461432,,,6,Ornithology,Zoology,060AV,WOS:000238774500011,,Bronze,,,2021-09-27,

In future scenarios of ocean acidification, calcifying organisms are expected to be less competitive: among these two key elements of the rocky subtidal food web, coralline algae and sea urchins. In order to highlight how the effects of increased pCO(2) on individual calcifying species will be exacerbated by interactions with other trophic levels, we performed an experiment simultaneously testing ocean acidification effects on primary producers (calcifying and non-calcifying algae) and their grazers (sea urchins). Artificial communities, composed by juveniles of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and calcifying (Corallina elongata) and non-calcifying (Cystoseira amentacea var stricta, Dictyota dichotoma) macroalgae, were subjected to pCO(2) levels of 390, 550, 750 and 1000 mu atm in the laboratory. Our study highlighted a direct pCO(2) effect on coralline algae and on sea urchin defense from predation (test robustness). There was no direct effect on the non-calcifying macroalgae. More interestingly, we highlighted diet-mediated effects on test robustness and on the Aristotle's lantern size. In a future scenario of ocean acidification a decrease of sea urchins' density is expected, due to lower defense from predation, as a direct consequence of pH decrease, and to a reduced availability of calcifying macroalgae, important component of urchins' diet. The effects of ocean acidification may therefore be contrasting on well vegetated macroalgal assemblages and barren grounds: in the absence of other human impacts, a decrease of biodiversity can be predicted in vegetated macroalgal assemblages, whereas a lower density of sea urchin could help the recovery of shallow subtidal rocky areas affected by overfishing from barren grounds to assemblages dominated by fleshy macroalgae.","[Asnaghi, Valentina; Chiantore, Mariachiara] DiSTAV Univ Genoa, Genoa, Italy; [Asnaghi, Valentina; Mangialajo, Luisa; Francour, Patrice] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, EA ECOMERS 4228, Nice, France; [Gazeau, Frederic; Alliouane, Samir; Gattuso, Jean-Pierre] CNRS INSU, Lab Oceanog Villefranche, Villefranche Sur Mer, France; [Gazeau, Frederic; Alliouane, Samir; Gattuso, Jean-Pierre] Univ Paris 06, Observ Oceanol Villefranche, Villefranche Sur Mer, France","Asnaghi, V (corresponding author), DiSTAV Univ Genoa, Genoa, Italy.",valentina.asnaghi@unige.it,"Gattuso, Jean-Pierre/E-6631-2010; Gazeau, Frederic/G-3050-2011; Gattuso, Jean-Pierre/AAG-8643-2019","Gattuso, Jean-Pierre/0000-0002-4533-4114; Gazeau, Frederic/0000-0001-8807-4597; Gattuso, Jean-Pierre/0000-0002-4533-4114; Asnaghi, Valentina/0000-0003-1659-2613; Francour, Patrice/0000-0002-8489-1319","European CommunityEuropean Commission [211384, 222492]; Mediterranean Sea Acidification under a changing climate project (MedSeA) [265103]; Universita Italo-francese","This work is a contribution to the European Project on Ocean Acidification (EPOCA) which received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no 211384 and to the Mediterranean Sea Acidification under a changing climate project (MedSeA) under grant agreement no 265103.

Its reliance on older forests has resulted in concerns about its status, extensive research into its habitat relationships, and litigation. Our objective was to model the spatial patterns of goshawk territories in the Black Hills, South Dakota, to make inferences about the underlying processes. We used a modification of Ripley's K function that accounts for inhomogeneous intensity to determine whether territoriality or habitat determined the spacing of goshawks in the Black Hills, finding that habitat conditions rather than territoriality were the determining factor. A spatial model incorporating basal area of trees in a stand of forest, canopy cover, age of trees >23 cm in diameter, number of trees per hectare, and geographic coordinates provided good fit to the spatial patterns of territories. There was no indication of repulsion at close distances that would imply spacing was determined by territoriality. These findings contrast with those for the Kaibab Plateau, Arizona, where territoriality is an important limiting factor. Forest stands where the goshawk nested historically are now younger and have trees of smaller diameter, probably having been modified by logging, fire, and insects. These results have important implications for the goshawk's ecology in the Black Hills with respect to mortality, competition, forest fragmentation, and nest-territory protection.","[Klaver, Robert W.] Iowa State Univ, US Geol Survey, Iowa Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Backlund, Douglas] S Dakota Game Fish & Pk, S Dakota Nat Heritage Program, Pierre, SD 57501 USA; [Bartelt, Paul E.] Waldorf Coll, Dept Biol, Forest City, IA 50436 USA; [Erickson, Michael G.] S Dakota Dept Environm & Nat Resources, Pierre, SD 57501 USA; [Knowles, Craig J.; Knowles, Pamela R.] Fauna W Wildlife Consultants, Townsend, MT 59644 USA; [Wimberly, Michael C.] S Dakota State Univ, Geog Informat Sci Ctr Excellence, Brookings, SD 57007 USA","Klaver, RW (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, US Geol Survey, Iowa Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",bklaver@iastate.edu,,"Wimberly, Michael/0000-0003-1549-3891","Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Program R12, South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks; U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey","This project was funded through the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Program R12, South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks, and the U.S. Geological Survey.

The purpose of this study was to measure the effects of significant seasonal seaweed deposition events, caused by hurricanes and other storms, on species inhabiting subtropical islands. The seaweed represents a pulsed resource subsidy that is consumed by amphipods and flies, which are eaten by lizards and predatory arthropods, which in turn consume terrestrial herbivores. Additionally, seaweed decomposes directly into the soil under plants. We added seaweed to six shoreline plots and removed seaweed from six other plots for three months; all plots were repeatedly monitored for 12 months after the initial manipulation. Lizard density (Anolis sagrei) responded rapidly, and the overall average was 63% higher in subsidized than in removal plots. Stable-isotope analysis revealed a shift in lizard diet composition toward more marine-based prey in subsidized plots. Leaf damage was 70% higher in subsidized than in removal plots after eight months, but subsequent damage was about the same in the two treatments. Foliage growth rate was 70% higher in subsidized plots after 12 months. Results of a complementary study on the relationship between natural variation in marine subsidies and island food web components were consistent with the experimental results. We suggest two causal pathways for the effects of marine subsidies on terrestrial plants: (1) the fertilization effect in which seaweed adds nutrients to plants, increasing their growth rate, and (2) the predator diet shift effect in which lizards shift from eating local prey (including terrestrial herbivores) to eating mostly marine detritivores.","[Spiller, David A.; Piovia-Scott, Jonah; Wright, Amber N.; Schoener, Thomas W.] Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Spiller, David A.; Piovia-Scott, Jonah; Wright, Amber N.; Schoener, Thomas W.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Yang, Louie H.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Takimoto, Gaku] Toho Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Chiba 2748510, Japan; [Iwata, Tomoya] Univ Yamanashi, Dept Ecosocial Syst Engn, Yamanashi 4008511, Japan","Spiller, DA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",daspiller@ucdavis.edu,"Piovia-Scott, Jonah/W-9308-2019","Wright, Amber/0000-0002-9078-0324; Iwata, Tomoya/0000-0003-4258-0050; Yang, Louie/0000-0002-9237-5357","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0516431]; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [H09]; Toho UniversityToho University","We thank the National Science Foundation (DEB-0516431), the 21st Century COE Program of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (H09 to the University of Yamanashi), and a Faculty of Science Special Grant for Promoting Scientific Research at Toho University for support.

Here we examine the role of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in the detoxification of dietary allelochemicals in the digestive gland of the predatory gastropod Cyphoma gibbosum, a generalist consumer of gorgonian corals. Controlled laboratory feeding experiments were used to investigate the influence of gorgonian diet on Cyphoma GST activity and isoform expression. Gorgonian extracts and semi-purified fractions were also screened to identify inhibitors and possible substrates of Cyphoma GSTs. In addition, we investigated the inhibitory properties of prostaglandins (PGs) structurally similar to antipredatory PGs found in high concentrations in the Caribbean gorgonian Plexaura homomalla. Principal Findings: Cyphoma GST subunit composition was invariant and activity was constitutively high regardless of gorgonian diet. Bioassay-guided fractionation of gorgonian extracts revealed that moderately hydrophobic fractions from all eight gorgonian species examined contained putative GST substrates/inhibitors. LC-MS and NMR spectral analysis of the most inhibitory fraction from P. homomalla subsequently identified prostaglandin A(2) (PGA(2)) as the dominant component. A similar screening of commercially available prostaglandins in series A, E, and F revealed that those prostaglandins most abundant in gorgonian tissues (e. g., PGA(2)) were also the most potent inhibitors. In vivo estimates of PGA(2) concentration in digestive gland tissues calculated from snail grazing rates revealed that Cyphoma GSTs would be saturated with respect to PGA(2) and operating at or near physiological capacity. Significance: The high, constitutive activity of Cyphoma GSTs is likely necessitated by the ubiquitous presence of GST substrates and/or inhibitors in this consumer's gorgonian diet. This generalist's GSTs may operate as 'all-purpose' detoxification enzymes, capable of conjugating or sequestering a broad range of lipophilic gorgonian compounds, thereby allowing this predator to exploit a range of chemically-defended prey, resulting in a competitive dietary advantage for this species.","[Whalen, Kristen E.; Hahn, Mark E.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Lane, Amy L.; Kubanek, Julia] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Kubanek, Julia] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Whalen, KE (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Ctr Marine BioInnovat, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",whalen@msi.ucsb.edu,"Hahn, Mark/AAV-7516-2020","Hahn, Mark/0000-0003-4358-2082; Lane, Amy/0000-0002-8386-364X; Kubanek, Julia/0000-0003-4482-1831",Ocean Life Institute; Robert H.

Mosquitoes able to monopolize treeholes with optimal resources may be over-represented in the community. Aedes sierrensis, which is well adapted for the Mediterranean climate of California, has evolved in the absence of interspecific competition, so oviposition should reflect resource quality to a large extent. Artificial oviposition traps mounted at four canopy heights facing north or south on trees in a mixed-oak forest at four elevations of the Pacific Coastal Range were used to assess vertical ovipositional preferences by the western treehole mosquito. Natural dispersal of the ciliated protozoan parasite Lambornella clarki was similarly monitored. Gravid Ae. sierrensis showed no vertical stratification during egg laying in traps. Lambornella clarki were naturally dispersed at relatively low frequency into traps and persisted unless eliminated by larval predation. Aedes sierrensis is not currently constrained into occupying a subset of treeholes. However, invasion of its native range by competitive species may alter oviposition patterns.

We investigated bowfin foraging ecology by determining trophic position, isotopic niche size, dietary proportions, and the degree of individual specialization at two locations in the Lake Huron Erie Corridor using carbon (6(13)C) and nitrogen (6(15)N) stable isotopes and stomach content analysis. Trophic position did not differ between Mitchell's Bay (4.2) and Peche Island (43) using 6(15)N, but both sites had large ranges in individual estimates (range = 2.8). Bowfin isotopic niche size was large across site, season, and tissue, suggesting a generalist feeding strategy at the population level. However, bowfin had greater between individual than within-individual variation accounting for 72% and 88% of total niche size at Mitchell's Bay and Peche Island, respectively, suggesting specialist feeding strategies at the individual level. Stable isotope mixing models for Peche Island showed high proportions of crayfish (54%) and small fish (Cyprinidae spp., Lepomis spp.; 38%) in their diet, consistent with high stomach content prevalence for crayfish (spring = 75%, fall = 10%) and small fishes (spring = 19%, fall = 33%) at Peche Island. Overall, our analysis of bowfin suggests a complex foraging ecology with bowfin acting as generalist predators at the species level but exhibiting a high degree of individual specialization, warranting further study to assess their trophic role in this diverse ecosystem of conservation concern.

We conducted 4 waterbird-exclusion experiments in a transformed marshland in Donana Natural Park (southwestern Spain) and compared benthic macroinvertebrates in 3 x 3-m control (no exclusion) and test plots from which Greater Flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber or all waterbirds were excluded. The 4 experimental periods coincided with the waterbird breeding season (summer), postbreeding period (autumn), wintering period (winter), and pre- and early breeding season (spring). Densities of waterbirds were relatively low compared to densities reported in other studies, but we found strong effects of excluding flamingos and waterfowl on the structure of the benthic community in autumn, winter, and spring. In winter, numbers of polychaetes and chironomids were nearly 2x higher in exclusion than in control plots. The difference in macroinvertebrate biomass among treatments was strongest in winter when benthic dry mass was similar to 2x higher in flamingo exclosures than in control plots and similar to 2x higher in all-bird exclosures than in flamingo exclosures. Macroinvertebrate richness was 15% lower in control than in all-bird exclosures in winter and 25% lower in control than in all-bird exclosures in spring. Our results suggest that benthic macroinvertebrate communities in this wetland are affected more by predation, bioturbation, and waterbird herbivory than by competition. These findings suggest that waterfowl and the increasing population of flamingos are of great importance in structuring shallow lakes in the Mediterranean region.","[Rodriguez-Perez, Hector; Green, Andy J.] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Wetland Ecol, Seville 41092, Spain","Rodriguez-Perez, H (corresponding author), Stn Biol Tour Valat, F-13200 Arles, France.",hector.hrp@gmail.com; ajgreen@ebd.csic.es,"Green, Andy J/A-5189-2008","Green, Andy J/0000-0002-1268-4951",Consejeria de Medio Ambiente; CSIC-I3P programme; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF),"Maria del Mar Delgado provided invaluable assistance processing samples.

J,"Wheeler, BC; Hammerschmidt, K",,,,"Wheeler, Brandon C.; Hammerschmidt, Kurt",,,Proximate Factors Underpinning Receiver Responses to Deceptive False Alarm Calls in Wild Tufted Capuchin Monkeys: Is It Counterdeception?,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,vocal communication; deception; skeptical responding; signal reliability; pragmatics; playback experiments,CEBUS-APELLA; COMMUNICATION; SIGNALS; VOCALIZATIONS; SQUIRREL; EMOTION; WOLF,"Previous research demonstrates that tufted capuchin monkeys use terrestrial predator alarm calls in a functionally deceptive manner to distract conspecifics when feeding on contestable resources, although the success of this tactic is limited because listeners frequently ignore these calls when given in such situations. While this decreased response rate is suggestive of a counterstrategy to deception by receivers, the proximate factors underpinning the behavior are unclear. The current study aims to test if the decreased response rate to alarm calls in competitive contexts is better explained by the perception of subtle acoustic differences between predator-elicited and deceptive false alarms, or by receivers varying their responses based on the context in which the signal is received. This was tested by first examining the acoustic structure of predator-elicited and deceptive false alarms for any potentially perceptible acoustic differences, and second by comparing the responses of capuchins to playbacks of each of predator-elicited and false alarms, played back in noncompetitive contexts. The results indicate that deceptive false alarms and predator-elicited alarms show, at best, minimal acoustic differences based on the structural features measured. Likewise, playbacks of deceptive false alarms elicited antipredator reactions at the same rate as did predator-elicited alarms, although there was a nonsignificant tendency for false alarms to be more likely to elicit escape reactions. The lack of robust acoustic differences together with the high response rate to false alarms in noncompetitive contexts suggests that the context in which the signal is received best explains receiver responses. It remains unclear, however, if listeners ascribe different meanings to the calls based on context, or if they generally ignore all signals in competitive contexts. Whether or not the decreased response rate of receivers directly stems from the deceptive use of the calls cannot be determined until these latter possibilities are rigorously tested. Am. J.

The leeward/west coast of the island of Hawai'i consists of the largest expanse of intact reefs in the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI), yet little is known about the health of its coral communities. We measured prevalence of coral diseases and non-disease conditions at nine regions across two depths in the summer and winter months between 2010 and 2011. We also assessed long-term changes in coral cover (2003-2011). Mean prevalence of chronic diseases was 5-21 times greater than previously reported for the MHI. Coral health varied minimally across survey months with mild seasonality only detected in algal overgrowth (ALOG). Coral health varied considerably by depth and site, and was primarily driven by the most prevalent and common conditions: Porites growth anomalies (13.7 +/- A 0.82 %), Porites trematodiasis (9.5 +/- A 0.90 %), discoloration (5.6 +/- A 0.33 %), ALOG (9.9 +/- A 0.54 %), and gastropod predation (2.4 +/- A 0.23). While several conditions were significantly elevated in shallow zones, unique site x depth interactions suggest that specific site-level factors are driving prevalence. At the coast-wide level, percentage of coral cover did not change significantly between 2003 and 2011, but decreased significantly at two sites and increased at one site. Based on coral cover decline and high prevalence of certain coral health conditions, we identified four regions of concern (PuakAi, Mauna Lani, Ka'A << pA << lehu, and HAinaunau). The high spatial variation in coral health not only advances our understanding of coral disease ecology, but also supports reef resilience planning by identifying vulnerable areas that would benefit most from targeted conservation and management efforts.","[Couch, C.

This gives them a competitive advantage under oligotropihc conditions, where nutrients and bacteria concentrations are low. As the advantage for the mixotroph depends on light, the competition between mixo- and heterotrophic bacterivores should be regulated by light. To test this hypothesis, we incubated natural plankton from the ultra-oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean in a set of mesocosms maintained at 4 light levels spanning a 10-fold light gradient. Picoplankton (heterotrophic bacteria (HB), pico-sized cyanobacteria, and small-sized flagellates) showed the fastest and most marked response to light, with pronounced predator-prey cycles, in the high-light treatments. Albeit cell specific activity of heterotrophic bacteria was constant across the light gradient, bacterial abundances exhibited an inverse relationship with light. This pattern was explained by light-induced top-down control of HB by bacterivorous phototrophic eukaryotes (PE), which was evidenced by a significant inverse relationship between HB net growth rate and PE abundances. Our results show that light mediates the impact of mixotrophic bacterivores. As mixo- and heterotrophs differ in the way they remineralize nutrients, these results have far-reaching implications for how nutrient cycling is affected by light.","[Ptacnik, Robert; Moorthi, Stefanie D.; Ptacnikova, Radka; Striebel, Maren] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, ICBM, Schleusenstr 1, DE-26382 Oldenburg, Germany; [Ptacnik, Robert; Ptacnikova, Radka; Schabhuettl, Stefanie] WasserCluster Lunz Biol Stn GmbH, Dr Carl Kupelwieser Promenade 5, A-3293 Lunz Am See, Austria; [Gomes, Ana; Royer, Sarah-Jeanne; Calbet, Albert; Gasol, Josep M.; Isari, Stamatina; Martinez, Rodrigo A.] CSIC, Inst Ciencias Mar, Pg Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, E-08003 Barcelona, Catalunya, Spain; [Berger, Stella A.; Nejstgaard, Jens C.; Tsagaraki, Tatiana M.] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, POB 7803, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Berger, Stella A.; Nejstgaard, Jens C.] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Expt Limnol, Dep 3,Alte Fischerhutte 2, D-16775 Stechlin, Germany; [Isari, Stamatina] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Biol & Environm Sci & Engn Div, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Striebel, Maren] European Inst Marine Studies, Technopole Brest Iroise, Plouzane, France; [Sazhin, Andrey F.] RAS, PP Shirshov Inst Oceanol, 36 Nahimovski Prospect, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Tsagaraki, Tatiana M.; Pitta, Paraskevi] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Oceanog, POB 2214, Iraklion 71003, Crete, Greece; [Zervoudaki, Soultana] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Oceanog, POB 712, Anavyssos 19013, Greece; [Altoja, Kristi; Laas, Peeter] Tallinn Univ Technol, Marine Syst Inst, Akad Rd 15A, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia; [Tsagaraki, Tatiana M.; Dimitriou, Panagiotis D.; Santi, Ioulia; Sousoni, Despoina] Univ Crete, Dept Biol, Voutes Univ Campus, Iraklion 70013, Crete, Greece; [Gazihan, Ayse] Middle E Tech Univ, Inst Marine Sci, POB 28, TR-33731 Mersin, Turkey; [Schabhuettl, Stefanie] Univ Vienna, Dept Limnol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Ptacnik, R (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, ICBM, Schleusenstr 1, DE-26382 Oldenburg, Germany.; Ptacnik, R (corresponding author), WasserCluster Lunz Biol Stn GmbH, Dr Carl Kupelwieser Promenade 5, A-3293 Lunz Am See, Austria.",robert.ptacnik@wcl.ac.at,"Nejstgaard, Jens/ABB-8903-2020; Calbet, Albert/A-7779-2008; Striebel, Maren/AAF-9996-2019; Ptacnik, Robert/B-1347-2012; Laas, Peeter/O-1466-2019; Gasol, Josep M M/B-1709-2008; Isari, Stamatina/J-6987-2014; Tsagaraki, Tatiana/Y-5584-2018","Nejstgaard, Jens/0000-0003-1236-0647; Calbet, Albert/0000-0003-1069-212X; Striebel, Maren/0000-0003-2061-2154; Ptacnik, Robert/0000-0001-7176-7653; Gasol, Josep M M/0000-0001-5238-2387; Isari, Stamatina/0000-0003-3457-0274; Dimitriou, Panagiotis D./0000-0001-9613-8300; Tsagaraki, Tatiana/0000-0002-3006-2232; Santi, Ioulia/0000-0002-0202-8256; Laas, Peeter/0000-0001-9393-9022; Ptacnikova, Radka/0000-0002-6592-5130; Zervoudaki, Soultana/0000-0002-3499-8433; Sousoni, Despoina/0000-0002-5426-7881",European Union Seventh Framework Program MESOAQUA (FP7) [228224]; German Research CouncilGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG Pt 5/3-1]; Spanish project REMEI from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CTM2015-70340]; project PROTOS from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CTM2009-08783],"The experiment was financed by the European Union Seventh Framework Program MESOAQUA (FP7/2009-2013) coordinated by JCN under grant agreement no. 228224.

These are male courtship displays produced by upwardly swimming male Photeros (formerly Vargula) annecohenae, small (<2 mm) myodocopid ostracod crustaceans, attempting to attract females, which approach males while remaining photically quiescent. Observations in both the laboratory and the field revealed different behaviours by males during the courtship period. Using infrared videography in the laboratory to track individuals, we observed distinct male mating behaviours from multiple males in a single tank. Each participating male is capable of ( 1) 'initiating' a luminescent display train (wleaders), ( 2) 'entraining' on another displaying male in loose luminescent synchrony (wfollowers), and ( 3) 'sneaking' silently on a luminescing male. Males can switch among these three tactics even during a single, 10-19 pulse display train (ca. 12 s). The alternative mating tactic chosen by a male is highly predicted by the orientation and distance of the responding male to the initial courtship display at the start of that tactic. Thus, the complex interplay of these different tactics among a group of males even during a single display train is highly choreographed in both time and space. The mating tactics of P. annecohenae are an extreme example of plastic, neuronally controlled courtship behaviour and provide rich new avenues for investigations into understanding communal sexual displays and sexual selection.

Results display a much richer diversity of opinion than is apparent in qualitative consensus summaries, such as those of the IPCC. Experts attach different relative importance to key factors and processes such as soil nutrients, fire, CO2 fertilization, competition, and plant-pest-predator interactions. Assumptions and uncertainties about future fire regimes are particularly crucial. Despite these differences, most of the experts believe that standing biomass in minimally disturbed Northern forests would increase and soil carbon would decrease. There is less agreement about impacts on carbon storage in tropical forests. Estimates of migration rates in northern forests displayed a range of more than four orders of magnitude. Estimates of extinction rates and dynamic response show significant variation between experts. A series of questions about research needs found consensus on the importance of expanding observational and experimental work on ecosystem processes and of expanding regional and larger-scale observational, monitoring and modeling studies.

We studied whether partially sterile T. absoluta males and fully sterile females were capable of suppressing wild populations of this moth in semi-controlled conditions. After irradiating T. absoluta pupae with 200 Gy, emerged males and females were released at 10:1 (treated: untreated) and 15:1 over-flooding ratios inside field cages containing tomato plants. The number of eggs and larvae produced was recorded once per wk during 3 mo. An over-flooding ratio of 10:1 caused a decline in larvae production compared with the untreated control cages, but these differences were not statistically significant. Using an over-flooding ratio of 15:1, the moth population in the cages with irradiated insects decreased significantly compared with those in the untreated control cages. In addition, the possibility of combining inherited sterility and a natural enemy as a strategy to manage this pest was investigated. We studied in no choice and choice tests the predation behavior of females of the egg predator Tupiocoris cucurbitaceus (Hemiptera: Miridae) on eggs derived from the following parental T. absoluta crosses:. female(U) x male(U) (control), female(U) x male(1) and female(1) x male(U) (where U = untreated, I = irradiated). In the no choice test, females of the T. cucurbitaceus readily consumed T. absoluta eggs regardless of their origin. In the choice test, T. cucurbitaceus females consumed similar numbers of eggs of untreated parents and eggs oviposited from crosses in which the male had been irradiated. However, the mirid females preyed on significantly more eggs-roughly 20% more-from irradiated females than on eggs from untreated females. We conclude that it is possible to achieve a certain level of suppression of a T. absoluta wild population through the release of irradiated insects, and that it is technically feasible to combine the use of the predator T. cucurbitaceus with inherited sterility to control this moth pest.","[Cagnotti, Cynthia L.; Andorno, Andrea V.; Hernandez, Carmen M.; Botto, Eduardo N.; Lopez, Silvia N.] INTA Castelar, CNIA, IMYZA, Insectario Invest Lucha Biol, Las Cabanas & De los Reseros S-N CC 25, RA-1712 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Paladino, Leonela Carabajal] Biol Ctr AS CR, Inst Entomol, Branisovska 31, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Cagnotti, CL (corresponding author), INTA Castelar, CNIA, IMYZA, Insectario Invest Lucha Biol, Las Cabanas & De los Reseros S-N CC 25, RA-1712 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",cagnotti.cynthia@inta.gob.ar,"Paladino, Leonela Z Carabajal/I-1361-2014","Paladino, Leonela Z Carabajal/0000-0001-9312-0260","ANPCyT (Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Argentina)ANPCyT [PICT-2007-00486]; IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency)International Atomic Energy Agency [16332]; CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); project Postdoc BIOGLOBE through the EU Education for Competitiveness Operational Programme [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0032]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); Czech State Budget","This work was part of the FAO/IAEA Coordinated Research Project on Increasing the Efficiency of Lepidoptera SIT by Enhanced Quality Control.

Here, we explore the roles of body size, male morph, morph frequency, and alternative reproductive tactics to explain copulation duration in the damselfly Paraphlebia zoe. P.zoe has two male morphs (pigmented or hyaline wings) which differ in reproductive tactics (territorial or non-territorial behaviors). We also analyze the effects of season as the frequencies of both morphs tend to vary along the reproductive season. In the first non-experimental year, we found that the relationship between body size and copulation duration depended on the time of year. Early in the season, body size positively correlated with copulation duration, while late in the year, body size negatively correlated with copulation duration. In the second experimental year (when we reversed the frequency of male morphs in the middle of the season: making pigmented males less frequent than hyaline males), size influenced copulation duration as well as morph body size positively correlated with copulation duration, and hyaline males mated for longer than pigmented males. Contrary to our prediction, changes to the relative abundances of morphs did not influence copulation duration. Hyaline males may be under selection for longer copulation durations to compensate for their reduced access to females, as long copulations potentially lead to more rival sperm to be removed from the female sperm storage organs and/or increased mate guarding. We do not discard, however, other explanations that drive variation in copulation duration such as cryptic female choice and/or predation.","[Wong-Munoz, Jesus; Anderson, Chris N.; Munguia-Steyer, Roberto; Cordoba-Aguilar, Alex] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Evolut, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Anderson, Chris N.] Oberlin Coll, Dept Biol, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA","Cordoba-Aguilar, A (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Evolut, Apdo Postal 70-275,Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",acordoba@ecologia.unam.mx,"Munguia-Steyer, Roberto/U-3935-2019","Munguia-Steyer, Roberto/0000-0002-2951-4684",Programa de Posgrado en Ciencias Biologicas (UNAM); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologiaConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [210545]; UC MEXUS-CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT),"We thank L.

Similarly to species from temperate zones, some species inhabiting arid areas accumulate fat stores prior to periods of food limitation. Yet, we have little knowledge concerning seasonal variation in body composition and the relationship between fat store size and disappearance risk in species from arid habitats. Using the water dilution method, we examined the body composition of African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) living in a seasonal habitat with a long food-restricted dry season. We tested for seasonal changes in body composition (N=159 measurements of 113 individuals) and whether dry season survival was related to fat mass (N=66 individuals). Fat stores were similar in size at the onset and the end of the dry season, but surprisingly smaller at the onset of the moist breeding season. Fat stores showed a negative relationship with food availability. Individual variation in fat stores was not associated with disappearance risk, but there was a positive association of disappearance risk with body mass. Increased disappearance risk of heavy individuals suggests elevated dispersal rates in competitive individuals. This study suggests that non-breeding philopatric striped mice do not accumulate large fat stores prior to the food-limited dry season but that they might mobilize fat stores at the onset of the breeding season to satisfy the energetic demands of reproduction and/or to decrease costs associated with larger fat stores, such as increased predation risk.","[Rimbach, Rebecca; Pillay, Neville; Schradin, Carsten] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Blanc, Stephane; Zahariev, Alexandre; Robin, Jean-Patrice; Schradin, Carsten] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, IPHC UMR 7178, F-67000 Strasbourg, France","Rimbach, R (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",rrimbach@gmail.com,,"Pillay, Neville/0000-0002-0778-726X; robin, jean-patrice/0000-0002-9500-2724; Rimbach, Rebecca/0000-0003-3059-0382; Schradin, Carsten/0000-0002-2706-2960",University of Strasbourg Institute for Advanced Study (USIAS); University of the Witwatersrand; Claude Leon Foundation; National Research Foundation [87769]; Centre National de la Recherche ScientifiqueCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),This work was supported by the University of Strasbourg Institute for Advanced Study (USIAS); the University of the Witwatersrand; the Claude Leon Foundation; the National Research Foundation (grant number 87769); and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.,,88,0,0,0,2,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

Well-defended thorny Acacia trees (A. etbaica) were abundant in low-risk areas where impala aggregated but rare in high-risk areas that impala avoided.

My findings suggest that a positive relationship between female tibia length and the number of emerging spiderlings may underlie male choice for large females. However, this benefit may be mitigated by the longevity costs of courtship.

For three breeding seasons (2002-2004), we measured the number of nestlings, fledglings, and dispersed young that were produced by pairs of Ferruginous Hawks nesting within 2365 km(2) managed by the Bureau of Land Management. We hypothesized that reproductive success would be influenced by nesting substrate, abundance of prey, distance to the closest occupied raptor nest, and distance to the closest active well. Although the Uintah Basin experienced a drought during our entire study, reproductive success was within the range of estimates reported in other studies in the Intermountain West. Each nesting pair produced an average of 1.9 nestlings, 1.3 fledglings, and 0.9 dispersed young. During our study, 17 nestlings and 14 fledglings died; 55% were due to avian predators, 16% to mammalian predators, 10% to unknown predators, 16% to natural causes, and 3% to unknown causes. Avian depredation may have resulted from increased competition among avian predators for scarce prey resources, or from increased use of juvenile Ferruginous Hawks as an alternative prey source by Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in years of low lagomorph abundance. Our results suggest that the level of oil development that occurred during this study did not have an adverse effect on Ferruginous Hawk reproduction; the effect of a higher level of oil development was beyond the scope of this study.","[Keough, Heather L.; Conover, Michael R.; Roberts, Anthony J.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Keough, HL (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",mike.conover@usu.edu,,,"Bureau of Land Management (BLM); Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR); Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, Utah State University","We thank the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR) for supporting this project.

Nevertheless, its effects on population dynamics have received very little attention. In its simplest case, omnivory involves a top consumer, an intermediate consumer, and a resource that is common to both consumers. Simple models predict that the intermediate consumer can only coexist with the top consumer if the former is more efficient in exploiting the common resource, which would imply a net positive effect of the top consumer on the equilibrium density of resources (compared to the situation where only the intermediate consumer is present). Among 22 experimental manipulations of omnivorous top consumers I found only 2 studies in which top consumers had significant positive effects on resources. This discrepancy between experimental results and model predictions is, at least partly, related to deviations of the experimental systems from model assumptions. However, considerations of relative body sizes of intermediate and top consumers suggest, that top consumers having negative net effects on the basic resource should be common in nature. I argue that in systems where intermediate consumers and basic resources are relatively similar in size, but both are much smaller than omnivorous top consumers (e.g. vertebrate omnivores feeding on benthos, soil invertebrates, terrestrial insects etc.), the direct negative effect of top consumers on basic resources should not be outweighed by indirect positive effects, and that other mechanisms (e.g. prey refuges) must be invoked to explain the persistence of intermediate consumers in many natural systems. I further argue that a better knowledge of the population dynamical consequences of omnivory and the role of relative consumer sizes is necessary to improve our understanding of the-trophic dynamics of different kinds of communities.",,"DIEHL, S (corresponding author), UMEA UNIV,DEPT ANIM ECOL,S-90187 UMEA,SWEDEN.",,"Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013; Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051",,,,52,126,127,1,37,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1993,68,1,,,,,151,157,,10.2307/3545321,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MB138,WOS:A1993MB13800019,,,,,2021-09-27,

The results showed that pre-copulatory sexual cannibalism was enhanced when males courted without a gift and this was independent of female hunger.

Research on how leopards respond to human presence and competitors, like other predators, can provide important insights on leopard ecology and conservation in human-dominated regions; however, such research is lacking. Here we used data from field cameras in 2010 and 2011 to examine how human presence, prey, and tigers influence leopard spatiotemporal activity patterns in and around Nepal's Chitwan National Park, part of a global biodiversity hotspot. We found that leopards were adjusting their spatiotemporal activity patterns to both tigers and people, but by different mechanisms. Leopards spatially avoided tigers in 2010, but were generally active at the same times of day that tigers were. Despite pervasive human presence, people on foot and vehicles had no significant effect on leopard detection and space use, but leopard temporal activity was displaced from those periods of time with highest human activity. Temporal displacement from humans was especially pronounced outside the park, where there is a much greater prevalence of natural resource collection by local people.

Seventy-two octopuses were captured, tagged with subcutaneous PIT-tags and released. Nineteen tagged individuals were recaptured (recapture rate: 26.4%) in the same area over the study period, which spanned over 6 months. Population sizes and densities decreased over the study period, from 337 octopuses (8 ind. ha(-1)) in September-October to 105 octopuses (2.5 ind. ha(-1)) in February-March. The highest recruitment probability was estimated to occur at the beginning of the study but it clearly decreased over time, while mortality probability during a fishing period slightly increased. Mean specific growth rate was 0.82 +/- 0.11 day(-1). Individual home range or activity area ranged from 2.8 ha to 7.3 ha (median home range radius: 121.8 m). Overall, these results suggest that human-altered coastal habitats, which are characterized by abundant shelters, abundant food and absence of predators, can act as settlement and growth areas for juveniles and adults of O. vulgaris. Furthermore, the methodologies applied in this study are recommended as innovative tools to improve management actions of coastal resources.","[Arechavala-Lopez, P.; Minguito-Frutos, M.; Follana-Berna, G.; Palmer, M.] Mediterranean Inst Adv Studies IMEDEA CSIC UIB, C Miquel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Mallorca, Spain","Arechavala-Lopez, P (corresponding author), Mediterranean Inst Adv Studies IMEDEA CSIC UIB, C Miquel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Mallorca, Spain.",arechavala@imedea.uib-csic.es,"Lopez, Pablo Arechavala/A-4183-2019; Berna, Guillermo Follana/X-7585-2018; Lopez, Pablo Arechavala/R-6507-2019","Lopez, Pablo Arechavala/0000-0002-6816-8542; Berna, Guillermo Follana/0000-0001-9314-6567; Lopez, Pablo Arechavala/0000-0002-6816-8542; Miquel, Palmer/0000-0002-7875-3673","post-doctoral grant (Juan de la Cierva-Incorporacion) from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [IJCI-2015-25595]; pre-doctoral fellowship (FPIINIA) from the National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA)Instituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA)","This work is a contribution of the Joint Associated Unit IMEDEA-LIMIA.

BRACHYURA; SALT MARSHES; MIRA ESTUARY; RECRUITMENT; ABUNDANCE; PRESETTLEMENT,"Post-settlement processes are a major focus in the study of the dynamics of marine populations and communities. Post-settlement movement of juveniles is an important, but often ignored, process which affects local predator-prey and competitive interactions. We used benthic suction sampling and pitfall traps to examine density and locomotory activity of Carcinus maenas juveniles in different intertidal habitat types in the Rio Mira Estuary, Portugal, to better understand intra-specific interactions in a system where density-dependent processes are known to regulate population dynamics. As expected, significantly higher densities of juvenile shore crabs were found from bare mud compared to densely vegetated habitats. At the time of sampling, small and intermediate stages together outnumbered by far the larger juveniles. Conversely, larger crabs were much more frequent than smaller ones in traps. A locomotory index (LI), i.e. the ratio between crab catch in pitfall traps and their density within their moving range, is proposed as a measure of movement. LI analyses indicated that: (1) movement is an order of magnitude higher in large than small juveniles and much higher in sparse than dense vegetation cover; (2) activity of small juveniles is mostly crepuscular, regardless of vegetation cover; and (3) movement of large juveniles is very limited in dense Zostera patches, but very high in sparsely vegetated areas, during the day and night. These results suggest that small juveniles are relatively protected under dense vegetation cover due to lower mobility of larger crabs, and provide evidence of temporal segregation of activity windows between juvenile crabs of different sizes, which may be a key mechanism to reduce cannibalism and therefore increase the carrying capacity of nursery habitats.

Stresses arise as a consequence of the spatially inhomogeneous tissue growth due to the different activity of healthy and cancer cells inhabiting the various districts of the tissue, an additional piling up effect, induced by stress transferring across the scales, contributing to determine the total stress occurring at the macroscopic level. The spatially inhomogeneous growth rates accompany nonuniform and time-propagating stress profiles, which constitute mechanical barriers to nutrient transport and influence the intratumoral interstitial flow, in this way deciding the starved/feeded regions, with direct aftereffects on necrosis, angiogenesis, cancer aggressiveness and overall tumor mass size. Despite their ascertained role in tumor mechanobiology, stresses cannot be directly appraised neither from overall tumor size nor through standard non-invasive measurements. To date, the sole way for qualitatively revealing their presence within solid tumors is ex vivo, by engraving the excised masses and then observing opening between the cut edges. Therefore, to contribute to unveil stresses and their implications in tumors, it is first proposed a multiscale model where Volterra-Lotka (predator/prey-like) equations describing the interspecific (environment-mediated) competitions among healthy and cancer cells are coupled with equations of nonlinear poroelasticity. Then, an experimental study on mice injected subcutaneously with a suspension of two different cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa-2 and MDA.MB231) was conducted to provide experimental evidences that gave qualitative and some new quantitative confirmations of the theoretical model predictions.","[Carotenuto, A.

These experiments often use population dynamics as fingerprints of ecological and evolutionary processes, assuming that the contributions of all major actors to these dynamics are known. However, bacteria are often neglected although they are frequently present. We argue that even without external carbon input bacteria may affect the experimental outcomes depending on experimental conditions and the physiological traits of bacteria, phytoplankton, and zooplankton. Using a static carbon flux model and a dynamic simulation model, we predict the minimum and maximum impact of bacteria on phytoplankton-zooplankton population dynamics. Under bacteria-suppressing conditions, we find that the effect of bacteria is indeed negligible and their omission justified. Under bacteria-favoring conditions, however, bacteria may strongly affect average biomasses of phytoplankton and zooplankton. The population dynamics may become highly complex, which may result in wrong interpretations when inferring processes (e.g., trait changes) from population dynamic patterns without considering bacteria. We provide suggestions to reduce the bacterial impact experimentally. Besides optimizing experimental conditions (e.g., the dilution rate) the appropriate choice of the zooplankton predator is decisive. Counterintuitively, bacteria have a larger impact if the predator is not bacterivorous as high bacterial biomasses and complex population dynamics arise via competition for nutrients with the phytoplankton. Only at least partial bacterivory minimizes the impact of bacteria. Our results help to improve the design of chemostat experiments and their interpretation, and advance the study of ecological and evolutionary processes in aquatic food webs.","[Raatz, M.; Schalicke, S.; Wacker, A.; Gaedke, U.] Univ Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany; [Sieber, M.] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Biol, Plon, Schleswig Holst, Germany","Raatz, M (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany.",michael.raatz@uni-potsdam.de,"Wacker, Alexander/I-8277-2012","Wacker, Alexander/0000-0001-9687-6477","DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission [WA 2445/8-2, WA 2445/11-1, GA 401/26-1, 1704]","This work was funded by DFG (WA 2445/8-2, WA 2445/11-1, GA 401/26-1) as part of the Priority Programme 1704 (DynaTrait).",,33,4,4,2,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1541-5856,,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR-METH,Limnol.

However, few investigations have quantified the spatial scale over which localized foods affect predator foraging behavior and consumption of incidental prey. In spring 2010, we experimentally tested how point-source foods altered how generalist predators (white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus) utilized space and depredated two incidental prey items: almonds (Prunus dulcis; highly profitable) and maple seeds (Acer saccharum; less profitable). We estimated mouse population densities with trapping webs, quantified mouse consumption rates of these incidental prey items, and measured local mouse activity with track plates. We predicted that 1) mouse activity would be elevated near full feeders, but depressed at intermediate distances from the feeder, 2) consumption of both incidental prey would be high near feeders providing less-preferred food and, 3) consumption of incidental prey would be contingent on predator preference for prey relative to feeders providing more-preferred food. Mouse densities increased significantly from pre- to post-experiment. Mean mouse activity was unexpectedly greatest in control treatments, particularly <15 m from the control (empty) feeder. Feeders with highly preferred food (sunflower seeds) created localized refuges for incidental prey at intermediate distances (15 to 25 m) from the feeder. Feeders with less-preferred food (corn) generated localized high risk for highly preferred almonds <10 m of the feeder. Our findings highlight the contingent but predictable effects of locally abundant food on risk experienced by incidental prey, which can be positive or negative depending on both spatial proximity and relative preference.","[Schartel, Tyler E.; Schauber, Eric M.] So Illinois Univ, Cooperat Wildlife Res Lab, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Schartel, Tyler E.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Schauber, Eric M.] So Illinois Univ, Ctr Ecol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Schartel, Tyler E.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA","Schartel, TE (corresponding author), So Illinois Univ, Cooperat Wildlife Res Lab, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.; Schartel, TE (corresponding author), So Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.; Schartel, TE (corresponding author), Mississippi State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",tes164@msstate.edu,"Schauber, Eric/K-4043-2019","Schauber, Eric/0000-0002-0667-2604",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0743759],"The research described in this manuscript was supported by the National Science Foundation (http://www.nsf.gov/) under Grant No. 0743759.

Mate-finding failure, a common mechanism contributing to demographic Allee effects, is usually difficult to demonstrate because of the arduous nature of sampling individuals at very low densities. In a rising outbreak of the eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), we used caged and tethered virgin females in traps to measure mating success over population densities ranging from deep endemic to outbreak conditions. We found that mating success increased with increasing population density, and that at endemic population densities, females experienced difficulties attracting males and mating, demonstrating for the first time a mate-finding Allee effect in the spruce budworm. The relationship between population density and mating success is nonlinear. As population density increased, the proportion of mated females eventually reached a plateau and mating success was not 100% even at the highest moth densities, probably due to female reluctance to mate and perhaps interference competition by males for access to females. Both laboratory-reared and wild females were equally effective in synthesizing pheromone, attracting males, and mating. Our results strongly suggest that a mate-finding Allee effect is involved in maintaining low-density spruce budworm populations below an Allee threshold where they fail to grow. Factors such as changes in predation pressure and immigration could help populations overcome this Allee threshold.","[Regniere, Jacques; Delisle, Johanne; Pureswaran, Deepa S.] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada; [Trudel, Richard] Soc Protect Forets Insectes & Malad, Quebec City, PQ G1N 4B8, Canada","Regniere, J (corresponding author), Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, POB 10380 Stn Ste Foy, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada.",Jacques.Regniere@RNCan-NRCan.gc.ca,"Pureswaran, Deepa/G-8074-2019",,Canadian Forest ServiceNatural Resources CanadaCanadian Forest Service; SERG-International; Societe de Protection des Forets contre les Insectes et Maladies (SOPFIM); Forest Protection Limited (FPL); Government of Quebec; Government of Ontario; Government of Manitoba; Government of Saskatchewan; Government of Alberta,"This research was funded by the Canadian Forest Service, and by members of SERG-International, including the Societe de Protection des Forets contre les Insectes et Maladies (SOPFIM), Forest Protection Limited (FPL), and the Governments of Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.",,46,43,43,1,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-8703,1570-7458,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

Using a new exclosure experiment design adapted to the shifting nature of foraging microhabitat of interior wetlands, we found that shorebird predation did not significantly deplete total invertebrate density or total biomass in open (no exclosure) versus exclosure treatments. Chironomids and oligochaetes were the most common invertebrates occurring in substrate samples. The density of oligochaetes was lower in open treatments, though the degree of difference varied both spatially and temporally. Shorebird density was positively correlated with the amount of invertebrate biomass removed from the substrate during the late-May sampling period. Our results suggest that shorebirds use an opportunistic foraging strategy and consume the most abundant invertebrate prey. The dynamic hydrology at our study site likely played a role in preventing invertebrate depletion by continually exposing new foraging areas and prey.","Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Ctr Wildlife & Plant Ecol, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Shell Vivarium, Dept Anim Biol, Champaign, IL 61820 USA","Hamer, GL (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 13 Nat Resources, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",ghamer@msu.edu,,,,,,58,11,14,1,10,WILSON ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC,WACO,"5400 BOSQUE BLVD, STE 680, WACO, TX 76710 USA",1559-4491,,,WILSON J ORNITHOL,Wilson J.

In many poeciliid fish, males harass females for copulations, which is thought to reduce female fitness by lowering foraging efficiency and increasing predation risk, energetic expenditure and the likelihood of disease transmission. Mating may also be costly for males, who often engage in aggressive interactions with other males in addition to expending energy pursuing females. We examined the effects of three operational sex ratios on male behaviour, female fitness and male body condition in the western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, during a 10-week experiment. Despite a significant reduction in male harassment, female growth and reproductive success decreased as the proportion of females increased. Results suggest that increases in female density had a strong, negative effect on female fitness, overwhelming any potential costs of male harassment. Aggressive behaviour between males increased and male copulation rate decreased as the proportion of males increased, suggesting that operational sex ratio influences the number of copulations that a male attempts by altering the frequency of agonistic interactions with other males and the number of females available to mate.

The impact of the different predator communities (protists and metazoans) of prokaryotes was estimated by water fractionation (< 5 mu m: treatment filtered on 5 mu m, without ciliates and metazoans; UNF: unfiltered treatment with all planktonic communities). Enrichments of natural viruses (< 1.2 mu m: with a natural virus concentration; < 1.2 mu m V and VV: with enrichment leading to a double or triple concentration of viruses, respectively) were used to indirectly assess the control of virioplankton. Viral activity was estimated from the frequency of visibly infected cells (FVIC). PCC was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). In this study, PCC was affected by the eukaryote communities (especially flagellates), and viruses to a lesser extent. Cyanobacteria declined significantly during the experiment and were highly correlated with the FVIC. In addition, the 503-bp terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) disappeared in treatments with virus enrichments, suggesting possible viral-associated mortality processes, whereas the 506-bp T-RF was not affected in these treatments. On one hand, these results suggest a control of the PCC: first, by viral lysis of some dominant phylotypes and second, by interspecific competition between resistant strains for the uptake of substrates released by this lysis. The increase of Archaea may suggest that these cells benefit such resources. On the other hand, the disappearance and the stable proportion of some dominant phylotypes suggested a selection pressure due to the predatory activity on prokaryotes. In conclusion, prokaryotic abundance appears to be mainly controlled by flagellate protists, which also affected PCC, whereas viruses seemed to be essentially responsible for profound changes in PCC via direct and indirect actions.","Univ Clermont Ferrand, Lab Biol Protistes, CNRS, UMR 6023, F-63177 Aubiere, France","Bettarel, Y (corresponding author), Univ Clermont Ferrand, Lab Biol Protistes, CNRS, UMR 6023, F-63177 Aubiere, France.",didier.debroas@free.fr,"Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/M-4134-2019; Jardillier, Ludwig E/H-8486-2015","Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; Jardillier, Ludwig E/0000-0003-4982-5807",,,,61,25,26,3,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0095-3628,1432-184X,,MICROB ECOL,Microb.

Using 20 spatially isolated patch reefs, I factorially manipulated the presence and absence of resident predators (groupers and dottybacks) and potential competitors (damselfishes) to determine whether and how they affect subsequent recruitment and mortality of newly settled fishes. During the 50-day experiment at Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, western Pacific), prior residency by predators dramatically reduced recruitment of damselfish, surgeonfish, butterflyfish, and rabbitfish and increased damselfish recruit mortality. In contrast, prior residency by potential competitors only reduced recruitment of damselfish and rabbitfish and did not affect recruit mortality. Effects of competitors were likely due to aggressive interactions between competitors and recruits that increased susceptibility of recruits to predators. Effects of residents were strongest within 48 hours of settlement, resulting in rapid establishment of patterns that persisted to the conclusion of the experiment. These results are similar to those from a comparable experiment in the Bahamas (western Atlantic), suggesting that priority effects may be a generally important cause of temporal and spatial variability in the composition of reef fish communities.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Almany, GR (corresponding author), James Cook Univ N Queensland, Sch Marine Biol & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",Glenn.Almany@jcu.edu.au,,,,,,63,49,49,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,2004,85,10,,,,,2872,2880,,10.1890/03-3166,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,867LS,WOS:000224844700026,,Green Accepted,,,2021-09-27,

Sea star (Asterias rubens) biomasses, in particular, exceed reported values considered sufficient for restricting mussels to the intertidal zone. To determine how mussels can persist in the face of intense predation, we decomposed patch space occupancy into the relative contributions of newly arriving individuals (recruitment) and of increases in body size of the individuals already present in the patch over 13 mo. Sea stars, as major predators, were only able to control 77% of the potential per capita recruitment rate of 91 individuals/yr in 2 m depth. The remaining recruitment rate of 21 individuals/yr was sufficient to allow patches to occupy 1.6 times more space per year. Transplantation of patches to 6 m depth, where recruitment is negligible, revealed that sea stars were also ineffective in controlling mussel coverage through consumption of larger mussels (>1 yr, >30 mm shell length). In deeper water, space occupancy of patches through increases in mussel body size was able to balance predation mortality, demonstrating that mussels attained a relative refuge in size at only 33 mm shell length. Based on the measured shell growth rates, mussels attain this size after approximate to 15 mo. In situ observations of Asterias feeding activity, the ratios between necessary predator sizes to attack prey of a given size, and predator size distributions suggest that sea stars were on average too small to feed effectively on adult (>1 yr) mussels. Probably, Asterias cannot respond to abundant prey and increase its maximal body size at the site because salinities are at its lower tolerable limit (12-18 g/kg). Thus, bottom-up factors such as high prey productivity in concert with subtle size-based ineffectiveness of the predator population allow otherwise unstable predator-prey populations of a generalist predator and its preferred prey to coexist. Although mussel predators were unable to decimate mussels to local extinction, a release of experimental mussel patches from predation with strong recruitment (2 m depth) resulted in an approximately sevenfold yearly areal increase in shallow treatments, which would lead to a 100% mussel cover at the site within 1 yr. Given that mussels can dominate both rocky substratum and soft sediment, we also studied the effect of substratum quality in factorial combination with presence/absence of predation and water depth on mussel abundance. Attachment to stable substratum did not affect recruitment to the patches or patch space occupancy, but it completely prevented patch dislodgment and subsequent drift. In contrast to rocky shores, mussel patch dislodgment may represent the major mode of patch dispersal and new patch formation in soft-bottom environments as demonstrated by a drift collector fence.","DALHOUSIE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, HALIFAX, NS B3H 4J1, CANADA","Reusch, TBH (corresponding author), INST MEERESKUNDE, ABT MEERESBOT, DUSTERNBROOKER WEG 20, D-24105 KIEL, GERMANY.",,"Reusch, Thorsten B.

Owls hunted at night over open vegetation, when mice were also active. Fluorescent pigment tracking and trapping showed that juvenile mice, especially females, used open vegetation more than adults, and hence were potentially most at risk of predation. On an hourly basis, observations of hunting owls were correlated strongly with the numbers of juvenile females using open vegetation, and less strongly with the numbers of juvenile males. A removal experiment showed that adults partially confine juveniles to open vegetation by interference. These findings suggest that fitness of adults is probably increased by foraging in dense vegetation where resources are abundant and risk of predation from owls is low. In contrast, the foraging decisions of juveniles are balanced both against the risk of predation in open vegetation and interference from adults where cover is dense.","UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA, DEPT ZOOL, NEDLANDS, WA 6009, AUSTRALIA",,,"Dickman, Christopher/Q-4662-2019","Dickman, Christopher/0000-0002-1067-3730",,,,51,96,105,5,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,OCT,1991,62,1,,,,,67,76,,10.2307/3545447,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GP450,WOS:A1991GP45000010,,,,,2021-09-27,

The model used a simple foraging assessment rule to determine the quality of an antlion's location, and antlions relocated randomly in their habitat when a location proved to be of low quality. Shadow competition, or competition for food caused when one sit-and-wait predator intercepts moving prey before a second sit-and-wait predator is encountered, was incorporated into the model by restricting antlions to a bounded arena, and having prey for the antlions enter from the arena periphery. Antlions responded to shadow competition by relocating their pits to peripheral areas of their habitat. This peripheral accumulation of pits was most pronounced when antlion densities were high, and when prey availabilities were intermediate. An experimental test with the antlion Myrmeleon immaculatus supported the importance of shadow competition as a cause of observed pit distributions. Only the treatment which incorporated shadowing had pit distributions near the periphery, while the pit distributions in the control treatments did not differ from randomly generated distributions. We conclude that shadowing can influence sit-and-wait predator distributions when the prey distributions and movements patterns generate the conditions necessary for shadowing. But when prey availability is unpredictable, making assessment of patches difficult, or when prey do not originate in the periphery of the habitat, other factors, such as temperature or moisture, could be more important.",,"LINTON, MC (corresponding author), GOSHEN COLL,DEPT BIOL SCI,GOSHEN,IN 46526, USA.",,,,,,,0,27,27,0,7,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0269-7653,,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

In most social ungulate species, males and females live in separate groups outside the breeding season, sometimes using different home ranges and types of habitat. In most of these species, males are larger than females. Dimorphism in body size can lead to sexual differences in ecology and behavior making it difficult for the two sexes to stay in the same group. It is important for our better understanding of the evolution of sociality, sexual dimorphism and different mating systems to determine why sexual segregation is so widespread not only in ungulates but also in other vertebrates. In this article, I discuss the ecology of the two sexes by reviewing proximate and ultimate causes of sexual segregation. To do this, I compare a range of studies of ruminants and include explanations for social segregation as well as for habitat segregation by gender. This leads into a review and updates current knowledge of the phenomenon. Although I present a number of different hypotheses, I focus in particular on predation risk, forage selection and activity budget and discuss the social-factors hypothesis. I stress that the key in solving the enigma of sexual segregation lies in clearly separating hypotheses that try to explain social segregation and habitat segregation, as well as in including experiments or model systems. To that end, I present a preliminary study on a test of the activity-budget hypothesis in three-spine sticklebacks and explain why 1 believe that shoaling fish are useful for analysing the underlying,T processes and mechanisms that lead to sexual segregation in animals. Lastly, I argue that it is unlikely that a single factor can explain social segregation or habitat segregation but that a model integrating different factors and different levels of segregation might succeed in describing proximate and ultimate causes of sexual segregation.","Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Ruckstuhl, KE (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",kruckstu@ucalgary.ca,"Ruckstuhl, Kathreen Eva/B-4469-2013","Ruckstuhl, Kathreen/0000-0002-2949-242X",,,,75,120,123,1,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1540-7063,1557-7023,,INTEGR COMP BIOL,Integr.

For animals with complex life cycles, conditions in the larval environment can have important effects that persist after metamorphosis. These carry-over effects may influence juvenile growth plasticity and have important fitness consequences. 2. Small juvenile red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, grow faster than larger ones. We examined to what extent this growth pattern is due to carry-over effects of intraspecific larval competition. In particular, we assessed larval gut plasticity and determined whether carry-over effects could persist given the extensive gut remodelling that occurs when herbivorous larvae transition to carnivorous juveniles. 3. We reared larvae in mesocosms at low, medium and high densities and measured the size of both larval and juvenile guts, livers and fat bodies. We also monitored the timing of the onset of juvenile feeding post-metamorphosis and, after the onset of feeding, we measured intake rate and mean diet retention time. Finally, we measured juvenile metabolic rates to determine whether any organ size plasticity contributed to metabolic carry-over effects. 4. Larval density had strong effects on larval morphology with higher densities increasing gut length and decreasing liver and fat body sizes. The effects of this plasticity carried over post-metamorphosis. High larval densities produced smaller juveniles with proportionately longer guts and extremely small livers and fat bodies. There were no apparent carry-over effects on size-specific metabolic rate. 5. Differences in larval density were also associated with differences in post-metamorphic feeding. Small juveniles from high larval densities began feeding even before metamorphosis was complete, whereas large juveniles from low larval densities experienced a significant 2-week delay. Although juvenile body mass varied over threefold across treatments, once feeding was initiated, neither intake nor mean diet retention time scaled with body size. 6. Overall, high larval densities produced small juveniles with very low lipid reserves that may have stimulated hyperphagia relative to larger juveniles. Longer guts carried over from the larval stage could facilitate this by allowing small juveniles to elevate intake without sacrificing diet retention time. Patterns of intake coupled with differences in the onset of feeding explain the size-dependent growth pattern previously reported in this and other species.","[Bouchard, Sarah S.; O'Leary, Chelsea J.; Wargelin, Lindsay J.] Otterbein Univ, Dept Biol & Earth Sci, 1 S Grove St, Westerville, OH 43081 USA; [Charbonnier, Julie F.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, 1000 West Cary St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Warkentin, Karen M.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington Mall, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Warkentin, Karen M.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado Postal 0843-03092, Balboa, Panama","Bouchard, SS (corresponding author), Otterbein Univ, Dept Biol & Earth Sci, 1 S Grove St, Westerville, OH 43081 USA.",sbouchard@otterbein.edu,,"Warkentin, Karen/0000-0002-7804-800X",US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0716923]; Otterbein University; Boston University; Virginia Commonwealth University,"We thank the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) for logistical support and the use of their facilities.

One of the intensely investigated examples of modern parental care are the modern burying beetles (Silphidae: Nicrophorus), a lineage that includes notable endangered species. Here we report diverse transitional silphids from the Mesozoic of China and Myanmar that provide insights into the origins of parental care. Jurassic silphids from Daohugou, sharing many defining characters of Nicrophorinae, primitively lack stridulatory files significant for parental care communications; although morphologically similar, Early Cretaceous nicrophorines from the Jehol biota possess such files, indicating that a system of parental care had evolved by this early date. More importantly, burying beetles of the genus Nicrophorus have their earliest first record in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, and document early evolution of elaborate biparental care and defense of small vertebrate carcasses for their larvae. Parental care in the Early Cretaceous may have originated from competition between silphids and their predators. The rise of the Cretaceous Nicrophorinae implies a biology similar to modern counterparts that typically feed on carcasses of small birds and mammals.","[Cai, Chen-Yang; Huang, Di-Ying] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Thayer, Margaret K.; Newton, Alfred F.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Engel, Michael S.; Ortega-Blanco, Jaime] Univ Kansas, Museum Nat Hist, Div Entomol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Wang, Bo] Univ Bonn, Steinmann Inst, D-53115 Bonn, Germany","Huang, DY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",dyhuang@nigpas.ac.cn,"Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X","National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2012CB821903]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91114201, 41222013, J1210006]; Outstanding Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK2012049]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0542909]; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation","We thank C.

For sexual parasites, this implies a need to switch the host in the search for a mate when potential partners are not available on the same host, although host switching includes risks like starvation and predation. Studies of mate-searching behavior predict that commonly only one sex searches for mating partners while the other remains stationary. In the present work, we experimentally infected rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with the fish ectoparasite Argulus coregoni and determined whether the sex, age and the presence of mating partners influenced the host switching activity. Our results show that increased host switching by A. coregoni occurred only after the parasite reached the adult stage and a difference between the sexes was also recorded. Host switching by mature males was enhanced when no mating partners were present on the same host, whereas females remained mainly stationary on their host regardless of male presence or absence. Our data therefore support the hypothesis that there is a strategic difference in reproductive behavior between males and females; males invest energy in mate searching while females are rather stationary and invest into body size and hence increased fecundity. Our data also showed that leaving the host to find a mate is potentially costly in terms of predation since a substantial number of free-swimming parasites were eaten by fish.","[Bandilla, Matthias; Hakalahti-Siren, Teija; Valtonen, E.

In contrast, competition costs are supposed to set the upper limit to the number of individuals that can forage together. As anti-predator behavior is no longer functional in the absence of predation and competition costs might be affected by resource distribution, the net benefit of aggregation will depend on the particular combination of predation risk and habitat structure experienced by the individual. To test this hypothesis, group-size effects on female time allocation and within-group aggression rate were compared between two guanaco populations exposed to contrasting levels of puma predation. Habitat structure within both sites consisted of mosaics of shrublands and grasslands, and group-size effects were also compared between these habitat types. Females under predation risk showed a strong reduction in vigilance as the number of adults in the group increased, whereas females from the predator-free population showed overall low levels of vigilance, regardless of group size. These results emphasize the anti-predator significance of the group-size effect on female vigilance, as well as guanaco plasticity to adjust time allocation to local conditions. On the other hand, within-group aggression rate increased with the number of adults in the group. Aggression rate was almost null within groups located in grasslands but was significantly higher in shrublands, regardless of predation risk, suggesting that the more heterogeneous distribution of shrubs increases the interference competition level. These results strengthen the notion of predation pressure and habitat structure as major determinants of the balance between costs and benefits of group living, and highlight the potential of individual behavioral patterns to make qualitative predictions about group-size variation within territorial ungulates.","Ctr Nacl Patagon CONICET, Natl Res Council Argentina, Unidad Invest Ecol Terr, Puerto Madryn, Argentina","Marino, A (corresponding author), Ctr Nacl Patagon CONICET, Natl Res Council Argentina, Unidad Invest Ecol Terr, Puerto Madryn, Argentina.",marino@cenpat.edu.ar,,,Rufford Small Grant Foundation,"I thank Lorena Martinez and Pablo Rosso for their assistance with behavioral observations at ML; Alejo Irigoyen, Marcela Nabte, Martin Zamero, Victoria Rodriguez and Gustavo Pazos, Andres Johnson, Bambino Neira, Mariana Martinez and all the staff of Monte Leon National Park, for their support in the field work; to my supervisors Ricardo Baldi and Andres Novaro, Centro Nacional Patagonico and Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas for providing advice, optical equipment and logistical facilities; The Miercoles Group for their early comments on this manuscript, to Ricardo Amoroso for providing statistical advice; and anonymous reviewers for their comments that considerably improved results interpretation.

Here, we examined the ecological, landscape and human factors that may promote human-aggression by raptorial Black kites Milvus migrans in the 16-millions inhabitants megacity of Delhi (India). Physical attacks depended on human activities such as unhygienic waste management, ritual-feeding of kites (mainly operated by Muslims), human density, and presence of a balcony near the nest, suggesting an association between aggression and frequent-close exposure to humans and derived food-rewards. Surprisingly, while more than 100,000 people could be at risk of attack in any given moment, attitudes by local inhabitants were strikingly sympathetic towards the birds, even by injured persons, likely as a result of religious empathy. These results highlight the importance of socio-cultural factors for urban biota and how these may radically differentiate the under-studied cities of developing countries from those of western nations, thus broadening our picture of human-wildlife interactions in urban environments. The rapid sprawling of urban and suburban areas with their associated food-subsidies is likely to increase proximity and exposure of large predators to humans, and vice versa, leading to heightened worldwide conflicts.","[Kumar, Nishant; Gosier, Andrew G.] Univ Oxford, Edward Grey Inst Field Ornithol, Dept Zool, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Kumar, Nishant; Jhala, Yadvendradev, V; Qureshi, Qamar] Wildlife Inst India, Post Box 18, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India; [Gosier, Andrew G.] Inst Human Sci, Sch Anthropol & Museum Ethnog, 58a Banbury Rd, Oxford OX2 6QS, England; [Sergio, Fabrizio] Estn Biol Donana CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, C Americo Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain","Kumar, N (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Edward Grey Inst Field Ornithol, Dept Zool, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.; Kumar, N (corresponding author), Wildlife Inst India, Post Box 18, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India.",nishant.kumar@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Jhala, Yadvendradev/AAL-9711-2020; Sergio, Fabrizio/B-3952-2015","JHALA, YADVENDRADEV/0000-0003-3276-1384; Kumar, Nishant/0000-0002-3505-6800; Sergio, Fabrizio/0000-0002-8024-1773","Raptor Research and Conservation Foundation (Mumbai); Govt. of India, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2015-69445-P]; Felix Scholarship Trust; Somerville College, Oxford University; Feder FundsEuropean Commission","We thank Dr. R.

While it has never been observed in wild orangutans, infanticide by non-sire males has been predicted to occur due to their extremely long inter-birth intervals, semi-solitary social structure, and the presence of female counter-tactics to infanticide. Here, we report on the disappearance of a healthy four-month-old infant, along with a serious foot injury suffered by the primiparous mother. No other cases of infant mortality have been observed at this site in 30 years of study. Using photographic measurements of the injury, and information on the behavior and bite size of potential predators, we evaluate the possible causes of this injury. The context, including the behavior of the female and the presence of a new male at the time of the injury, lead us to conclude that the most likely cause of the infant loss and maternal injury was male infanticide. We suggest that in orangutans, and other species where nulliparous females are not preferred mates, these females may be less successful at using paternity confusion as an infanticide avoidance tactic, thus increasing the likelihood of infanticide of their first-born infants.","[Knott, Cheryl D.; Scott, Amy M.] Boston Univ, Dept Anthropol, 232 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Knott, Cheryl D.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington Mall, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [O'Connell, Caitlin A.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Biol Sci Human & Evolutionary Biol, 3616 Trousdale Pkwy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Scott, Katherine S.] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Social Sci, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; [Lamar, Timothy G.] Harvard Univ, Dept Ornithol, Harvard Museum Comparat Zool, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Riyandi] Univ Tanjungpura, Dept Biol, Jl Dr Hadari Nawawi, Pontianak 7812, Indonesia; [Susanto, TriWahyu] Natl Univ, Dept Biol, Jakarta 1250, Indonesia","Knott, CD (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Anthropol, 232 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.; Knott, CD (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Biol, 5 Cummington Mall, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",knott@bu.edu,,,"Universitas Tanjungpura (UNTAN); Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology; National University of Indonesia (UNAS); Directorate of Natural Resource Conservation and Ecosystems (KSDAE); Gunung Palung National Park office (BTNGP); Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI); Center for Research and Development in Biology (PPPB); Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education (RISTEKDIKTI); National Science Foundation (BCS)National Science Foundation (NSF) [0936199, 9414388]; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; L.S.B.

In a greenhouse experiment, thrips reduced root biomass of seedlings, but not shoot biomass. No correlation was found between density of thrips and change in aboveground area of plants after monitoring for 3 yr in the field. Thrips fed on the phyllaries and corollas of flower heads, as well as on leaves, and were particularly damaging to ray petals. Placed in artificial arrays, flower heads with rays damaged by thrips were less likely to be visited by pollinators than were undamaged flower heads. Plants in a common garden were subjected to three seasons of feeding by either spittle-bugs, plume moth caterpillars, both, or neither. Survival, growth, and flower production were measured for those 3 yr and for an additional 3 yr following the herbivory treatments. Plant survival was unaffected by these insect herbivores, although gophers (Thomomys bottae) were a major source of mortality. Plants with caterpillars produced more rosettes than those without moths. By consuming apical buds the caterpillars released axillary buds, thereby causing plants to produce more side rosettes. This difference in architecture did not result in an increase in flower production. Plants that had experienced 3 yr of spittle-bug or caterpillar attack produced fewer flower heads than controls during their 3rd yr. One year later, and after the herbivory treatments were discontinued, plants that had been damaged by spittlebugs (but not plume moth caterpillars) still produced fewer flowers than those in other treatments. Thereafter, no long-term effects of herbivory could be detected. All three herbivores were found to adversely affect some components of plant growth and reproduction. Because they are consistently abundant at Bodega Bay, these herbivores may reduce the fitness of their host plant.",,"KARBAN, R (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT ENTOMOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,"Strauss, Sharon/J-1827-2012","Strauss, Sharon/0000-0002-6117-4085",,,,26,143,147,4,44,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1993,74,1,,,,,39,46,,10.2307/1939499,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KF775,WOS:A1993KF77500005,,,,,2021-09-27,

To examine the relative influence of these variables on juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Salmon River drainage (ID, USA), we examined diel differences in foraging microhabitats, behaviour and consumption in two areas with consistent differences in parr-to-smolt survival. In lower Big Creek (LBC, high-survival area) and upper Big Creek (UBC, low-survival area), we observed fish by snorkelling, recording length, behaviour (foraging rate and aggression) and physical (depth, velocity, cover, temperature) and biotic (density, size and species of neighbouring fish) microhabitat features. Stomach contents were extracted to estimate consumption. Depth and temperature were greater in LBC, where Chinook salmon were significantly larger and present at lower densities. Fish in LBC exhibited higher foraging activity during the day than night, but there were no size differences between day and night foragers. In UBC, a higher density area, foraging behaviour did not change between day and night, although the smallest size classes did not forage nocturnally. Regression models that integrated physical and biotic variables suggested that physical factors influenced foraging in both areas, but competition also affected foraging in UBC. Our results demonstrate that fish from low- and high-survival populations in Big Creek are exposed to different physical and biological influences during their first growth season, which are reflected in different diel foraging behaviours.","[Cromwell, Kara J.; Kennedy, Brian P.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Resources, Moscow, ID 83844 USA","Cromwell, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Resources, POB 441136, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",kara.cromwell@vandals.uidaho.edu,,,DeVlieg Foundation; NMFS-NWMF,"We thank three anonymous reviewers whose comments guided many improvements to the original manuscript.

While often stigmatized as underperforming compared to conventional systems, sustainable intensification of cropping systems offers an alternative that relies on crop rotation diversity, continuous crop cover, and integrated pest management to combat pests. Within a long-term no-till systems experiment, our main goal was to determine if a high diversity-IPM system (HiDiv-IPM) could compete with a low diversity-preemptive pest management system (LoDiv-PP) in terms of invertebrate pest management, biological control, and maize establishment and yield. Our results suggest that early-season pests, particularly caterpillars, reduced maize establishment by 10 % in the HiDiv-IPM system compared to the LoDiv-PP system. Both our simple and more diverse rotations suffered from slug damage that reduced crop establishment, however, overall slug abundance and damage tended to be equal. Despite lower seedling establishment and greater caterpillar damage, maize in the HiDiv-IPM rotation yielded similarly to the LoDiv-PP rotation, suggesting that other factors, such as higher levels of predation evident in the more diverse rotation or possible nutrient- and soil quality-related issues, contributed to productivity. These results support the notion that a HiDiv-IPM system can compete with a LoDiv-PP system and, contrary to the most common approach for controlling insects in maize production in the U.S., aggressive, preemptive pest management was not necessary to achieve competitive yields.","[Busch, Anna K.; Douglas, Margaret R.; Tooker, John F.] Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Malcolm, Glenna M.; Karsten, Heather D.] Penn State Univ, Dept Plant Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Douglas, Margaret R.] Dickinson Coll, Dept Environm Studies & Environm Sci, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA; [Malcolm, Glenna M.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Tooker, JF (corresponding author), 501 ASI Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",tooker@psu.edu,"Tooker, John/P-6421-2014","Tooker, John/0000-0002-9303-6699","College of Agricultural Sciences at Penn State [LNE09-291, LNE13-129]; USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture Northeast Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) program via an Agroecosystem grant [LNE09-291, LNE13-129]; USDA National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [PEN04600, PEN04606, 1009362]; Hatch Appropriations [PEN04600, PEN04606, 1009362]","Thanks to the staff of the Penn State's Russell E.

Satellite transmitters were deployed on individual right whales in 2004, 2008 and 2009 to investigate whether their space-use patterns in the Southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS) were influenced by environmental conditions and to assess habitat use in areas of human interest. Whales were monitored for an average of 40 d (range 29-58 d) between July and October, a period in which they inhabited the SEBS shelf. Individuals tagged in 2008-2009 (cold years) remained in the middle shelf domain, travelled at a slower rate and showed a spatially more restricted habitat use than a whale tagged in 2004 (a warm year). Monte Carlo tests suggested that NPRWs associated with the cold pool (remnant winter water in the bottom layer of the middle shelf domain) during cold years, which is likely due to higher copepod abundance and reduced competition with other copepod predators within the cold pool. Telemetry data indicated that a Critical Habitat designated by the US National Marine Fisheries Service encompasses the main feeding range of NPRWs in the Bering Sea. Two whales briefly visited the North Aleutian Basin, an area previously considered for oil and gas development. Small sample sizes precluded conclusive comparisons of space-use patterns among years with significantly different temperature regimes, but we hypothesize that habitat use in the SEBS varies with these regimes because of concomitant changes in the abundance of the whales primary copepod prey. Long-term evaluation of space-use patterns of NPRWs is required to further understand their habits in the feeding grounds in light of global warming and the potential for increased anthropogenic activities.","[Zerbini, Alexandre N.; Kennedy, Amy S.; Rone, Brenda K.; Wade, Paul R.; Clapham, Phillip J.] NOAA Fisheries, Natl Marine Mammal Lab, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Zerbini, Alexandre N.] Cascadia Res Collect, Olympia, WA 98501 USA; [Baumgartner, Mark F.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA","Zerbini, AN (corresponding author), NOAA Fisheries, Natl Marine Mammal Lab, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",alex.zerbini@noaa.gov,"Kennedy, Amy/O-9947-2017; Zerbini, Alexandre/ABH-3916-2020; Zerbini, Alexandre/G-4138-2012","Kennedy, Amy/0000-0002-5282-9676; Zerbini, Alexandre/0000-0002-9776-6605; ","North Pacific Research Board (NPRB) [720]; Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM","Assistance with field work was provided by Billy Adams, Catherine Berchok, Cynthia Christman, Jessica Crance, John Durban, Carter Esch, Jeff Foster, Greg Fulling, Yulia Ivashchenko, Don Ljungblad, Nadine Lysiak, Tony Martinez, Laura Morris, Lisa Munger, Sarah Mussoline, Richard Pace, Robert Pitman, Desray Reeb, Allan Sauter, Franchesco Scattorin, and Suzanne Yin.

However, there are only a few estimates for individual taxa. Two top-down (grazing) and bottom-up (phosphorus (P) availability) manipulation experiments were conducted under different light regimes in the NW Mediterranean Sea. Growth rate of different phylogenetic groups, including the Bacteroidetes, Rhodobacteraceae, SAR11, Gammaproteobacteria and its subgroups Alteromonadaceae and the NOR5/OM60 clade, were estimated from changes in cell numbers. Maximal growth rates were achieved in the P-amended treatments but when comparing values between treatments (response ratios), the response to predation removal was in general larger than to P-amendment. The Alteromonadaceae displayed the highest rates in both experiments followed by the Rhodobacteraceae, but all groups largely responded to filtration and P-amendment, even the SAR11 which presented low growth rates. Comparing light and dark treatments, growth rates were on average equal or higher in the dark than in the light for all groups, except for the Rhodobacteraceae and particularly the NOR5 clade, groups that contain photoheterotrophic species. These results are useful to evaluate the potential contributions of different bacterial types to biogeochemical processes under changing environmental conditions.","[Sanchez, Olga] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Genet & Microbiol, Bellaterra 08193, Catalunya, Spain; [Koblizek, Michal] Inst Microbiol CAS, Ctr Algatech, Tebon 37981, Czech Republic; [Gasol, Josep M.; Ferrera, Isabel] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Dept Biol Marina & Oceanog, E-08003 Barcelona, Catalunya, Spain","Ferrera, I (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Dept Biol Marina & Oceanog, E-08003 Barcelona, Catalunya, Spain.",iferrera@icm.csic.es,"Koblizek, Michal/H-2851-2014; Sanchez, Olga/K-8879-2014; Ferrera, Isabel/L-7200-2014","Sanchez, Olga/0000-0003-1254-012X; Ferrera, Isabel/0000-0003-3484-516X","grant REMEI from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitivity [CTM2015-70340-R]; Czech GACRGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [13-11281S]; MSMT project Algatech Plus","We thank Clara Cardelus and all members of the ICM involved in running the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory for sampling and logistics, Eva Hojerova for help during the experiments and Irene Forn for her support with CARD-FISH.

The population ecology of Cosmoclopius nigroannulatus, a predatory reduvid associated with the tobacco culture was investigated aiming to study the population dynamics of adults, along the culture cycle. In an experimental plot of approximately 300 m(2), in Porto Alegre (30 degrees 0'S; 51 degrees 13'W), RS, Brazil, 270 tobacco plants were grown; each plant identified by alphanumeric coordinates. Using the mark-release-recapture method, daily samplings were done from August to December 1999, and three times a week from this date until April 2000. The adults were captured by hand, marked, sexed and released on the same plant they were captured. The individual number and plant coordinate were registered. Population estimates were analyzed by the Fisher-Ford method. In 107 sampling occasions, 604 individuals were marked, 273 males and 331 females. Three generations of C. nigroannulatus were registered during the culture cycle. The colonizing generation was represented by 14 males and 15 females (a sex ratio of 0.48), the first by 109 males and 137 females (0.44) and the second by 150 males and 179 females (0.46). The estimated daily survival rate varied between generations decreasing from 98% in the colonizing generation to 87% in the second. The observed longevity or permanence time in the experimental area varied significantly among generations, being at about 40 days in the colonizing generation, 13 days in the first and 5 days in the second. It was observed that as the population increases, the survival and/or permanence time in the area decreases, suggesting a relation between this and a decline in the available resources probably with an associated increase in intra-specific competition.","[Jahnke, S.

We used giving-up densities (GUDs) in artificial food patches to test whether free-ranging samango monkeys (Cercopithecus (nictitans) mitis erythrarchus) treat food and water as complementary resources and to examine dietary preferences. To assess the influence of water on the value of food, we measured harvest of peanuts from food patches augmented with water. To examine dietary preferences, we measured the harvest of peanuts (as a standard for comparing other food classes), raisins, alfalfa pellets, and either mealworms or cat food mixed into sawdust in separate food patches. In addition, we observed the samangos' order of selection of each food. To differentiate preference from ease of encounter, we measured selectivity for peanuts in triplets of food patches containing 1) peanuts, 2) peanuts mixed with a test food (raisins, alfalfa, or mealworms), and 3) the test food. Water did not influence samango foraging. After peanuts, the samangos treated alfalfa and raisins as approximately equal. The samangos foraged on mealworms lightly and rejected cat food. When each food was mixed with peanuts, the monkeys exhibited an expanding specialist dietary strategy in which they altered their rates of encounter with their preferred foods at high resource densities. Samango monkeys at our study site are not water limited, they consistently favor high-energy foods, and they least often choose animal protein. We conclude that patch-use experiments coupled with direct observations provide a useful means for examining dietary strategy, food preferences, and water limitation.","[Emerson, Sara E.] Kentucky Wesleyan Coll, Dept Biol, Owensboro, KY 42301 USA; [Brown, Joel S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA","Emerson, SE (corresponding author), Kentucky Wesleyan Coll, Dept Biol, Owensboro, KY 42301 USA.",semerson@kwc.edu,,,Animal Behavior Society; UIC LEAP IGERT,"This project was supported by the Animal Behavior Society and the UIC LEAP IGERT.

Such ontogenetic bottlenecks are common in piscivorous fish because competition with future prey may retard growth and prevent a size advantage. In pikeperch (Stizostedion lucioperca), year class strength of 0+ cohorts is highly variable and positively related to early onset of piscivory. To identify the causes of this pattern, we experimentally quantified size-dependent planktivorous and piscivorous foraging capacity and incorporated the data into a growth model. For any given prey type and size, foraging capacity described a hump-shaped relationship with predator size. Foraging capacity on daphnids peaked at a pikeperch length of 66 mm, suggesting a narrow scope of planktivory. The highest capacity in the piscivorous niche was reached at a predator-to-prey length ratio of 5, where the ratio was an integrated measure of predator size over several prey sizes. With the growth model, we derived size distributions of 0+ cohorts as functions of resource levels. Simulations revealed two major determinants for the year class strength of pikeperch. First, discontinuous availability of prey sizes counteracted switching to piscivory within the first growing season. This was accentuated by prey fish growth, which caused the planktivory and piscivory niches to separate over time and limited the time window when diet shift was possible. Second, the hump-shaped relationship between size and foraging capacity resulted in growth reduction when growing out of the planktivorous niche. Switching to piscivory in our model occurred along a perpendicular relationship between fish prey and zooplankton density. Zooplankton density determined whether pikeperch reached a size advantage over prey, and fish prey density affected whether the foraging return of piscivory was higher than planktivory. Individuals not reaching a size advantage over prey and failing to become piscivorous were stunted at a size when consumption balanced metabolic requirements. Piscivorous individuals, however, continued to grow fast throughout the season by feeding on the wave of the prey cohort. Our results highlight the importance for predators that shift diet to be synchronized with fluctuations in resource availability, such as the pulses of new cohorts of prey fish.","Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, S-22362 Lund, Sweden","Persson, A (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, Ecol Bldg, S-22362 Lund, Sweden.",anders.persson@limnol.lu.se,,,,,,38,52,53,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2002,83,11,,,,,3014,3022,,,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,622AT,WOS:000179624600010,,,,,2021-09-27,

In this review, we synthesize the current knowledge of the invasion mechanisms and ecological impacts of Gracilaria vermiculophylla, a red agarophyte native to Asia Northwest Pacific, which now has become a rapid and successful coastal invader in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Oceans. Eco-physiological and chemical studies have revealed that some ecological traits, including survival in dark condition (e.g. the ballast water), tolerance to grazing and extreme salinities and temperatures, insensitive to UVR and light intensity and nutrient levels, adaptation to a wide diversity of habitats, and chemical defense to potential predators, may provide G. vermiculophylla an unmatched advantage during its global invasion. The rapid growth, flexible reproduction through fragmentation, efficient recruitment on hard substratum, seeding success on various vectors, and interaction with local community organisms may also contribute to its rapid increase in abundance and effects on the invaded coastal ecosystems. G. vermiculophylla showed both negative and positive impacts to the marine ecosystems through changing interspecific competition, increasing habitat diversity, altering the community complex, and transforming biogeochemical cycles and estuarine food webs. Future surveys such as marine exotic genomics, transcriptome sequencing and epigenetic variation between native and invasive entities may provide insightful promise on molecular mechanisms of seaweed invasion.","[Hu, Zi-Min] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Hu, Zi-Min; Juan, Lopez-Bautista] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Hu, ZM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.",huzimin9712@163.com,"Hu, Zi-Min/A-7938-2011","Hu, Zi-Min/0000-0002-1313-1785","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31000103]; US National Science Foundation Assembling the Tree of Life ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1036495, DEB-0937978]","We thank everyone who shared with us observations from both experimental and field surveys.

Recent age structured assessment modeling with covariate analysis indicates that the population dynamics of the sound's herring are influenced by oceanic factors, nutrition, and, most substantially, hatchery releases of juvenile pink salmon. For the 1993 decline, poor nutrition remains the most probable cause with disease a secondary response. Concerning poor recovery, we examined 16 potential factors and found three to be causal: oceanic factors, poor nutrition, and hatchery releases of juvenile pink salmon. Absences of strong year classes at both Sitka and Prince William Sound after 1993 indicate the action of large-scale ocean processes. Beyond regional-scale environmental factors, two factors specific to the sound influence the population dynamics of herring and are likely impeding recovery. First, pink salmon fry releases have increased to about 600 million annually and may disrupt feeding in young herring, which require adequate nutrition for growth and overwintering survival. Juvenile pink salmon and age-1 herring co-occur in nearshore areas of bays in late spring and summer, and available data on dietary overlap indicates potential competition between the age-1 juvenile herring and juvenile pink salmon. Field studies demonstrate that juvenile herring reduce food intake substantially in the presence of juvenile pink salmon. Second, overwintering humpback whales may consume potentially large amounts of adult herring, but further studies must confirm to what extent whale predation reduces herring biomass.","[Pearson, Walter H.] Peapod Res, Allendale, MI 49401 USA; [Deriso, Richard B.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Interamer Trop Tuna Commiss IATTC, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Elston, Ralph A.] AquaTechnics Inc, Carlsborg, WA 98324 USA; [Hook, Sharon E.; Anderson, Jack W.] Battelle Marine Sci Lab, Sequim, WA 98382 USA; [Parker, Keith R.] Data Anal Grp, Cloverdale, CA 95425 USA","Pearson, WH (corresponding author), Peapod Res, 7335 Watermark Dr, Allendale, MI 49401 USA.",waltpearson@peapodresearch.com,"Hook, Sharon/D-9067-2011","Hook, Sharon/0000-0002-0426-851X",Exxon Mobil CorporationExxon Mobil Corporation,"We thank Michael Anderson, Michael Cobb, Lee Miller, Ann Skillman, Kathryn Sobocinski, and John Southard of Battelle Marine Sciences Laboratory in Sequim, Washington, and Karen Humphrey of Aquatechnics, for their dedicated efforts in compiling and presenting the information in this review.

The most widely accepted hypothesis states that at smaller scales (such as patch scale), interspecific interactions are the major drivers structuring communities, whereas at larger regional scales, factors such as climate, topography and soil act as ecological filters that determine assemblage composition. The general aim of this-paper is to compare different exogenous drivers in terms of their relative dominance in structuring desert small mammal communities across a range of spatial scales, from patch to regional, and compare them with previous results on endogenous drivers. Our results show that as spatial scale increases, the explanatory power of exogenous factors also increases, e.g. from 17% at the patch scale (i.e. abundance) to 99% at the regional scale (i.e. diversity). Moreover, environmental drivers vary in type and strength depending on the community estimator across several spatial scales. On the other hand, endogenous drivers such as interspecific interactions are more important at the patch scale, diminishing in importance towards the regional scale. Therefore, the relative importance of exogenous versus endogenous drivers affects small mammal assemblage structure at different spatial scales. Our results fill up a knowledge gap concerning ecological drivers of assemblage structure at intermediate spatial scales for Monte desert small mammals, and highlight the importance of dealing with multi-causal factors in explaining ecological patterns of assemblages.

Here, we explore how predator diversity shapes parasite transmission. In a mesocosm experiment that manipulated predator (larval dragonflies and damselflies) density and diversity, non-intraguild (non-IG) predators that only consume free-living cercariae (parasitic trematodes) reduced metacercarial infections in tadpoles, whereas intraguild (IG) predators that consume both parasites and tadpole hosts did not. This likely occurred because IG predators reduced tadpole densities and anticercarial behaviors, increasing per capita exposure rates of the surviving tadpoles (i. e., via density-and trait-mediated effects) despite the consumption of parasites. A mathematical model demonstrated that non-IG predators reduce macroparasite infections, but IG predation weakens this dilution effect and can even amplify parasite burdens. Consistent with the experiment and model, a wetland survey revealed that the diversity of IG predators was unrelated to metacercarial burdens in amphibians, but the diversity of non-IG predators was negatively correlated with infections. These results are strikingly similar to generalities that have emerged from the predator diversity-pest biocontrol literature, suggesting that there may be general mechanisms for pest control and that biocontrol research might inform disease management and vice versa. In summary, we identified a general trait of predators-where they fall on an IG predation continuum-that predicts their ability to reduce infections and possibly pests in general. Consequently, managing assemblages of predators represents an underused tool for the management of human and wildlife diseases and pest populations.","[Rohr, Jason R.; Civitello, David J.; Halstead, Neal T.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Crumrine, Patrick W.] Rowan Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Glassboro, NJ 08028 USA; [Crumrine, Patrick W.] Rowan Univ, Dept Geog, Glassboro, NJ 08028 USA; [Crumrine, Patrick W.] Rowan Univ, Dept Environm, Glassboro, NJ 08028 USA; [Miller, Andrew D.] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Geog & Environm Syst, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; [Schotthoefer, Anna M.] Marshfield Clin Res Fdn, Marshfield, WI 54449 USA; [Stenoien, Carl] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Johnson, Lucinda B.] Univ Minnesota, Nat Resources Res Inst, Duluth, MN 55811 USA; [Beasley, Val R.] Penn State Univ, Dept Vet & Biomed Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Rohr, JR (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",jasonrohr@gmail.com,"Crumrine, Patrick W/I-7975-2016; Rohr, Jason R./AAJ-5856-2021","Crumrine, Patrick W/0000-0002-5752-8231; ","US Department of AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NRI 2008-00622 20, 2008-01785]; US Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [STAR R83-3835, CAREER 83518801, STAR R825867]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM109499]; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0516227, EF-1241889]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0516227]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1241889] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Biological InfrastructureNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1156796] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [F32AI112255] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM109499] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank M.

Here, we measured how both parental and offspring performance varied in nest sites distributed along an environmental gradient. The plainfin midshipman fish Porichthys notatus nests along a tidal gradient. When ascending from the subtidal to the high intertidal at low tide, both nest temperature and frequency of air exposure increase. We used one lab and two field experiments to investigate how parental nest site choices across tidal elevations are linked to the physiological costs incurred by parents and the developmental benefits accrued by offspring. Under warmer incubation conditions, simulating high intertidal nests, offspring developed faster but had higher mortality rates compared to those incubated in cooler conditions that mimicked subtidal nests. In the field, males in higher intertidal nests were more active caregivers, but their young still died at the fastest rates. Larger males claimed and retained low intertidal nests, where offspring survival and development rates were also highest. Our results suggest that males compete more intensively for nest sites in the low intertidal, where they can raise their young quickly and with lower per-offspring investments. Smaller, less-competitive males forced into higher intertidal sites nest earlier in the season and provide more active parental care, possibly to bolster brood survival under harsh environmental conditions.","[Brown, Nicholas A.

Larvae of the caddisfly Psilotreta kisoensis build portable cases from sedimentary sands and often display cannibalism. For this species, the availability of preferable case material is a critical factor that affects larval fitness, and material is locally variable depending on the underlying geology. In this study, we investigated how sand quality as a case material determines cannibalism frequency among larvae and, in turn, how the differential cannibalism frequency affects the body-size distribution and voltinism. Rearing experiments within a cohort revealed that a bimodal size distribution developed regardless of material quality. However, as the preferable material became abundant, the proportion of larger to smaller individuals increased. Consecutive experiments suggested that smaller larvae were more frequently cannibalized by larger ones and excluded from the population when preferable smooth material was abundant. This frequent cannibalism resulted in a bimodal size distribution with a significantly higher proportion of larger compared to smaller individuals. The size-dependent cannibalism was significantly suppressed when the larvae were raised in an environment with a scarcity of the preferable case material. This is probably because larvae cannot enjoy the benefit of rapid growth by cannibalism due to the difficulties in enlarging their case. At low cannibalism the growth of smaller individuals was stunted, and this was probably due to risk of cannibalism by larger individuals. This growth reduction in small individuals led to a bimodal size-distribution but with a lower proportion of larger to smaller individuals compared to at high cannibalism. A field study in two streams showed a similar size distribution of larvae as was found in the rearing experiment. The bimodal ratio has consequences for life history, since a size-bimodal population causes a cohort splitting: only larvae that were fully grown at 1 year had a univoltine life cycle, whereas larvae with a stunted growth continued their larval life for another year (semivoltine). This study suggests that availability of preferable case building material is an important factor that affects cannibalism, which in turn affects larval population size structure and cohort splitting.","[Okano, Jun-ichi; Okuda, Noboru] Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga, Japan; [Okuda, Noboru] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kyoto, Japan","Okano, J (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Otsu, Shiga, Japan.",j.oj.o55222@gmail.com,,"Okano, Jun-ichi/0000-0002-1295-4114","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [12J01273, 26840146]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26840146] Funding Source: KAKEN","This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (12J01273, 26840146) to JIO.

Studying the chronology and average age at such color transitions can be an easy and noninvasive method to (a) estimate the age of infants whose dates of birth were not observed, and (b) detect interindividual differences in the pace of development for infants with known birth dates. Materials and Methods Using a combination of photographs and field observations from 73 infant chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) of known ages, we (a) scored the skin color of six different body parts from pink to gray, as well as the color of the fur from black to gray; (b) validated our method of age estimation using photographic and field observations on an independent subset of 22 infants with known date of birth; and (c) investigated ecological, social, and individual determinants of age-related variation in skin and fur color. Results Our results show that transitions in skin color can be used to age infant chacma baboons less than 7 months old with accuracy (median number of days between actual and estimated age = 10, range = 0-86). We also reveal that food availability during the mother's pregnancy, but not during lactation, affects infant color-for-age and therefore acts as a predictor of developmental pace. Discussion This study highlights the potential of monitoring within- and between-infant variation in color to estimate age when age is unknown, and developmental pace when age is known.","[Dezeure, Jules; Dagorrette, Julie; Huchard, Elise] Univ Montpellier, Inst Evolutionary Biol Montpellier ISEM, CNRS, IRD,EPHE, Montpellier, France; [Baniel, Alice] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anthropol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Carter, Alecia J.; Martina, Claudia] UCL, Dept Anthropol, London, England; [Cowlishaw, Guy; Martina, Claudia; Raby, Cassandra L.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England; [Marshall, Harry H.] Univ Roehampton, Dept Life Sci, Ctr Res Ecol Evolut & Behav, London, England; [Martina, Claudia] Univ Vienna, Dept Behav Biol, Vienna, Austria; [Raby, Cassandra L.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Integrat Biol, Biosci Bldg, Liverpool, Merseyside, England","Dezeure, J (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, Inst Evolut Sci Montpellier, CNRS, UMR 5554,IRD,EPHE, Pl Eugene Bataillon,Cc 065, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France.",jules.dezeure@etu.umontpellier.fr,"Raby, Cassandra/AAD-4095-2020; Marshall, Harry/D-4945-2014; Huchard, Elise/G-9072-2011","Raby, Cassandra/0000-0001-7065-0306; Dezeure, Jules/0000-0002-6415-2789; Marshall, Harry/0000-0003-2120-243X; Huchard, Elise/0000-0002-6944-449X; Carter, Alecia/0000-0001-5550-9312",Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR)European Commission [ANR ERS-17-CE02-0008]; ZSL Institute of Zoology's Tsaobis Baboon Project,"The authors are grateful to all Tsaobis Baboon Project volunteers (2005-19), and in particular to Anna Cryer, Remi Emeriau, Rachel Heaphy, and Vittoria Roatti for sharing their pictures.

To explore whether such priority effects are important in determining strain composition of populations of the cyanobacterium Microcystis, four Microcystis strains, isolated from a single lake and differing in functional traits, were grown during 4 weeks in the laboratory in all possible pairwise combinations, with the two strains either inoculated at the same time or with a time lag of 1 week, in the presence or absence of grazing Daphnia magna. The relative abundance of strains in the mixtures was assessed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and the growth rate of each strain in the mixtures was determined for the last 2 weeks of the experiment. We observed strong effects of inoculation order on the final population structure, and these effects were influenced by grazing Daphnia. The priority effects were strain-specific and occurred in two directions: some of the strains grew slower while others grew faster when inoculated second compared with when inoculated first. Our results indicate that priority effects may have a profound impact on strain composition of Microcystis populations.","[van Gremberghe, Ineke; Vanormelingen, Pieter; Van der Gucht, Katleen; Souffreau, Caroline; Vyverman, Wim] Univ Ghent, Lab Protistol & Aquat Ecol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [De Meester, Luc] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Lab Aquat Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium","van Gremberghe, I (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Lab Protistol & Aquat Ecol, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Ineke.vanGremberghe@UGent.be,"Dasseville, Renaat/B-3561-2010; De Meester, Luc/F-3832-2015","De Meester, Luc/0000-0001-5433-6843; Souffreau, Caroline/0000-0003-0997-9190",ESF EURODIVERSITY; Belgian project B-BLOOMS2,"We thank Jeroen Van Wichelen and Renaat Dasseville for sampling lake Leeuwenhof, Victor Chepurnov for isolating the Microcystis strains and Sofie D'hondt for the DGGE analyses.

We provide estimates of the seasonal population dynamics and energy consumption of waterbirds along the Kowie Estuary, South Africa. Ten census counts were conducted every month along the estuary from June 2013 to May 2014. Energy consumption and fresh-matter intake were calculated based on body-mass equations. Piscivorous birds dominated the waterbird assemblage during summer (up to 289 individuals), whereas non-migratory shorebirds were dominant at other times of the year. The total wet mass of prey items ingested by waterbirds ranged from 2.8 kg ha(-1) during winter to 8.5 kg ha(-1) during summer. The total energy consumption of waterbirds ranged from 12 543 kJ ha(-1) during June to 33 104 kJ ha(-1) during December. Shannon-Wiener diversity calculations revealed that the Kowie Estuary had a greater diversity of waterbirds than several other South African estuaries, but less diversity than many large European estuaries. Studies that incorporate census counts and energy consumption measures, although rudimentary, may provide valuable information on resource use by waterbirds in estuaries and may benefit conservation management schemes.","[Hean, Jeffrey W.; Craig, Adrian J.

Several lines of evidence, however, suggest that carrion resources are more extensively used by vertebrates than has been widely assumed: 1) a substantial number of animals die from causes other than predation and become available to scavengers, 2) a wide variety of vertebrate scavengers, rather than microbes or arthropods, consume most available carcasses, and 3) intense competition exists between vertebrate scavengers and decomposers, especially in warm climates. Although vultures are best adapted to use carrion, nearly all vertebrate predators are also scavengers to some extent. The costs and benefits associated with carrion use influences the evolution of scavenging behavior in vertebrates, resulting in a continuum of facultative scavengers that use carrion to varying degrees. The realized usage of carrion by a vertebrate species is influenced by the speed and efficiency with which it forages, its visual and olfactory abilities, and its capacity for detoxifying products of decomposition. A deeper understanding of carrion use by facultative scavengers will improve our knowledge of community and ecosystem processes, especially the flow of energy through food webs.","Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; Savannah River Ecol Lab, Aiken, SC 29802 USA; Utah State Univ, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA","DeVault, TL (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",tdevatdt@fhr.purdue.edu,,"DeVault, Travis/0000-0001-6413-1104",,,,96,358,379,1,176,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2003,102,2,,,,,225,234,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12378.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,704CA,WOS:000184319100001,,Green Submitted,,,2021-09-27,

Such potential for adaptive behavioral plasticity may increase population resilience in montane habitats, where many unique amphibian assemblages have suffered from salmonid introductions. Here we present data from three experiments assessing the effects of coexistence and long-term experience with native and introduced salmonid predators on behavioral responses of larvae from montane populations of the Iberian frog, Rana iberica. Further, we examine the potential costs imposed by natural and exotic predatory threats on larval growth and development. Larvae coexisting both syntopically and allotopically with salmonids reduced activity to avoid detectability. Interestingly, larval activity levels increased and larval responsiveness to predators decreased after long-term exposure to waterborne cues from predatory fish, likely due to habituation. Exposure to predator cues during development did not affect larval growth but altered the timing of metamorphosis by reducing larval period. Although growth is not directly compromised and individuals increase their short-term probabilities to survive with aquatic predators by reaching metamorphosis earlier, they might face the costs of predation-induced responses and developmental acceleration in later life stages.","[Polo-Cavia, Nuria] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol, Madrid, Spain; [Boyero, Luz] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Sci & Technol, Bilbao, Spain; [Boyero, Luz] Ikerbasque, Basque Fdn Sci, Bilbao, Spain; [Martin-Beyer, Barbara; Navazo, Tomas; Bosch, Jaime] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Madrid, Spain; [Bosch, Jaime] Parque Nacl Sierra Guadarrama, Ctr Invest Seguimiento & Evaluac, Rascafria, Spain; [Bosch, Jaime] Univ Oviedo, CSIC, PA, Unidad Mixta Invest Biodiversidad, Campus Mieres, Mieres, Spain","Polo-Cavia, N (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol, Madrid, Spain.",nuria.polo@uam.es,", Nuria/L-5372-2014","Bosch, Jaime/0000-0002-0099-7934",,,,93,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-3547,1573-1464,,BIOL INVASIONS,Biol.

Amblyseius largoensis is considered a generalist due to its ability to feed on multiple food sources (e.g. phytophagous mites, small insects, plant exudates, nectar, and pollen). Specimens of A. largoensis sometimes attack each other in competitive situations. Thus, we hypothesized that intraspecific interactions, such as cannibalism, may occur when heterospecific prey are scarce. Experiments were conducted to determine whether, and to what extent, the availability of heterospecific prey, eggs of R. indica, influenced the tendencies of A. largoensis to cannibalise. Additionally, the oviposition of A. largoensis was measured in the presence and absence of both conspecific nymphs and R. indica eggs. Overall, in the absence of the heterospecific prey, A. largoensis consumed conspecific nymphs, and few eggs were produced, whereas in the presence of abundant herbivorous prey, cannibalism decreased, and oviposition increased. These results suggest that, similar to other phytoseiid mites, A. largoensis employs cannibalism as an adaptive survival strategy when heterospecific prey is absent or scarce.","[Mendes, Jairo A.; Barros, Maria E.

It has been suggested that reduced survival of farmed salmon offspring in the wild could, in part, be explained by increased susceptibility to predation through altered behaviour. This has however, not been demonstrated. This study investigated if farmed salmon display a higher susceptibility to predation than wild salmon, by exposing fry of farmed, hybrid and wild origin to an artificial predator in a semi-natural environment with competition for feed. The main results can be summarised as: (i) susceptibility to predation was similar in salmon of all origins, i.e., an equal number of farmed, hybrid and wild salmon were caught by the artificial predator; (ii) susceptibility to the artificial predator was not size-selective, i.e., large, fast growing individuals were caught in the same frequencies as small, slow growing individuals. As salmon fry of all origins were caught by the artificial predator in similar frequencies, equal susceptibility to predation was detected in farmed and wild salmon, under these conditions. If farmed salmon exhibit a genetically higher susceptibility to predation than wild salmon, potentially through increased risk-taking behaviour, this still remains to be demonstrated.

Predator and parasitoid interactions within the aphidophagous guild are likely to be very important in influencing the choices made by predatory hoverfly females. In the present study, the foraging and oviposition behavior of the aphidophagous hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus DeGeer (Diptera: Syrphidae) was investigated with respect to the parasitized state of its aphid prey, Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Homoptera: Aphididae), that were parasitized by Aphidius ervi Haliday (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae). We also recorded the number of eggs laid by hoverfly females when subjected to parasitized aphids. Furthermore, we studied the influence of being fed with parasitized aphids on hoverfly larval performance. Hoverfly females did not exhibit any preference for plants infested with unparasitized or aphids parasitized for 7 days. On the other hand, plants infested with mummies or exuvia were less attractive for E. balteatus. These results were correlated with (i) the number of eggs laid by E. balteatus females and (ii) larval performance. Thus, our results demonstrate that E. balteatus behavior is affected by parasitoid presence through their exploitation of aphid colonies. Indeed, hoverfly predators select their prey according to the developmental state of the parasitoid larvae.","[Almohamad, Raki; Verheggen, Francois J.; Francis, Frederic; Haubruge, Eric] Gembloux Agr Univ, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Entomol, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; [Hance, Thierry] Catholic Univ Louvain, Ecol & Biogeog Unit, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium","Verheggen, FJ (corresponding author), Gembloux Agr Univ, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Entomol, Passage Deportes 2, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium.",entomologie@fsagx.ac.be,,"Haubruge, Eric/0000-0002-8138-0476; Verheggen, Francois/0000-0002-5849-1661",,,,53,26,27,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-8703,1570-7458,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

Accordingly, changes in potential feeding time may predict the direction and magnitude of differences between elevations in individual growth rates of sessile marine invertebrates. Oysters (triploid Crassostrea ariakensis) experimentally introduced at intertidal (MLW+0.05 m) and subtidal (MLW-0.25 m) elevations in racks provided a test of the ability to use duration of water coverage to predict changes in growth. During early-to-mid winter, a depression of 38-47% in shell growth of intertidal oysters matched the 36% reduction in available feeding time relative to subtidal oysters. In late winter as solar heating of exposed oysters increased, growth differences of 52-55% departed only slightly from the predicted 39%. In spring, however, duration of water coverage failed to predict even the correct direction of growth change with elevation as intertidal oysters grew 34% faster despite 39% less feeding time. Intense seasonal development of shell fouling by other suspension feeders like ascidians, mussels, and barnacles on subtidal (94% incidence) but not on aerially exposed intertidal (21-38% incidence) oysters may explain why duration of water cover failed to predict spring growth differences. Less intense fouling develops on intertidal oysters due to the physiological stress of aerial exposure on settlers, especially during higher temperatures and longer solar exposures of spring. Fouling by suspension feeders is known to reduce growth of the host through localized competition for food and added energetic costs. Thus, in springtime, indirect effects of aerial exposure providing a partial refuge from biological enemies overwhelmed direct effects of reduced duration of water coverage to reverse the expected pattern of slower intertidal growth of a marine invertebrate.","Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA","Bishop, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, Gore Hill, NSW 2065, Australia.",Melanie.Bishop-1@uts.edu.au,,"Bishop, Melanie/0000-0001-8210-6500",,,,34,30,31,0,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2006,147,3,,,,,426,433,,10.1007/s00442-005-0273-3,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,017PT,WOS:000235706200005,16249896,,,,2021-09-27,

They were fed both natural resources and natural food enriched with a culture of the colourless Chilomonas (ovoid cell, 8 x 25 mu m). Four H.F. morphotypes occurred in the natural water and the first experiments with Daphnia, showed that the cladoceran would most easily ingest those of 5 mu m-10 mu m, while the addition of Chilomonas severely depressed the H.F. of 2 mu m. The capability of this flagellate to ingest small H.F. was confirmed using fluorescent particles ranging from 0.94 to 3.95 mu m. As a consequence, Daphnia could control the abundance of H.F., but also compete with the largest morphotypes. To study the influence of the H.F. on the life span of Daphnia, the cladoceran was acclimated for two generations, before the start of the experiments. In semi-natural conditions, constant temperature, without predators and fed natural water, the summer daphnids achieved smaller sizes, produced fewer offspring and lived for a shorter time than when Chilomonas was added to their diet. Despite the addition of 560 mu g C l(-1), this was not sufficient to enhance the Daphnia reproduction to the level of the spring population fed natural water. These results clearly illustrate that the heterotrophic flagellates contributed significantly to improving the reproduction and survival of the daphnids. They emphasise the importance of the microbial loop as a link to larger consumers, particularly when unpalatable or nutritionally inadequate algae are dominant, which is often so in lakes during summer.","Univ Clermont Ferrand, UPRES A 6042, Equipe Hydrosyst & Bassins Versants, F-63170 Clermont Ferrand, France","Lair, N (corresponding author), Univ Clermont Ferrand, UPRES A 6042, Equipe Hydrosyst & Bassins Versants, F-63170 Clermont Ferrand, France.",,,,,,,53,3,3,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JUN,2000,429,1-3,,,,,79,87,,10.1023/A:1004072513575,,,9,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,341JY,WOS:000088588300007,,,,,2021-09-27,

Although adult salamanders are not vulnerable to fish, larvae are extremely vulnerable; natural selection should favor adult oviposition behavior that minimizes contact between hatchling larvae and predators. In 1987, stream pools without fish had significantly higher densities of salamander eggs than did pools with fish. Between 1987 and 1988, fish in our study pools were killed by stream drying; this created a natural experiment addressing the effects of fish presence on adult oviposition behavior. In 1988, the new fishless pools had significantly more eggs in them than they had in 1987 when they contained fish. In contrast, a comparison of 1987 fishless pools with these same pools in 1988 did not show a similar increase in egg densities. Complete stream surveys in 1987 and 1988 indicated that fishless pools contained significantly greater densities of eggs and egg masses than did riffles or runs. Thus, pools without fish appear to be the preferred stream habitat for adult salamander oviposition. Competition for oviposition sites (rocks) did not appear to influence any of the comparisons. Because eggs are deposited such that fish cannot feed on them, our field surveys of egg masses suggest that selective oviposition by female streamside salamanders facilitates streamwide fish-salamander coexistence.","UNIV KENTUCKY,TH MORGAN SCH BIOL SCI,BEHAV & EVOLUTIONARY ECOL RES GRP,LEXINGTON,KY 40506",,,"Sih, Andrew/P-7985-2015","Sih, Andrew/0000-0001-6161-1663",,,,31,91,94,0,23,AMER SOC ICHTHYOLOGISTS HERPETOLOGISTS BUSINESS OFFICE,CARBONDALE,"SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIV, DEPT ZOOLOGY, CARBONDALE, IL 62901-6501",0045-8511,,,COPEIA,Copeia,MAY 1,1992,,2,,,,,468,473,,10.2307/1446206,,,6,Zoology,Zoology,HT728,WOS:A1992HT72800018,,,,,2021-09-27,

We examined the phenology of pond-breeding amphibians in central Missouri oak-hickory forests. Two ponds were monitored for 4 y from 2000-2003 and five other ponds were monitored for 1 y during 2004 using drift fences with pitfall traps. We found 15 species of pond-breeding amphibians, nine of which we captured in sufficient abundance to evaluate breeding phenology. Among the nine species, breeding migrations occur from Feb. to Nov., while subsequent metamorph emigration occurred primarily from May to Oct.. Our ponds were nearly permanent, resulting in salamander-dominated communities in these oak-hickory forests. Pond-use was partitioned by species that differed in their timing of reproduction and post-metamorphic emergence. For example, breeding in the fall gives larval ringed salamanders a potential size advantage over the spring-breeding spotted salamander larvae. However, the fall breeding strategy requires ponds with long hydroperiods that hold water continuously from Aug. through May. Green frogs and central newts also required long hydroperiods for their larval stage (> 160 d). American toads, however, are adapted to exploit ponds with shorter, less predictable hydroperiods as they only required ponds to hold water for as little as 60 d. Management for Multiple species of pond-breeding amphibians in a landscape benefits from the inclusion of wetlands with a variety of hydroperiods.","[Hocking, Daniel J.; Rittenhouse, Tracy A.

This work aims primarily on effects of intraspecific interactions. Agonistic and unequally strong interactions among conspecifics should make the within-population distribution of individuals to be characterised by spatial avoidance of potentially risky conspecifics, according to the individual risks perceived. This process should affect individual performance and involve individual tradeoffs, as failing to adequately avoid risky conspecifics could incur unnecessary costs, while, at the same time, successful conspecific avoidance may reduce access to patches favourable for e.g. foraging or sheltering. Intraspecific agonistic behaviours, such as cannibalism and competition, are likely to have prominent effects in size-structured populations. It is therefore reasonable to assume spatial avoidance of intraspecific risks according to individuals' size relationships in such populations. With this field investigation I show that individuals of northern pike spatially avoid larger conspecifics. This avoidance creates a size-influenced and spatially clumped distribution pattern among pike individuals. At low pike densities, however, distances between individuals increase, allowing for an even distribution pattern to appear. The spatial distribution patterns among piscivore individuals should affect both the individual performance of predators and the potential for spatial antipredatory responses of their prey, and hence be a factor in consumer-resource interactions.","Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden","Nilsson, PA (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",anders.nilssson@limnol.lu.se,"Nilsson, Anders/H-6836-2014","Nilsson, Anders/0000-0002-3541-9835",,,,38,44,44,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,2006,113,2,,,,,251,258,,,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,044EO,WOS:000237655400006,,,,,2021-09-27,

We additionally determined biases (underestimation or overestimation of rates) resulting from each method. We used modeling to evaluate what characteristics of clusters best predicted a kill versus no kill and further evaluated which predictor(s) minimized effort and the number of missed kills. We conducted 16 VHF ground predation sequences resulting in 37 kill intervals (KIs) and 21 GPS sequences resulting in 84 KIs on 6 solitary adult females, 4 maternal females, and 5 adult males. Kill rates (days/kill and biomass [kg] killed/day) did not differ between VHF and GPS predation sampling methods for maternal females, solitary adult females, and adult males. Sixteen of 142 (11.3%) kills detected via GPS clusters were missed through VHF ground-based sampling, and the kill rate was underestimated by an average of 5.2 (95% CI = 3.8-6.6) days/kill over all cougar social classes. Five of 142 (3.5%) kills identified by GPS cluster sampling were incorrectly identified as the focal individual's kill from scavenging, and the kill rate was overestimated within the adult male social class by an average of 5.8 (95% CI = 3.0-8.5) days/ungulate kill. The number of nights (locations between 2000 hours and 0500 hours) a cougar spent at a cluster was the most efficient variable at predicting predation, minimizing the missed kills, and minimizing number of extra clusters that needed to be searched. In Yellowstone National Park, where competing carnivores displaced cougars from their kills, it was necessary to search extra sites where a kill may not have been present to ensure we did not miss small, ungulate prey kills or kills with displacement. Using predictions from models to assign unvisited clusters as no kill, small prey kill, or large prey kill can bias downward the number of kills a cougar made and bias upward kills made by competitors that displace cougars or scavenge cougar kills. Our findings emphasize that field visitation is crucial in determining displacement and scavenging events that can result in biases when using GPS cluster methods in multicarnivore systems.","[Ruth, Toni K.; Buotte, Polly C.] Hornocker Wildlife Inst, Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA; [Quigley, Howard B.] Craighead Beringia S, Kelly, WY 83011 USA; [Quigley, Howard B.] Panthera, Bozeman, MT 59719 USA","Ruth, TK (corresponding author), Selway Inst, POB 929,40 Heronwood Lane, Bellevue, ID 83313 USA.",truth@centurytel.net,,,Richard King Mellon Foundation; Laura Moore Cunningham Foundation; Charles Engelhard Foundation; Michael Cline Foundation; Argosy Foundation; Summerlee Foundation; Tim and Karen Hixon Foundation; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society; M. and A.

Such competition can be minimized through niche dimensions: mechanism of resource partitioning based on prey choice and foraging tactic. This study compared habitat use patterns of 5 top predators (bottlenose dolphins, double-crested cormorants, osprey, brown pelicans and terns) within Florida Bay with respect to each other, their prey and habitat variability. Foraging dolphins, osprey and pelicans exhibited similar habitat use patterns in shallow, turbid, productive waters with high proportions of mud and mudbank bottom types. These same habitat characteristics also described the distribution of their major prey items: mullet and catfish. Competition between these 3 predators is likely diluted by foraging tactic variation. Conversely, the habitat use patterns of cormorants showed strongest association with deeper water, with low chlorophyll a and turbidity levels, less mud and mudbank habitat, and greater proportions of hardbottom and seagrass bottoms. Those prey items of cormorants with less competition from other predators examined displayed the same habitat associations. Cormorants in Florida Bay may concentrate their foraging efforts on less competitive prey, occurring more frequently in habitats where these prey items dominate. Despite Florida Bay's limited bathymetric relief, habitat use patterns of top predators are significantly influenced by depth, and subsequently bottom type. Sighting rates of all predators, except non-foraging dolphins, peaked in shallow mudbank habitats. This pattern of strong habitat overlap among predators implies currently adequate resource availability and/or niche dimensions among interspecific competitors.","[Torres, Leigh G.] Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA","Torres, LG (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res NIWA, 301 Evans Bay Parade,Greta Point,Private Bag 14-9, Wellington 6021, New Zealand.",l.torres@niwa.co.nz,,,"Everglades National Park [EVER-2003-SCI-0042, EVER2004-SCI-0062, EVER-2005-SCI-0062]; Duke University Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC) [911-1466, 572-1639]; SERC-FIU; SFWMD/SERC [C-15397]; EPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [X994621-940]; Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission; NOAA/Coastal OceanNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Dolphin Ecology; Duke University Marine","This research was conducted under Everglades National Park permits EVER-2003-SCI-0042, EVER2004-SCI-0062, and EVER-2005-SCI-0062, General Authorizations 911-1466 and 572-1639, and approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC).

Considerable progress has been made in the development of effective methodologies to assess what resources are valued under controlled experimental conditions, but few of the findings from these studies have been implemented in commercial husbandry systems. A major obstacle has been the need to maintain internal validity in experimental studies at the possible expense of external validity. Experimental subjects may be poor representatives of commercially kept animals, especially where there is no replication of the animal's experience of commercial physical and social environments. This paper will discuss means of increasing the external validity of consumer demand studies. Firstly, experimental animals should be of representative genotypes, reared under commercial conditions and housed in test apparatus with free access to all of the resources that are normally available under commercial husbandry conditions. As well as providing a long-term closed economy, this allows manipulation of potentially important environmental factors such as prior experience. Secondly, naturalistic tasks should, where possible, be used in preference to abstract operant tasks since they appear to be easier to train animals to associate with rewarding resources, therefore many individuals can be investigated efficiently. Furthermore, naturalistic tasks appear to be less prone to operant bias than artificial tasks and can provide robust measures of value in terms of the maximum price paid for access to resources. Finally, for group-housed species, social costs such as enduring higher stocking densities and/or competition for resources may be an effective means of investigating cost-benefit trade-offs under commercial conditions. For example, if animals work to evenly distribute themselves over available space, this social spacing priority can be used to investigate whether they will endure higher stocking densities in order to exploit particular resources.","Lincoln Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Anim Behav Cognit & Welf Grp, Lincoln LN2 2LG, England","Cooper, JJ (corresponding author), Lincoln Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Anim Behav Cognit & Welf Grp, Riseholme Pk, Lincoln LN2 2LG, England.",jcooper@lincoln.ac.uk,,,,,,85,18,18,0,18,UNIV FEDERATION ANIMAL WELFARE,WHEATHAMPSTEAD,"OLD SCHOOL, BREWHOUSE HILL, WHEATHAMPSTEAD AL4 8AN, HERTS, ENGLAND",0962-7286,,,ANIM WELFARE,Anim.

Previous research has shown that European beach grass Ammophila arenaria, an invasive species in coastal California, affects the predation of other seeds by the rodents Microtus californicus, Peromyscus maniculatus, and Reithrodontomys megalotis. This may be due to lower perceived predation risk by rodents foraging in close proximity to the cover provided by Ammophila, but this mechanism has not yet been tested. We examined the perceived predation risk of rodents by measuring the 'giving up density' of food left behind in experimental patches of food in areas with and without abundant cover from Ammophila and under varying amount of moonlight. We found strong evidence that giving up density was lower in the thick uniform vegetation on Ammophila-dominated habitat than it was in the more sparsely and diversely vegetated restored habitat. There was also evidence that moonlight affected giving up density and that it mediated the effects of habitat, although with our design we were unable to distinguish the effects of lunar illumination and moon phase. Our findings illustrate that foraging rodents, well known to be risk-averse during moonlit nights, are also affected by the presence of an invasive plant. This result has implications for granivory and perhaps plant demography in invaded and restored coastal habitats. Future research in this system should work to unravel the complex trophic links formed by a non-native invasive plant (i.e., Ammophila) providing cover favored by native rodents, which likely forage on and potentially limit the recruitment of native and non-native plants, some of which have ecosystem consequences of their own.","[Johnson, Matthew D.; De Leon, Yesenia L.] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Wildlife, Arcata, CA 95521 USA","Johnson, MD (corresponding author), Humboldt State Univ, Dept Wildlife, Arcata, CA 95521 USA.",matt.johnson@humboldt.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0934022]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0934022] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This study was made possible by funding from National Science Foundation (Undergraduate Research and Mentoring award #0934022) to Dr. Bruce O'Gara (PI) and Johnson (co-PI) at Humboldt State University.

Higher growth rates, for example, confer a major fitness advantage in larval and juvenile fishes, with larger fish undergoing significantly less mortality. The role of dietary resources in the size-structuring process has not been well validated, especially at the early post-settlement phase, where competition and predation are seen as preeminent drivers of juvenile fish assemblage structure. Here, we report on a size differential of 10-20% between recently settled Siganus spinus rabbitfish recruits from different bays around the Pacific island of Guam. This difference was maintained across multiple recruitment events within and between years. After confirming the validity of our observations through otolith increment analysis, subsequent investigation into the drivers of this variation revealed significant differences in the structure of algal assemblages between bays, congruent with the observed differences in size of the recently settled fish. Gut analyses showed a greater presence of algal types with higher levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in the stomachs of fish from Tanguisson, the bay with the largest observed recruits. To ensure this mechanism was one of causation and not correlation, we conducted a fully factorial experiment in which S. spinus recruits sampled from different bays were reared on all combinations of algal diets representative of the different bays. Recruits on the 'Tanguisson' diet grew faster than recruits on other diets, regardless of their origin. We propose that the greater availability of high-quality dietary resources at this location is likely conferring benefits that impact on the population-level dynamics of this species. The spatial and temporal extent of this process clearly implicates food as a limiting resource, capable of mediating fish population dynamics at multiple spatial scales and ontogenetic phases.","[Priest, Mark A.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Halford, Andrew R.] Bentley Delivery Ctr, Dept Parks & Wildlife, Locked Bag 104, Perth, WA 6983, Australia; [Clements, Kendall D.; Douglas, Emily] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Abellana, Sheena L.] Univ Guam, Marine Lab, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA; [McIlwain, Jennifer L.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA 6107, Australia; [Douglas, Emily] Univ Waikato, Sch Sci, Hamilton, New Zealand","Priest, MA (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",m.priest@uq.edu.au,"; McIlwain, Jennifer/J-9179-2012","Douglas, Emily/0000-0002-9728-6943; Clements, Kendall/0000-0001-8512-5977; McIlwain, Jennifer/0000-0002-7790-5081",US Fish and Wildlife's Federal Assistance in Sportfish Restoration Program Grant [W07-1600-005],"We thank A.

In four experimental 10 m by 10 m plots, macroalgae were greatly reduced (fleshy algal cover reduced by 84%) by scrubbing and shearing, while four similar plots acted as controls. The numerical abundance in all fish groups except wi asses and macroalgal-feeding parrotfishes (species in the genera Calotomus and Leptoscarus) increased in experimental algal reduction plots. Algal (Sargassum) and seagrass (Thalassia) assays, susceptible to scraping and excavating parrotfishes, were bitten more frequently in the algal reduction plots one month after the manipulation. Further, surgeonfish (Acanthurus leucosternon and A. nigrofuscus) foraging intensity increased in these algal reduction plots. The abundance of triggerfishes increased significantly in experimental plots relative to control plots, but densities remained low, and an index of sea urchin predation using tethered juvenile and adult Echinometra mathaei showed no differences between treatments following macroalgal reduction. Dominance of reefs by macro-fleshy algae appears to reduce the abundance of fishes, mostly herbivores and their rates of herbivory, but also other groups such as predators of invertebrates (triggerfishes, butterflyfishes and angelfishes).","Coral Reef Conservat Project, Wildlife Conservat Soc, Mombasa, Kenya; Newcastle Univ, Dept Marine Sci & Coastal Management, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; Fisheries Res Inst, Maputo, Mozambique","McClanaban, TR (corresponding author), Coral Reef Conservat Project, Wildlife Conservat Soc, POB 99470, Mombasa, Kenya.",crcp@africaonline.co.ke,,"McClanahan, Timothy/0000-0001-5821-3584; Polunin, Nick/0000-0002-1480-8794",,,,58,50,52,0,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0722-4028,1432-0975,,CORAL REEFS,Coral Reefs,SEP,1999,18,3,,,,,195,203,,10.1007/s003380050181,,,9,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,241WH,WOS:000082906500001,,,,,2021-09-27,

To perform artificial selection, the phenotypic trait of interest is measured on a population, and the individuals with the most extreme phenotypic values are bred to produce the next generation. The change in the mean of the selected trait across each generation is the response to selection, and other traits can also evolve due to genetic correlations with the selected trait. Artificial selection can directly answer the question of how quickly a trait will evolve under a given strength of selection. This kind of result can help ecologists determine whether range or niche boundaries are determined by a lack of variation for a key phenotypic trait or trade-offs due to genetic correlations with other fitness-related traits. In a related approach, controlled natural selection, the organisms are not selected according to their values for a given trait, but rather are allowed to evolve for one to several generations under experimentally imposed environmental treatments such as temperature, light, nutrients, presence or absence of predators or competitors, etc. The results of this kind of study can tell us how quickly a population can adapt to a given environmental change, either natural or anthropogenic. Finally, artificial selection can create more variation for measurements of natural Selection or can be coupled with QTL mapping; both these combinations provide new. insights into adaptation. I discuss advantages and disadvantages of these approaches relative to other kinds of studies and highlight case studies showing how these tools can answer a,wide range of basic and applied questions in ecology, ranging from niche and range boundaries and character displacement to climate change and invasive species.","Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA","Conner, JK (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, 3700 E Gull Lake Dr, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA.",Connerj@msu.edu,"Conner, Jeffrey/F-3188-2011","Conner, Jeffrey/0000-0003-1613-5826",,,,55,112,113,5,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JUL,2003,84,7,,,,,1650,1660,,10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1650:ASAPTF]2.0.CO;2,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,713DN,WOS:000184840900002,,,,,2021-09-27,

The results obtained by all three methods consistently showed that Phaeocystis globosa is not an adequate food source for the spring copepods in the Belgian coastal zone. Our results demonstrated that, among the potential prey, copepods strongly selected diatoms and microzooplankton, and that these types of prey accounted for the major part of the ingested carbon. However, diatoms and microzooplankton ingestion did not always seem sufficient in terms of carbon to avoid food limitation. Comparison of clearance rates exerted on different potential prey types during the P. globosa peak with those before and after the P. globosa peak showed that the copepods' feeding pressure on diatoms was reduced during the P. globasa peak while that on microzooplankton was not. The low grazing pressure on P. globosa, together with the preferential grazing on diatoms, which reduces the competition for nutrients, and the predation on microzooplankton organisms, which reduces the microzooplankton grazing pressure on P. globosa cells, are likely to favour the P. globosa bloom in the Southern Eight of the North Sea.

Mating behaviors are hormonally regulated and may be sexually selected traits: courtship displays are selected via mate choice, while forced copulations and aggressive behaviors are selected for via intrasexual competition. Endocrine disrupting compounds interfere with proper hormonal functioning in exposed animals. Exposures during developmentally crucial life stages can have irreversible effects lasting through adulthood. I tested the effects of prenatal exposure to environmentally relevant doses of a commonly used herbicide, atrazine (1 and 13.5 mu g/L) on mating behaviors in male guppies. Guppies were used as a model organism to test the effects of atrazine exposure on wildlife reproductive health. Adult female guppies were mated and exposed to the treatments throughout the gestation period, and offspring born to them were raised without further treatment. At adulthood, the males were tested for the effects of prenatal exposure on their mating behaviors such as courtship displays, gonopodium swings, forced copulatory attempts, and competitive and aggressive behaviors towards rivals who were not exposed to atrazine. I also tested female preference for treated males compared to control males. Atrazine-exposed males were less likely to perform the mating behaviors, and performed them less frequently, than control males. Atrazine exposure also made males less aggressive towards rivals. Females preferred untreated males over atrazine-treated males. In all cases, a non-monotonic pattern was seen, highlighting the significance of low-dose exposures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this study we investigated the natural variation in the amount and composition of bufadienolide toxins, and the relative importance of ecological factors in predicting that variation, in larvae of the common toad, Bufo bufo, an amphibian that produces toxins de novo. We found that tadpoles' toxin content varied markedly among populations, and the number of compounds per tadpole also differed between two geographical regions. The most consistent predictor of toxicity was the strength of competition, indicating that tadpoles produced more compounds and larger amounts of toxins when coexisting with more competitors. Additionally, tadpoles tended to contain larger concentrations of bufadienolides in ponds that were less prone to desiccation, suggesting that the costs of toxin production can only be afforded by tadpoles that do not need to drastically speed up their development. Interestingly, this trade-off was not alleviated by higher food abundance, as periphyton biomass had negligible effect on chemical defense. Even more surprisingly, we found no evidence that higher predation risk enhances chemical defenses, suggesting that low predictability of predation risk and high mortality cost of low toxicity might select for constitutive expression of chemical defense irrespective of the actual level of predation risk. Our findings highlight that the variation in chemical defense may be influenced by environmental heterogeneity in both the need for, and constraints on, toxicity as predicted by optimal defense theory.","[Bokony, Veronika; Gal, Zoltan; Kurali, Aniko; Miko, Zsanett; Pasztor, Katalin; Szederkenyi, Mark; Toth, Zoltan; Ujszegi, Janos; Ueveges, Balint; Hettyey, Attila] Hungarian Acad Sci, Agr Res Ctr, Inst Plant Protect, Lendulet Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, Herman Otto U 15, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary; [Moricz, Agnes M.; Kruzselyi, Daniel] Hungarian Acad Sci, Agr Res Ctr, Inst Plant Protect, Dept Pathophysiol, Herman Otto U 15, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary; [Toth, Zsofia] Univ Debrecen, Dept Evolutionary Zool & Human Biol, Egyet Ter 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Gal, Zoltan] NARIC, Agr Biotechnol Inst, Szentgyorgyi Albert U 4, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary; [Szederkenyi, Mark; Ueveges, Balint; Hoi, Herbert] Univ Vet Med, Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, Dept Integrat Biol & Evolut, Savoyenstr 1, A-1160 Vienna, Austria; [Capon, Robert J.] Univ Queensland, Inst Mol Biosci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia","Bokony, V (corresponding author), Hungarian Acad Sci, Agr Res Ctr, Inst Plant Protect, Lendulet Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, Herman Otto U 15, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary.",bokony.veronika@agrar.mta.hu,"Bokony, Veronika/AAH-7679-2020; Capon, Robert/G-9238-2012; Moricz, Agnes/E-2416-2018; Uveges, Balint/J-5607-2019","Bokony, Veronika/0000-0002-2136-5346; Capon, Robert/0000-0002-8341-7754; Uveges, Balint/0000-0001-9234-9258; Moricz, Agnes/0000-0002-4330-9396; Miko, Zsanett/0000-0003-4853-9331; Kruzselyi, Daniel/0000-0003-4749-7010; Toth, Zoltan/0000-0002-2634-8393; Hettyey, Attila/0000-0003-0678-0936; Toth, Zsofia/0000-0002-9893-6303","'Lendulet' programme of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA) [LP2012-24/2012]; FP7 Marie Curie Career Integration Grant [PCIG13-GA-2013-631722]; Sparkling Science Project of the Federal Ministry of Science and Research, Austria (BMWF) [SPA 04/171]; MTA postdoctoral research programme [SZ-029/2013]; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA)Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA) [PD108938]; Bolyai Fellowship of the Hungarian Academy of SciencesHungarian Academy of Sciences","We thank Kutyo L.

Recent changes in fishing effort have dramatically decreased tuna stocks, breaking this balance. Killer whales exhibit two strategies for feeding on tuna: active hunting and depredation on a drop-line fishery. From 1999 to 2011, a small community of 39 individuals was observed in the Strait in spring and summer. All individuals displayed active hunting and 18 of them also depredated on the fishery. These differences in foraging behaviour influenced life-history parameters. Adult survival for interacting and non-interacting individuals was estimated at 0.991 (SE = 0.011) and 0.901 (SE = 0.050), respectively. Juvenile survival could only be estimated for interacting individuals as 0.966 (SE = 0.024), because only one juvenile and one calf were observed among non-interacting individuals. None of the interacting calves survived after 2005, following the decrease in drop-line fishery catches. Calving rate was estimated at 0.22 (SE = 0.02) for interacting individuals and 0.02 (SE = 0.01) for non-interacting. Calving interval, which could only be calculated for interacting groups, was 7 years. The population growth rate was positive at 4% for interacting individuals, and no growth was observed for non-interacting individuals. These differences in demographic parameters could be explained by access to larger tuna through depredation. Consequently, we found that whales would need more tuna to cover their daily energy requirements while actively hunting. Therefore, our findings suggest an effect of artificial food provisioning on their survival and reproductive output. Urgent actions are needed to ensure the conservation of this, already small, community of killer whales. These include its declaration as Endangered, the implementation of a conservation plan, the creation of a seasonal management area where activities producing underwater noise (i.e. military exercise, seismic surveys or even whale watching activities) are forbidden from March to August, and the promotion of bluefin tuna conservation. Additionally, energetic requirements of this whale community should be taken into account when undertaking ecosystem-based fishery management for the Atlantic bluefin tuna stock. In the meantime, as marine predators are most sensitive to changes in fish abundance when prey abundance is low; we suggest an urgent short-term action. Artisanal fisheries, such as drop-lines, should be promoted instead of purse seiners in the Mediterranean Sea. This will help to maintain the survival and reproductive output of the whale community until showing clear signs of recovery and stability, and/or their prey stock recovers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that cumulative oyster spatfall on off-bottom collector plates, measured throughout the summer in 14 years over a span of three decades, was highly positively correlated (r(2) = 0.8) with juvenile oyster recruitment on adjacent oyster bars. Total abundances of juvenile oysters on these bars were, however, generally 99.7% lower than predicted from cumulative seasonal larval settlement on collector plates. We propose that although the number of larvae metamorphosing was the key factor in determining the gross annual pattern of recruitment to these mesohaline oyster bars, the actual magnitude of recruitment was governed by post-settlement processes, such as competition for limited resources and predation. We tested the hypothesis that predation may be partly responsible for high post-settlement juvenile oyster mortality. We performed a series of 3-d field investigations over two summers (1989, 1990) at a mesohaline site, employing cages of various mesh sizes (400, 800, 1500 mu m) to protect hatchery-reared spat of 0.5 to 4.0 mm shell height. Mortality rates for spat held for 3 d in the estuary (17.8%) were significantly higher (P = 0.0001) for the smallest spat (0.5 to 2.0 mm) compared with those of 2.01 to 4.0 mm (4.2%). In 1990, but not in 1989, enclosure within 400 and 800 mu m mesh cages significantly (P = 0.004) increased survival during 3-d deployments (9.4 and 10.1%, respectively) compared with spat unprotected by mesh cages (21.9%). In a series of laboratory predation studies that used the entire community of invertebrates that could penetrate the cages, microscopic juvenile polyclad flatworms, Stylochus ellipticus, were the only organisms that we observed crawling into living oysters and feeding on oyster tissue. Large flatworms (50 to 200 mm(2)) are known to be important predators on oysters, but this ability of flatworms that were so small (< ca. 5 mm(2)) and translucent as to be almost invisible without magnification to feed on immediate post-metamorphic oysters has not been documented previously. Our results suggest that the rate of mortality due to predation in mesohaline Chesapeake Bay is much reduced once spat survive for 2 to 3 weeks post-metamorphosis. Thus, it is likely that predation in the 1 to 2 week period immediately after settlement may be a crucial factor in the structuring of eastern oyster populations.","Univ Maryland, Horn Point Environm Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA; Western Maryland Coll, Dept Biol, Westminster, MD 21157 USA; Univ Maryland, Maryland Sea Grant Coll, Ctr Environm Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Newell, RIE (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Horn Point Environm Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, POB 775, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA.",,"Kennedy, Victor S/D-5854-2012",,,,,50,50,51,0,10,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0025-3162,,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

It is believed that this problem results at least in part from difficulties of effectively integrating factors that act across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Here, as an aid to developing more robust modelling and sampling methodologies, a simple process-based model for local-scale dynamics of Atlantic salmon juveniles is developed from first principles by integrating contemporary understanding of self-thinning, density-dependent growth and dispersal. The aim is to present a readily understood structure to illustrate the links between spawning and stocking strategies, habitat, migration and fish production. Based on this structure, contemporary understanding of the more complex biological processes that affect density, growth and habitat are discussed in relation to some of the key requirements of managers, including stocking for rehabilitation, assessment of predation impact and development of strategies for sampling populations effectively when deriving habitat-production models. A major conclusion is that more structured, integrated research is required to provide the basic variables needed to model links between local and global scale habitat and fish production effectively. Nevertheless, application of the current understanding of the biology of Atlantic salmon should be of great benefit to managers in extracting key information from field surveys.

Although theory has demonstrated a variety of mechanisms by which predation and competition in food webs can indirectly control infection risk in hosts, there have until now been no experimental tests of this theory. We sampled the effect of long-term exclusion of large vertebrate herbivores on the prevalence of infection by a group of aphid-vectored viruses that infect grasses (barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses) in an oak savannah in central California. We found that pathogen prevalence was similar to 4-fold higher in the presence of consumers than in areas where they were excluded. Vertebrate consumers did not directly alter infection rates by this aphid-vectored pathogen group, but rather increased infection risk by increasing the relative abundance of highly-competent hosts in the grassland community. This large-scale experiment, measuring changes in host abundance and infection risk in response to altered consumption rates, confirms theoretical predictions that consumers can indirectly increase infection risk by altering the composition of whole communities. Most importantly, these results demonstrate that, even in complex natural communities, alterations to food web composition such as consumer invasion or extinction can lead to significant impacts that cascade throughout entire communities, including changes in infection risk.","[Borer, Elizabeth T.; Seabloom, Eric W.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Mitchell, Charles E.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Power, Alison G.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Borer, ET (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",borer@science.oregonstate.edu,"Mitchell, Charles E/I-3709-2014","Mitchell, Charles E/0000-0002-1633-1993; Seabloom, Eric/0000-0001-6780-9259; Borer, Elizabeth/0000-0003-2259-5853","National Science Foundation/National Institutes of Health Ecology of Infectious DiseasesNational Science Foundation (NSF) [05-25666, 05-25641, 0525669]; California Integrated Hardwood and Range Management Program","We thank B.

This indirect defense can cause ecological costs when herbivores themselves use VOCs as cues to localize suitable host plants. Can VOCs reliably indicate food plant quality to herbivores? Methodology: We determined the choice behavior of herbivorous beetles (Chrysomelidae: Gynandrobrotica guerreroensis and Cerotoma ruficornis) when facing lima bean plants (Fabaceae: Phaseolus lunatus) with different cyanogenic potential, which is an important constitutive direct defense. Expression of inducible indirect defenses was experimentally manipulated by jasmonic acid treatment at different concentrations. The long-distance responses of male and female beetles to the resulting induced plant volatiles were investigated in olfactometer and free-flight experiments and compared to the shortdistance decisions of the same beetles in feeding trials. Conclusion: Female beetles of both species were repelled by VOCs released from all induced plants independent of the level of induction. In contrast, male beetles were repelled by strongly induced plants, showed no significant differences in choice behavior towards moderately induced plants, but responded positively to VOCs released from little induced plants. Thus, beetle sex and plant VOCs had a significant effect on host searching behavior. By contrast, feeding behavior of both sexes was strongly determined by the cyanogenic potential of leaves, although females again responded more sensitively than males. Apparently, VOCs mainly provide information to these beetles that are not directly related to food quality. Being induced by herbivory and involved in indirect plant defense, such VOCs might indicate the presence of competitors and predators to herbivores. We conclude that plant quality as a food source and finding a potentially enemy-free space is more important for female than for male insect herbivores, whereas the presence of a slightly damaged plant can help males to localize putative mating partners.","[Ballhorn, Daniel J.; Kautz, Stefanie; Heil, Martin] Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Bot Plant Ecol, Essen, Germany","Ballhorn, DJ (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Dept Biol, Portland, OR 97207 USA.",ballhorn@pdx.edu,"Heil, Martin/I-1797-2012; Heil, Martin/T-3960-2019","Heil, Martin/0000-0001-8036-8697","German Science Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [He 3169/4-2, Ba 3966/1-1]; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina [LPDS 2009-29]","This work was supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) (:http://www.dfg.de/foerderung/index.html), grant numbers He 3169/4-2 and Ba 3966/1-1.

In Idaho, USA, following intensive hunting to reduce crop depredations in the late 1980s, pronghorn populations have not rebounded to desired levels. Because neonatal survival in ungulates is one factor limiting population growth, we evaluated cause-specific mortality and the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on survival rates of 217 radio-collared pronghorn fawns across 3 study areas in Idaho during 2015-2016. For intrinsic variables, we determined the sex and body mass index (BMI) for each fawn. For extrinsic variables, we determined the abundance of predators and alternate prey, estimated the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for 1 month pre- and post-parturition, and measured fecal nitrogen and diaminopimelic acid (DAPA). We considered NDVI as a measure of plant productivity, and fecal nitrogen and DAPA as possible proxies of diet quality. We predicted NDVI, fecal nitrogen, and DAPA would be positively related to the nutritional status of females and positively related to fawn survival. We used Program MARK with known fate models to estimate semi-monthly survival rates of pronghorn fawns for the first 4 months post-parturition. During both years, the leading cause of fawn mortality was coyote (Canis latrans) predation (58%), followed by unknown causes of mortality (18%), unknown predation (12%), predation by bobcats (Lynx rufus; 6%), predation by golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos; 3%), and other (3%). Mean fawn survival for the 4 months post-parturition across years and study sites was 0.42 +/- 0.04 (SE; range = 28-62%). The top survival model included BMI, lagomorph abundance, and DAPA and had a model weight of 83.3%. All 3 variables were positively related to pronghorn fawn survival. Because females with increased nutrition generally have heavier fawns, BMI was likely correlated to diet quality, which was supported by the positive relationship between DAPA and fawn survival. We hypothesize that high lagomorph abundance created an alternate prey base to buffer coyotes from preying on pronghorn neonates. We found no influence of measures of NDVI (pre- and post-parturition), fecal nitrogen, or predator abundance on fawn survival. Management actions providing high-quality forage for pronghorn are likely to contribute to production of heavier fawns having the highest chance of survival.

Although there is experimental support for intrasexual selection ( male-male competition) having shaped the males' EOD pulse duration in evolution, nothing is known about intersexual selection, such as female choice. Playback of 25 natural male EODs of pulse duration varying from 320 mu s ( close to the average female value) to 716 mu s, to eight female experimental subjects elicited approach, head butts and circling behaviour. The rate of head butts on the dipole electrode model increased significantly with stimulus pulse duration in seven out of eight experimental subjects. In ten experimental female subjects we contrasted the shortest playback pulse with simultaneous playback of one of four longer ones ( 424, 524, 628 and 716 mu s). Pooled responses for all experimental subjects were stronger for the dipole playing back the longer pulse in a pulse pair. The difference in the number of head butts ( Delta head butts) that were dealt the two dipoles per 60 s test session increased significantly with the difference in pulse duration ( Delta pulse duration). The increase followed a significant linear trend ( P<0.0001). Similar results were obtained for Delta association time, Delta circles with head butts, and Delta circles without head butts. These results suggest that a male's reproductive success is enhanced by longer, i.e. more attractive EODs, and that both intra- and intersexual selection must have played a significant role in shaping the EOD of male M. pongolensis.","[Machnik, Peter; Kramer, Bernd] Univ Regensburg, Inst Zool, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany","Kramer, B (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Inst Zool, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany.",Bernd.Kramer@biologie.uni-regensburg.de,,"Machnik, Peter/0000-0002-4991-2137",,,,47,25,25,0,7,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

This fact is in no way, however, reflected in their use as model organisms for understanding Sexual selection or parental care. Why is this so? Is it because Fishes are actually poor models? The usefulness of fishes as models for sexual selection and parental care is discussed by emphasizing some problems inherent in fish studies, along with a number of reasons why fishes are indeed excellently suited. The pros and cons of fishes as models are discussed mainly by comparison with birds, the Most Popular model organisms in animal behaviour. Difficulties include a lack of background knowledge for many species, and the problems of marking and observing fishes in their natural environment. Positive attributes include the diversity of lifestyles among fishes, and the ease with which they can be studied experimentally in the laboratory. HOW useful fish models can be is briefly illustrated by the impressive and broadly relevant advances derived from studies of guppies Poecilia reticulata and three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus. A selection of topics is highlighted where fish Studies have either advanced or could greatly enhance, the understanding of processes fundamental to animal reproductive dynamics. Such topics include sex role dynamics, the evolution of female ornamentation and mate choice copying. Finally, a number of potential pitfalls in the future use of fish as models for sexual selection and parental care are discussed. Researchers interested in these issues are recommended to make much more extensive use of fish models, but also to adopt a wider range of models among fishes.

Theoretical and empirical studies predict that under such conditions the cumulative costs of defense may be lower for older experienced males as a consequence of familiarity with environmental and/or social conditions in their particular local habitats. We used quantitative data from focal observational studies and introduction experiments to test the hypothesis that older collared lizard males (Crotaphytus collaris) with prior territorial experience (3 yr+ males) acquire larger territories allowing them to court more, different females, with greater frequency without incurring higher defense costs. Consistent with this hypothesis, 3 yr+ males controlled significantly larger territories and courted more females, without having significantly higher rates of territory patrol, frequencies of advertisement display, or aggressive interactions with same-sex competitors. Moreover, the intensity of responses to size- and age/experience-matched tethered intruders by 3 yr+ males was lower than that by 2 yr males in their first season of territory defense. Our results support the hypothesis that age/prior occupancy of territories lowers defense costs allowing males to defend larger areas and increase opportunities to court females, perhaps increasing mating opportunities. By contrast, 2 yr males may need to respond more aggressively to intruders because their ownership of territories is tenuous as a consequence of shorter territory occupancy.","Univ Cent Oklahoma, Univ Biol, Dept Biol, Edmond, OK 73034 USA","Baird, TA (corresponding author), Univ Cent Oklahoma, Univ Biol, Dept Biol, 100 N Univ Dr, Edmond, OK 73034 USA.",tbaird@ucok.edu,,,,,,72,17,17,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,JAN,2007,113,1,,,,,9,17,,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01297.x,,,9,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,126IN,WOS:000243506700002,,,,,2021-09-27,

On temperate rocky reefs, this has resulted in widespread kelp deforestation and the formation of sea urchin barrens. We hypothesize that the intact kelp forest communities are more spatially variable than the downgraded urchin barren communities, and that these differences are greatest at small spatial scales where the influence of competitive and trophic interactions is strongest. To address this, benthic community surveys were done in kelp forests and urchin barrens at nine islands spanning 1230 km of the Aleutian Archipelago where the loss of predatory sea otters has resulted in the trophic downgrading of the region's kelp forests. We found more species and greater total spatial variation in community composition within the kelp forests than in the urchin barrens. Further, the kelp forest communities were most variable at small spatial scales (within each forest) and least variable at large spatial scales (among forests on different islands), while the urchin barren communities followed the opposite pattern. This trend was consistent for different trophic guilds (primary producers, grazers, filter feeders, predators). Together, this suggests that Aleutian kelp forests create variable habitats within their boundaries, but that the communities within these forests are generally similar across the archipelago. In contrast, urchin barrens exhibit relatively low variability within their boundaries, but these communities vary substantially among different barrens across the archipelago. We propose this represents a shift from small-scale biological control to large-scale oceanographic control of these communities.","[Edwards, Matthew S.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Konar, Brenda] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Marine Sci, Fairbanks, AK USA","Edwards, MS (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",medwards@sdsu.edu,,"Konar, Brenda/0000-0002-8998-1612",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1435205],"This study was funded by the National Science Foundation (Award Number: 1435205).

Using birds on continental islands, we investigated characters that evolved in situ in response to insular environments created by late Pleistocene sea level rise. Location Trinidad and Tobago and continental South America. Methods We weighed fresh flight muscles and measured museum skeletal specimens of seven species of birds common to the continental islands of Trinidad and Tobago. Results When corrected for body size, study species exhibited significantly smaller flight muscles, sterna and sternal keels on Tobago than on larger Trinidad and continental South America. Tobago populations were more insular in their morphologies than conspecifics on Trinidad or the continent in other ways as well, including having longer bills, longer wings, longer tails and longer legs. Main conclusions We hypothesize that the longer bills enhance foraging diversity, the longer wings and tails compensate for the smaller pectoral assemblage (allowing for retention of volancy, but with a probable reduction in flight power and speed), and the longer legs expand perching ability. Each of these differences is likely to be related to the lower diversity and fewer potential predators and competitors on Tobago compared with Trinidad. These patterns of smaller flight muscles and larger bills, legs, wings and tails in island birds are not the results of selection for island dispersal and colonization, but probably arose from selection pressures acting on populations already inhabiting these islands.","[Wright, Natalie A.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Wright, Natalie A.; Steadman, David W.] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Wright, NA (corresponding author), 1 Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, 167 Castetter Hall, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",nawright@unm.edu,,,Ornithology Endowment at Florida Museum of Natural History; University of New Mexico from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering [T32EB009414]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB) [T32EB009414] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"The Ornithology Endowment at Florida Museum of Natural History funded much of this project.

It either holds its feeding organ, the siphon, at a fixed position just above the sediment surface to filter out food particles suspended in the overlying water or else extends and moves its siphon around to vacuum up deposited food particles on the sediment surface. Previous laboratory experiments have established an understanding of the role of current flow in dictating the choice of whether suspension or deposit feeding will be used by marine invertebrates with the facultative flexibility to choose. Faster flows imply greater fluxes of suspended particles so that the energetic rewards of suspension feeding are enhanced. Slower flows imply reduced renewal rates of suspended foods in the bottom boundary layers and enhanced deposition of food particles on the seafloor so that a switch to deposit feeding is favored. Like early optimal foraging theory, this understanding is based on energetic considerations alone without incorporation of broader implications of how population interactions such as predation and competition influence individual foraging behavior. Feeding behavior of Macoma balthica is influenced in the Neuse River estuary by both hydrodynamics and siphon-cropping by juvenile demersal fishes. Under conditions of identical concentrations of suspended particulates in the water column and organic contents of surface sediments, Macoma exhibited much higher levels of deposit feeding where currents were slower. In addition, exclosure and fish inclosure experiments demonstrated that juvenile demersal fishes influence feeding behavior of Macoma by cropping exposed siphons and inducing reduction in deposit-feeding activity. Effects of croppers were substantial in early to midsummer, when juvenile fish abundances were greatest in trawl samples from this estuarine nursery and before the growing fish exhibited ontogenetic changes in diet away from early concentration on bivalve siphons. Field experiments in which siphon-cropping fish were caged at varying distances off the bottom failed to detect any effective behavioral avoidance by Macoma of cropping in response to proximity of fish. One might have hypothesized that under high risk of cropping, Macoma would switch to suspension feeding and away from deposit feeding, the feeding method entailing more risk of losses to croppers because of greater siphon activity and greater extension of siphons on the sediment surface. Consequently, partial predation by siphon-cropping fishes greatly reduces deposit-feeding activity by Macoma balthica during summer as an apparent direct effect of disfigurement and reduction of siphons, the organ required for efficient deposit feeding. Information on current flows alone would not suffice to predict feeding behavior of this marine invertebrate: the influence of partial predation must also be included.",,"PETERSON, CH (corresponding author), UNIV N CAROLINA, INST MARINE SCI, MOREHEAD CITY, NC 28557 USA.",,"Skilleter, Greg Alan/F-9250-2010; Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012","Skilleter, Greg Alan/0000-0002-4719-0409; ",,,,71,60,61,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,1994,100,3,,,,,256,267,,10.1007/BF00316953,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PZ755,WOS:A1994PZ75500008,28307009,,,,2021-09-27,

From 2000 onwards, the two-year oscillations were re-established at a lower level. Here, we show that the two-year cyclicity prevalent in the 1980s was consistent with the hypothesis of asymmetric competition between adults and juveniles. Food consumption by juveniles of strong year-classes retarded growth and weakened condition of the co-occurring adults, resulting in less abundant year-classes. In 2000-2018, the role of intraspecific competition diminished due to interspecific competition from increased populations of other planktivorous fish, preventing vendace from attaining higher abundance. Elevated temperature probably confounded the effects of competition, but its direct role was masked by simultaneous gradual eutrophication and fish assemblage changes.","[Sarvala, Jouko] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; [Helminen, Harri] Luostarinkatu 3, FI-20700 Turku, Finland","Sarvala, J (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.",jouko.sarvala@utu.fi,,,"Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [09/109, 09/074, 1071004]; Foundation for the Study of Natural Resources in Finland; Lake Pyhajarvi Fisheries Management Association; Water Protection Association for SW Finland; Lake Pyhajarvi Collaborative Task Force; municipality of Sakyla; Department of Biology, University of Turku","This work was funded mainly by grants from the Academy of Finland to JS (09/109, 09/074, 1071004).

In laboratory experiments, the relative impact of each cue depended on which cues were presented in a given bioassay. Fruit color was the dominant cue in some contexts (e. g., larvae showed a significant perference for green fruit over red ones regardless of fruit size when fruits were equidistant from the larvae) but not in others ( e. g., when given a choice between a large red fruit placed close to the larvae and a small green fruit placed farther away, a significantly higher proportion of larvae chose the former). This plasticity in foraging behavior allows larvae to maximize foraging efficiency under conditions of differing fruit and larval densities, which this species experiences in nature.","Inst Quebecois Amenagement Foret Feuillue, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada; Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada","Marchand, D (corresponding author), Inst Quebecois Amenagement Foret Feuillue, 58 Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada.",dmarchand@iqaff.qc.ca,,,,,,32,7,7,0,10,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0892-7553,1572-8889,,J INSECT BEHAV,J.

We identified a naturally flammable heathy woodland ecosystem where the use of planned fire had increased the extent of older vegetation, and quantified the abundance of two small native mammals in this landscape (silky mouse Pseudomys apodemoides and heath rat P. shortridgei). We defined four time-since-fire (TSF) categories representing a 2- to 55-year post-fire sequence and, on the basis of a habitat accommodation model, predicted that both species would select younger age-classes over older ones. We also predicted that (i) much of the variance in vegetation structure would remain unexplained by TSF and (ii) statistical models of mammal abundance and occupancy including structural variables as predictors would be better than models including TSF. Pseudomys apodemoides selected 17- to 23-year-old sites, while there was no evidence that P. shortridgei selected a particular TSF category, findings that were inconsistent with our predictions. In line with our predictions, relatively large portions of the variance in vegetation structure remained unexplained by TSF (adjusted r(2) for four structural variables: 0.24, 0.29, 0.35 and 0.57), and in three of four cases there was strong evidence that statistical models of mammal abundance and occupancy including structural variables were better than those including TSF. At the site scale (hectares), P. shortridgei abundance was positively related to the cover of dead material at the base of Xanthorrhoea plants and at the trap scale (metres), the trapability of both species was significantly related to vegetation volume at 0-20 cm. Our findings suggest that TSF may not be a good proxy for either vegetation structure or species abundance/occupancy.","[Di Stefano, Julian; Owen, Laura; Morris, Robert; Duff, Tom; York, Alan] Univ Melbourne, Dept Forest & Ecosyst Sci, Creswick, Vic 3363, Australia","Di Stefano, J (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Dept Forest & Ecosyst Sci, Creswick, Vic 3363, Australia.",juliands@unimelb.edu.au,"Duff, Thomas/AAE-8591-2019; York, Alan/M-2443-2015; Di Stefano, Julian/M-9672-2019","Duff, Thomas/0000-0003-2116-3901; York, Alan/0000-0003-3161-4075; Di Stefano, Julian/0000-0001-7846-6642","Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment, Parks Victoria; Glenelg Hopkins Catchment Management Authority","This research was funded by the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment, Parks Victoria and the Glenelg Hopkins Catchment Management Authority.

Existing knowledge of the causes of decline and the effectiveness of conservation measures was reviewed. Population studies from the UK indicated three periods: a stable population before 1950, sharply decreasing numbers in 1950-1970 and a continued decline after 1970. Other European studies fitted into this picture, with a 10-year lag in each period. The onset of population decrease corresponded with a sharp decrease in chick survival mainly caused by reduced insect availability due to pesticide use. Several factors caused the continued decreasing numbers after 1970, such as decreased hatching success and an increased role of predation. Measures to restore partridge numbers should firstly focus on the main cause of population decline, that is, improve foraging conditions to increase chick survival rate. Next to creation of special partridge habitat, conventional agriculture offers good opportunities to improve foraging conditions. Only when an integrative approach is adopted may large-scale habitat improvements be realised to restore population level to the level before 1950.","[Kuijper, Dries Pieter Jan] Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland; [Kuijper, Dries Pieter Jan; Oosterveld, Ernst; Wymenga, Eddy] Altenburg & Wymenga Ecol Consultants, NL-6269 TZ Feanwalden, Netherlands","Kuijper, DPJ (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Mammal Res Inst, Ul Waszkiewicza 1D, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland.",dkuijper@zbs.bialowieza.pl,,"Kuijper, Dries/0000-0002-0324-5893",Vogelbescherming Nederland; Dutch partner of Birdlife International,"This literature study was part of a project sponsored by the Vogelbescherming Nederland, the Dutch partner of Birdlife International.

Six replicate groups of 5 fish were videographed pre-exposure, during a sublethal 2-h exposure to brevetoxin, PbTx-2 (PbTx, 40 and 55 ppb) or saxitoxin (STX,100 and 150 ppb) at the beginning (T-0-(30min)) and at the end (T-90(-120 min)) of the exposure period, and during recovery, 24-h post-exposure. Fish shoaling and social behaviors, including nearest neighbor angle (NNA) and nearest neighbor distance (NND) between fish, solitary and sedentary time, and number of conspecific interactions, were quantified and analyzed using customized software. There was no difference in shoaling behavior outcomes between the PbTx or STX high and low concentrations within observation times (p > .26). Exposure and post-exposure group outcomes were compared to pre-exposure (baseline) observations using repeated measures. PbTx- and STX-exposed fish showed altered shoaling behaviors during- and post-exposure, compared to preexposure baseline observations. PbTx-exposed fish showed heightened shoaling dynamics during early exposure observations (To-so), where shoaling time increased (p < .01), NND decreased (p < .05), and the number of conspecific interactions increased (p < .10). In contrast, STX-exposed fish showed suppressed shoaling dynamics during late exposure observations (T-90(-120 min)), where shoaling time decreased (p < .10), NND and NNA increased (p < .05), and the number of conspecific interactions decreased (p < .05). Recovery observations taken 24-h after PbTx- and STX-exposure, revealed groups of fish with suppressed shoaling dynamics including reduced group cohesiveness. Groups of fish post-exposure spent less time shoaling (p < .05) with greater NND (p < .10) and fewer conspecific interactions (p < .10). STX-exposed fish also had greater NNA (p < .01). PbTx-exposed fish spent more time sedentary while remaining in groups (p < .05) and more time solitary (p < .05). Results indicate that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of PbTx and STX have demonstrable effects on mummichog shoaling and group behaviors. Behavioral responses observed during HAB toxin exposure may be associated with the excitatory action of PbTx and the paralytic effects of STX. Post-exposure outcomes indicate impacted shoaling dynamics and group behaviors. Such changes are associated with reduced foraging capacity and predator vigilance, thus facilitating toxin trophic transfer, and ultimately decreasing survival for exposed killifish.","[Salierno, James D.; Kane, Andrew S.] Univ Maryland, Aquat Pathobiol Ctr, 8075 Greenmead Dr, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Salierno, James D.] Fairleigh Dickinson Univ, Dept Biol & Allied Hlth Sci, 285 Madison Ave, Madison, NJ 07940 USA; [Kane, Andrew S.] Univ Florida, Coll Publ Hlth & Hlth Profess, Dept Environm & Global Hlth, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Kane, Andrew S.] Univ Florida, Aquat Pathobiol Lab, Emerging Pathogens Inst, POB 110885, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Kane, AS (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Aquat Pathobiol Lab, POB 110885, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",KANE@UFL.EDU,,,"U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Science to Achieve Results (STAR) ProgramUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [R82-8224]; Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Maryland [R-00-36B]","Portions of the project were supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Science to Achieve Results (STAR) Program (#R82-8224).

We highlight a competition channel: in counties where OCC-regulated lenders had larger market shares, non-OCC-regulated lenders responded by increasing their supply of contracts with riskier features, such as deferred amortization, which were not restricted by the state anti-predatory-lending law.

We evaluated the indirect effect of supplementary UV radiation under glasshouse conditions on Bemisia tabaci settlement, eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) production and its effects on the flight activity of Nesidiocoris tenuis and Sphaerophoria rueppellii. Eggplants were daily radiated with different supplemental UV treatments, A+/B+, A-/B+ or A-/B-, during 30, 60 or 90min for 21days. The whitefly settlement was assessed immediately after the UV treatments or after 18 extra days on plants kept under regular glasshouse conditions with no further supplemental UV radiation. The number of whitefly settled on plants was counted after 2, 6, 24 and 48h. Supplementary UV radiation reduced whitefly settlement for all exposure times with alterations on the morphology and increased nitrogen and amino acid content of eggplants, mainly after 90min of UV radiation exposition. When plants were allowed to recover under regular light conditions, growth traits were similar, and whiteflies showed no preference. Fruit parameters were not negatively altered by supplementary UV radiation. Natural enemy captures per sticky trap were more abundant under A-/B+ and A+/B+ conditions; however, indirect host preference tests indicated no differences among treatments. In conclusion, supplementary UV radiation could be used to reduce whitefly infestation in glasshouses at the early stages of plant development without detrimental effects on crop yield or beneficial orientation.","[Prieto-Ruiz, Ines; Garzo, Elisa; Moreno, Aranzazu; Fereres, Alberto] CSIC, ICA, Dept Protecc Vegetal, Madrid, Spain; [Dader, Beatriz; Medina, Pilar; Vinuela, Elisa] UPM, Unidad Protecc Cult, ETSIAAB, Madrid, Spain; [Moreno, Aranzazu; Medina, Pilar; Vinuela, Elisa; Fereres, Alberto] Associate Unit IVAS CSIC UPM Control Insect Virus, Madrid, Spain","Fereres, A (corresponding author), CSIC, ICA, Dept Protecc Vegetal, Madrid, Spain.; Fereres, A (corresponding author), Associate Unit IVAS CSIC UPM Control Insect Virus, Madrid, Spain.",a.fereres@csic.es,"Fereres, Alberto/F-2990-2011; Moreno, Aranzazu/F-9309-2015; Medina, Pilar/K-5295-2017; Dader, Beatriz/AAR-1987-2020; Garzo, Elisa/G-3047-2015","Fereres, Alberto/0000-0001-6012-3270; Moreno, Aranzazu/0000-0003-1394-3123; Medina, Pilar/0000-0003-4642-3554; Dader, Beatriz/0000-0002-7328-1961; Garzo, Elisa/0000-0001-8626-5832","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [AGL2013-47603-C2-1-R, AGL2013-47603-C2-2-R]","The authors are indebted to Sandra Pla, Marina Morente, Irene Ontiveros, Andrea Wanumen, Miriam Gurpegui and Ignacio Morales for their assistance in the laboratory experiments.

The observed antagonistic effects within these guilds are resultants of enhanced predator-predator interactions due to the size and diversity of guild predators. Smaller ladybird predators maintained their usual body mass, probably by increasing their conversion efficiencies to compensate for their reduced prey consumption. However, larger ladybirds reported loss in their body mass, owing to their higher energy needs. The overall guild conversion efficiencies and growth rates were reduced. Among the experimental guilds, the observed prey mortalities were relatively higher in two-predator guilds, and within these two-predator combinations, the higher prey mortalities were recorded in those guilds where Coccinella septempunctata was one of the predators.","[Omkar; Mishra, Geetanjali; Kumar, Bhupendra; Singh, Neha; Pandey, Garima] Univ Lucknow, Dept Zool, Ctr Excellence Biocontrol Insect Pests, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India","Omkar (corresponding author), Univ Lucknow, Dept Zool, Ctr Excellence Biocontrol Insect Pests, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India.",omkaar55@hotmail.com,"Kumar, Bhupendra/AAR-9719-2020; Mishra, Geetanjali/X-7796-2019","Kumar, Bhupendra/0000-0002-7602-9681; Mishra, Geetanjali/0000-0001-8976-4602","Government of Uttar Pradesh, India","The authors are thankful to the Government of Uttar Pradesh, India for providing funds in the form of Centre of Excellence in Biocontrol of Insect Pests and also to Head, Department of Zoology, University of Lucknow for laboratory facilities and encouragements.",,73,8,12,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0008-347X,1918-3240,,CAN ENTOMOL,Can.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Within the context of trophic cascades, various treatments using in situ mesocosms were established in a closed estuary to highlight the importance of predation in stabilizing estuarine plankton abundances. Through either the removal (filtration) or addition of certain planktonic groups, five different trophic systems were established. These treatments contained varied numbers of trophic levels and thus different predators at the top of the food chain. The abundances of zooplankton (copepod and polychaete), ciliate, micro-flagellate, nano-flagellate and bacteria were investigated in each treatment, over time. The reference treatment containing apex zooplanktivores (early juvenile mullet) and plankton at natural densities mimicked a natural, stable state of an estuary. Proportional variability (PV) and coefficient of variation (CV) of temporal abundances were calculated for each taxon and showed that apex predators in this experimental ecosystem, when compared to the other systems, induced stability. The presence of these predators therefore had consequences for multiple trophic levels, consistent with trophic cascade theory. Conclusions/Significance: PV and CV proved useful indices for comparing stability. Apex predators exerted a stabilizing pressure through feeding on copepods and polychaetes which cascaded through the ciliates, micro-flagellates, nano-flagellates and bacteria. When compared with treatments without apex predators, the role of predation in structuring planktonic communities in closed estuaries was highlighted.","[Wasserman, Ryan J.; Noyon, Margaux; Froneman, P.

Understanding the effects of environmental factors on animal distributions is a central issue in ecology. However, movement rules inferred from distribution patterns do not reveal the processes through which animal distribution is realized. 2. We investigated individual movement rules using a process-based approach. In experiments, coastal fish larvae (red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus) were matched with an intraspecific competitor of different sizes, and time series of habitat transition of individuals were fitted with a continuous-time Markov chain model to evaluate the effects of the presence of a competitor, behavioural interactions and habitat quality on the likelihoods of habitat transition. 3. The process-based approach revealed that these factors did not simply act as a 'slope' between habitats that makes it easier to go in one direction and more difficult to return. Rather, these factors modify the movement rules differently depending on the directions of the movement. 4. Individuals were less likely to enter a better habitat in the presence of a larger conspecific, more likely to shift to a poorer habitat when they received aggressive behaviour and more likely to stay in a better habitat in the presence of food. However, no effect was found on the transition intensity for moving in the opposite direction. 5. The process-based approach to evaluating movement rules of animals allowed us to see the contrasting directional effects of different factors on the underlying movement rules used by animals, as opposed to pattern-based fitting of observed distributions. Consideration of these rules would improve the existing habitat-choice models.","[Nakayama, Shinnosuke; Ojanguren, Alfredo F.; Fuiman, Lee A.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Marine Sci, Port Aransas, TX USA","Nakayama, S (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge, England.",sn407@cam.ac.uk,"Ojanguren, Alfredo/F-1672-2011; Fuiman, Lee A/L-9514-2017; Nakayama, Shinnosuke/G-1991-2010","Fuiman, Lee A/0000-0003-2667-2684; Ojanguren, Alfredo/0000-0001-6273-1122",Marine Science Institute of The University of Austin at Texas,"We thank two anonymous reviewers and Dr Andrea Manica in University of Cambridge (UK) for suggestions to improve this manuscript.

In the search for key factors governing the outcome of competition, we examined the instantaneous predation efficiency and its light dependency. The visual predator Gobiusculus flavescens and the tactile predator Bolinopsis infundibulum were used as experimental models for the two predation modes. The predation rate of G. flavescens was adequately described by Holling's curvilinear disc equation, and that of B. infundibulum was proportional to prey density. However, because of superfluous feeding, the feeding rate of B. infundibulum differed from the predation rate and approached the asymptotic limitation at high prey levels. The predation rate was reduced for G. flavescens at irradiances <5-10 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1), whereas light had no significant impact on the feeding pattern of B. infundibulum. Provided sufficient light, the predation rate of G. flavescens was several orders of magnitude higher than that of B. infundibulum. These results are consistent with the results of other studies, which suggests that the maximum clearance rate (C-max) of visual and tactile predators is described by the power functions C-max = 3.42 x 10(-7) L-2.94 and C-max = 6.02 x 10(-8) L-1.77, respectively, where L is the length of the organisms in centimeters. We conclude that visual predation is most efficient at high visibility and low prey densities. As visibility decreases and prey density increases, the competitive efficiency of tactile predators increases.","Univ Bergen, Dept Fisheries & Marine Biol, N-5020 Bergen, Norway","Sornes, TA (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Fisheries & Marine Biol, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",tom.sornes@ifm.uib.no,"Aksnes, Dag L/A-9093-2011; Aksnes, Dag Lorents/O-4545-2019",,,,,35,55,61,0,24,AMER SOC LIMNOLOGY OCEANOGRAPHY,WACO,"5400 BOSQUE BLVD, STE 680, WACO, TX 76710-4446 USA",0024-3590,,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR,Limnol.

Here we investigate how animals that differ in their investment in scent-marking respond to simulated predation risk, by comparing the willingness to approach and counter-mark the scent marks of a competitor in the presence or absence of predator odor. We aimed to test whether animals that invest heavily in scent-marking, and which may thus be more vulnerable to eavesdropping predators, will either (1) take greater risks to counter-mark the competitor's scent or (2) reduce or abandon scent-marking. Using outbred male laboratory mice, Mus musculus, we show that, in the absence of predators, individuals which initially scent-mark at high frequency (high markers) approach the competitor's scent marks more quickly and spend more time in counter-marking than those which initially invest relatively little (low markers). In a sib-sib experimental design, simulated presence of predation risk (urine of ferrets, Mustela putorius furo) caused both kinds of individual to approach the competitor's marks more slowly, but high markers approached more quickly than low markers and spent more time in the vicinity of the competitor's marks. Only high markers significantly reduced their overmarking of the competitor's scent. These results suggest (1) that there is a unique danger inherent to scent-marking at high frequencies and (2) that high-marking males were prepared to accept increased costs of intrasexual competition in order to reduce the risk of predation. Further tests using the scent of naked mole-rats, Heterocephalus glaber, showed that these effects were not elicited simply by an unfamiliar odor. We discuss reasons for the observed difference in response to predation risk between the groups, and the implications of these results for counter-selection on scent-marking strategies.","Newcastle Univ, Dept Psychol, Evolut & Behav Res Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London NW1 4RY, England; UCL, Dept Psychol, London WC1E 6BT, England","Roberts, SC (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Dept Psychol, Evolut & Behav Res Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",craig.roberts@ncl.ac.uk,"Roberts, Craig/E-6919-2011; Roberts, S./A-2040-2009","Roberts, Craig/0000-0002-9641-6101; Gosling, Leonard Morris/0000-0002-2028-3488",,,,56,48,49,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

In a 6-week experiment conducted in large (100 x 60 x 60 cm) outdoor tanks containing floating macrophytes (Nymphaea caerula) and initially set up with one adult ampullariid for every three adult pulmonates, the numbers of B. Pfeifferi egg masses were always about half those in similar tanks without P. ovata. Although, by week 6, the numbers of B. pfeifferi in the control tanks (without ampullariids) had increased 5-fold, from an initial mean of 30 snails/tank, there was no significant increase in the numbers of B. pfeifferi in the experimental tanks (containing ampullariids). Results of experiments conducted in indoor glass aquaria indicated that adult P. ovata rapidly attacked egg masses or neonates (< 2.5 mm shell diameter) of B. pfeifferi but had no effect on the adults. The adult ampullariids also significantly decreased cover by floating macrophytes over a 6-week period compared with that in similar but ampullariid-free aquaria. This decrease in plant cover is relevant to biological control of the schistosome vectors as macrophytes serve as food, shelter and oviposition sites for pulmonate snails. The present results indicate the ability of P. ovata to inhibit multiplication of B. pfeifferi populations, at least under laboratory conditions, both directly, through predation, and indirectly, by competition for resources. Pila ovata may therefore prove useful in the biological control of medically important, pulmonate snails.","Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Biomed Sci Res Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya; Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Mkoji, GM (corresponding author), Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Biomed Sci Res Ctr, POB 54840, Nairobi, Kenya.",kemrilib@ken.healthnet.org,,,,,,26,2,4,0,3,MANEY PUBLISHING,LEEDS,"STE 1C, JOSEPHS WELL, HANOVER WALK, LEEDS LS3 1AB, W YORKS, ENGLAND",0003-4983,1364-8594,,ANN TROP MED PARASIT,Ann.

In 5 incubation experiments, conducted from May 1994 to March 1996, surface seawater was amended with 2 to 8% (v/v) rainwater additions. The additions yielded final nutrient concentrations from 0.98 to 5.93 mu M of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (NH4+ + NO3- forms) and 0 to 0.05 mu M of inorganic phosphorus (PO43-). In 4 out of 5 experiments, significant increases in chlorophyll a (chi a) were detected. The ratio of added N (mu g 1(-1)) to apparent increase in chi a (mu g 1(-1)) averaged about 100. The increases in chl a were correlated with increases in abundances of phototrophic nanoflagellates (PNAN). In contrast to chi a and PNAN stocks, no effect of rainwater addition was evident among the populations of autotrophic bacteria (Synechococcus sp.), heterotrophic bacteria, or the predators of bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates. In one experiment, there was no significant effect of rainwater addition; however, nutrient concentrations of unamended seawater samples were high (1.0 mu M DIN, 0.06 mu m PO43-).

I examine here the survival of eggs oviposited near the end of the flight season of adult Enallagma boreale in the presence and absence of potential cannibals, individuals that hatched from eggs earlier in the season, over an extended part of the life-cycle. The role of competition as a modifier of cannibalism was examined by manipulating egg density, environmental productivity, and habitat complexity. Survival in the absence of potential cannibals ranged from 5% to nearly 50% but was only 0-3% in the presence of cannibals. Survival of small larvae was related to manipulations of habitat complexity but not initial density or resources. There were no significant interactions of the presence of large larvae with other experimental treatments on the survival of small larvae. The mean size of small larvae was greater in the presence of cannibals. This may be because the cannibalism treatment reduced the density of small larvae and reduced competition for resources, or that the cannibals preferentially fed on small larvae and only relatively large individuals remained. Fertilization of the habitat or manipulating the initial density of small larvae did not affect mass of small larvae at the end of the experiment, which would be expected if small larvae were affected by competition for resources. Potential cannibals, however, emerged at higher mass when small larvae were present at low density and when productivity of the habitat was increased. This suggests that the negative effect of competition by small larvae outweighs the positive effect of being potential prey for large larvae.","UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA,DEPT ZOOL,VANCOUVER V6T 1Z4,BC,CANADA",,,,,,,,48,70,75,1,21,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,SEP,1994,99,1-2,,,,,60,65,,10.1007/BF00317083,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PJ341,WOS:A1994PJ34100008,28313948,,,,2021-09-27,

In this study, a landscape-ecology approach was applied to a marine soft-sediment environment to examine rates of predation and transfer of secondary production in and around vegetated habitats. Seagrass beds naturally occur in a variety of spatial configurations from patches 1-10s of meters across with interspersed unvegetated sediments (i.e., patchy coverage) to more continuous coverage with little or no bare sediment. I designed experiments to address how percent coverage of seagrass in a 100-m2 area of seafloor, and the spatial arrangement (degree of patchiness or fragmentation) of an equal area (100 m2) of vegetation affected predation (lethal) and siphon nipping (sublethal) intensity on an infaunal bivalve, Mercenaria mercenaria (hard clam). Measures of seagrass density and biomass with different percent coverage of seagrass were also made. When clams were placed in both the vegetated and unvegetated portions of the seafloor nearly twice as many clams were recovered live with 99% seagrass cover than with 23% seagrass cover, while survivorship was intermediate with 70% cover. Cropping of clam siphons from both the vegetated and unvegetated sediments was also affected by the amount of seagrass cover in a 100-m2 area of seafloor: mean adjusted siphon weights were approximately 76% heavier from the 99% seagrass cover treatment than from the 70% or 23% cover treatments. Survivorship of clams placed within an equal area of seagrass in very patchy, patchy, and continuous spatial configurations was 40% higher in the continuous seagrass treatment than in either of the two patchy treatments. This study demonstrates that transfer of secondary production in the form of predation and cropping on an infaunal organism is altered as the percent cover of seagrass changes. While large-scale changes in the amount and spatial patterning of vegetation may affect habitat utilization patterns and foraging HGLoopbehavior, increased seagrass density and biomass with increased percent coverage of seagrass limit any conclusions concerning predator foraging behavior and feeding success in response to patch shapes and sizes. Instead, local changes in seagrass characteristics provide the most compelling explanation for the observed results.",,"IRLANDI, EA (corresponding author), UNIV N CAROLINA,INST MARINE SCI,3431 ARENDELL ST,MOREHEAD CITY,NC 28557, USA.",,,,,,,45,141,148,0,49,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,1994,98,2,,,,,176,183,,10.1007/BF00341470,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NW266,WOS:A1994NW26600009,28313975,,,,2021-09-27,

Coniferous forest soil was patchily contaminated with three concentrations of sodiumpentachlorophenate PCP (0, 50 and 500 mg PCP kg(-1) of dry soil). Abundance of microbes, enchytraeids, nematodes, small oribatids and predatory mites were reduced by the PCP. Direct toxicity of PCP and lowered microbial biomass seemed to affect animal community composition in the most contaminated patches. Some large oribatids which seemed to be tolerant to PCP increased their numbers in the most contaminated patches. Although predatory mites suffered from PCP, no altered predator-prey interactions were observed. At the beginning of the experiment more nutrients were released in the parches with highest PCP concentration and the nutrients accumulated in the soil. Soil decomposer food webs seemed to be mainly bottom-up controlled: PCP strongly affects microbes and hence caused changes in the community structure of soil animals and nutrient cycling. Hence top-down orientated ecological models on community regulation and food web dynamics seem to be unsuitable when assessing effects of pesticides on soil communities.

Shrubs of Caryocar brasiliense are intensively visited by many ant species in the cerrado vegetation of south-east Brazil. Ants collect nectar from the extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) located on the buds at the apex of the plant. 2. The proportion of C. brasiliense shrubs occupied by ants greatly surpassed that of neighbouring plants without EFNs and this resulted in many more termites being attacked and removed on this plant than on plants lacking EFNs. Ant attacks on Caryocar were more frequent near the EFNs. 3. Ant-exclusion experiments with Caryocar shrubs revealed that ants significantly reduce the infestation levels by the butterfly Eunica bechina, the sucking bud Edessa rufomarginata, the bud-destroying fly Prodiplosis floricola and by a stem-galling wasp. Ants had no effect on the infestation by a leaf-galling wasp. 4. Control (ants present) and treatment (ants excluded) plants produced equal numbers of buds but flower and initial fruit production was significantly greater for ant-visited plants. Higher abortion rates of initial fruits by control plants resulted in similar final fruit and seed sets for plants in either experimental category. 5. The extremely low fertility of cerrado soils is suggested as a possible factor constraining the ability of Caryocar shrubs to provide the resources necessary for growth and development of their heavy fleshy fruits. Higher production of initial fruits by ant-visited shrubs would be neutralized by competition among developing fruits and subsequent abortion. 6. Possible ant-derived benefits to C. brasiliense include: protection of vegetative tissues during plant growth, larger floral display and increased attractiveness to bat pollinators, increased male contribution to fitness through pollen donation and selective abortion of genetically inferior progeny as the maternal investment is adjusted to match available resources.",,"Oliveira, PS (corresponding author), UNIV ESTADUAL CAMPINAS,DEPT ZOOL,CP 6109,BR-13083970 CAMPINAS,SP,BRAZIL.",,"Oliveira, Paulo S/E-1910-2013",,,,,63,131,144,1,46,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0NE",0269-8463,,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Results showed that individuals reduced their vigilance and increased their pecking rate when group size increased.

Vertical rock walls are often covered by lush, diverse communities of sessile suspension-feeding invertebrates, while adjacent horizontal substrates are dominated by algae, or corals in the tropics. Multiple factors, including light, sedimentation, water flow, and predation have been proposed to explain this pattern, but experimental tests of these hypotheses are lacking. We manipulated light level and predation to test whether variation in these mechanisms could be responsible for the shift in composition of sessile communities between vertical and horizontal surfaces in the rocky subtidal Gulf of Maine. Shaded horizontally oriented granite plots were dominated by invertebrates (e. g., ascidians, barnacles, bryozoans) after 25 months. Unshaded plots were dominated by macroalgae, which was virtually absent in shaded plots. Exclusion of grazers with cages had no effect on percent cover of invertebrates or algae. Preferential settlement of invertebrate larvae to shaded plots, due to larval behaviors such as negative phototaxis, did not seem to play a role. Shading likely affects post-settlement mortality of invertebrates by alleviating competition for space with algae, although greater abundance of micropredators in algal-dominated communities could also be important. Communities on shaded plots lacked many taxa present on natural wall communities, likely due to greater disturbance on horizontal substrates and/or lack of sufficient time for colonization of these taxa. These results suggest that light plays a key role in controlling the structure, composition, and function of shallow subtidal communities.","[Miller, Robert J.; Etter, Ron J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02125 USA","Miller, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",miller@msi.ucsb.edu,,"Miller, Robert/0000-0002-8350-3759",,,,77,74,75,3,46,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,2008,89,2,,,,,452,462,,10.1890/06-1099.1,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,276EN,WOS:000254124200017,18409434,,,,2021-09-27,

Under strong species sorting during colonisation and later by the restrictive environmental filter, traits that are not adaptive in subterranean habitats may be filtered out. We tested whether cave communities were assembled by the restrictive regime propitiated by permanent darkness or by competitive exclusion due to resource scarcity. When compared to surface communities, the restrictive subterranean regime would lead to lower functional diversity and phenotypic clustering inside the caves, and the opposite should be expected in the case of competitive exclusion. Using isopods (Oniscidea) as model taxa, we measured several niche descriptors of taxa from surface and cave habitats, used a multivariate measure of functional diversity, and compared their widths. We found phenotypic overdispersion and higher functional diversity in cave taxa when compared to surface taxa. On the one hand, the dry climate outside of caves hampered the survival of several taxa and their ecological strategies, not viable under severe desiccation risk, culminating in the clustering of functional traits. In contrast, this restriction does not occur inside of caves, where isopods find favourable conditions under lower predation pressures and more amenable environmental parameters that allow occupation and subsequent diversification. Our results showed that, at least for some taxa, caves may not be such a harsh environment as previously thought. The high functional diversity we found inside caves adds an additional reason for the conservation of these sensitive environments.","[Fernandes, Camile Sorbo; Bichuette, Maria Elina] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, POB 676, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Batalha, Marco Antonio] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Bot, POB 676, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil","Fernandes, CS (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, POB 676, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",camilesorbofernandes@yahoo.com.br,"Batalha, Marco A/C-9113-2012; Bichuette, Maria Elina/C-5262-2013; Batalha, Marco Antonio/P-1102-2019","Batalha, Marco A/0000-0002-8236-8022; Bichuette, Maria Elina/0000-0002-9515-4832; Batalha, Marco Antonio/0000-0002-8236-8022","Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Postgraduate Program on Ecology and Natural Resources from Federal University of Sao Carlos (PPG-ERN UFSCar); FapespFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2008/05678-7, 2010/08459-4, 2008/57949-4]; Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [573802/2008-4]","The first author (CSF) was supported by a PhD fellowship granted by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES: http://www.capes.gov.br/).

The ability of indigenous soil protozoa to survive and multiply when exposed to various concentrations of the fungicide fenpropimorph was investigated. The number of protozoan taxa in relation to biocide concentration was examined in enrichment cultures. The population dynamics of bacterivorous and fungivorous protozoa, hyphal forming units, and respiration activity were followed in soil microcosms amended with glucose and various concentrations of fenpropimorph. 2. The average number of flagellate taxa detected in 50-mg portions of air-dried soil declined from 12 to zero with fenpropimorph concentrations increasing from 0 to 60 mg L-1. Naked amoebae and ciliates were present at all fenpropimorph concentrations. The 50-mg soil portions initially contained 1.9 x 10(3) heterotrophic flagellates, 1.4 x 10(3) naked amoebae and about 5 ciliates. The presence of the two latter groups even at concentrations of 60 mg L-1 therefore suggests that they are more tolerant to fenpropimorph than the soil flagellates. 3. The addition of glucose had a strong stimulatory effect on soil respiration, which lasted for about 20 days. Soil respiration in microcosms amended with glucose and pesticide was of the same order as in systems with glucose only, however, soil respiration was significantly impeded in microcosm systems with a low pesticide content and stimulated in systems with a high pesticide content. 4. Bacterivorous protozoa (naked amoebae and heterotrophic flagellates) were affected at all tested concentrations (0.74-750 mg L-1) of fenpropimorph. High concentrations, 6.6-750 mg L-1, impeded growth of the total protozoan population directly. Lower concentrations only affected heterotrophic flagellates significantly, possibly through a change in the microbial food web leading to increased competition from and/or predation by ciliates. 5. A low concentration of fenpropimorph (20 mg L-1) had only little effect on hyphal forming units and fungivorous protozoa. Hence, the observed harmful effects on the protozoan populations are probably not mediated through an effect on the fungal populations. 6. Bacterivorous protozoa were affected by fenpropimorph at concentrations lower than those expected in soil after normal field application. Since protozoa play an important role in nitrogen mineralization, the beneficial effect of the fungicide may be counteracted by detrimental side-effects on soil N-mineralization.","Inst Zool, Dept Populat Biol, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark","Ekelund, F (corresponding author), Inst Zool, Dept Populat Biol, Univ Parken 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",,"Ekelund, Flemming/M-1731-2014","Ekelund, Flemming/0000-0002-2144-7659",,,,49,35,37,0,17,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

A variety of observational techniques such as plankton tows, sediment traps and experiments have contributed to our understanding of foraminifera ecology. But, fundamental questions around costs and benefits of calcification and the effect of nutrients, temperature and ecosystem structure on these organisms remain unanswered. To tackle these questions, we take a novel mechanistic approach to study planktonic foraminifera ecology based on trait theory. We develop a zero-dimensional (0-D) trait-based model to account for the biomass of prolocular (20 mu m) and adult (160 mu m) stages of non-spinose foraminifera species and investigate their potential interactions with phytoplankton and other zooplankton under different temperature and nutrient regimes. Building on the costs and benefits of calcification, we model two ecosystem structures to explore the effect of resource competition and temperature on planktonic foraminifera biomass. By constraining the model results with ocean biomass estimations of planktonic foraminifera, we estimate that the energetic cost of calcification could be about 10 %-50% and 10 %-40% for prolocular and adult stages respectively. Our result suggest that the shell provides protection against processes other than predation (e.g. pathogen invasion). We propose that the low standing biomass of planktonic foraminifera plays a key role in their survival from predation, along with their shell protection. Our model suggests a shift from temperature as a main regulator of foraminifera biomass in the early developmental stage to resource competition for adult biomass.","[Grigoratou, Maria; Monteiro, Fanny M.; Wilson, Jamie D.; Ward, Ben A.; Ridgwell, Andy] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Univ Rd, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England; [Schmidt, Daniela N.] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Queens Rd, Bristol BS8 1RL, Avon, England; [Ward, Ben A.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr, Ocean & Earth Sci, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Ridgwell, Andy] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Earth Sci, Geol Bldg,900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Grigoratou, M (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Univ Rd, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England.",maria.grigoratou@bristol.ac.uk,"Ridgwell, Andy/AAD-9487-2021; GRIGORATOU, MARIA/AAG-1663-2020; Wilson, Jamie/F-4782-2013; Monteiro, Fanny/B-8591-2011","GRIGORATOU, MARIA/0000-0003-0484-1408; Wilson, Jamie/0000-0001-7509-4791; Monteiro, Fanny/0000-0002-8790-0188; Ward, Ben/0000-0003-1290-8270; Ridgwell, Andy/0000-0003-2333-0128; GRIGORATOU, MARIA/0000-0001-9772-4918; Schmidt, Daniela/0000-0001-8419-2721",European Research Council PALEOGENiE project [ERC-2013-CoG617313]; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/J019062/1]; Royal SocietyRoyal Society of LondonEuropean Commission,This work was supported by the European Research Council PALEOGENiE project (ERC-2013-CoG617313).

Despite the prevalence of pesticides and the vulnerability of aquatic systems to insecticides, little is understood about the effect of lower concentrations of insecticides (<1 ppm) on aquatic community interactions. Whether insecticide effects are generalizable across different aquatic assemblages and trophic levels also is unclear. Furthermore, few investigators have examined the indirect consequences of insecticides beyond the primary consumer level. We examined how a single application of malathion at 3 concentrations (0, 6, or 40 mu g/L) and the presence or absence of zooplankton predators (larval salamanders) affected aquatic communities composed of zooplankton, phytoplankton, periphyton, and 2 geographically distinct amphibian assemblages from Oregon and Pennsylvania. At these concentrations, malathion was directly lethal to certain zooplankton species, causing a shift from cladoceran-dominated assemblages to copepod-dominated assemblages. The decrease in cladoceran abundance released top-down pressure on phytoplankton, allowing an increase in phytoplankton abundance. The increase in phytoplankton was associated with a decrease in periphyton (the major food source of anurans) because of competition between phytoplankton and periphyton. We did not find direct mortality in anurans or salamanders, but the insecticide-mediated reduction in zooplankton indirectly caused a decrease in larval salamander mass. In contrast, anurans exposed to malathion were heavier at metamorphosis. Overall, these results demonstrate that low concentrations of insecticides have indirect consequences on nontarget members of the community across multiple trophic levels, and the indirect insecticide-mediated effects are generalizable across 2 geographically distinct amphibian assemblages.","[Hua, Jessica; Relyea, Rick A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Hua, J (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",jeh115@pitt.edu; relyea@pitt.edu,,"Hua, Jessica/0000-0002-9553-902X",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We are grateful to Devin Jones for his assistance in conducting this experiment and Maya Groner, Josh Auld, and Chris Cox for their help in the take down.

The responses of Moina macrocopa (Cladocera) collected from Setiu Wetland lagoon (Terengganu) was evaluated through manipulative laboratory experiments to understand the ability of M. macrocopa to tolerate high salinity stress. Specifically, the fatty acid composition, growth, survival, and reproduction of this cladocerans species was examined. Sodium chloride (NaCl) as used in the treatments water with the concentration 0, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 15 salinity. Fatty acid levels were determined using Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrophotometry (GC-MS). The results indicated that optimal conditions produced the highest fatty acid content, especially the polyunsaturated fatty acid content, such as EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), ALA (alpha-linoleic acid), ARA (arachidonic acid), and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). Furthermore, M. macrocopa survival was best at salinity 0, with a percentage of 98%, whereas the opposite occurred at salinity 15, with approximately 20% of viable animals surviving. Besides, M. macrocopa also showed the highest reproduction rate at salinity 0 (e.g., average initial age of reproduction, 4.33 +/- 0.58 days) compared with other salinities level. Interestingly, the difference in growth at different salinities was not evident, an unusual finding when considering adverse effects such as osmoregulation pressure on the organism. Based on the results, we conclude that M. macrocopa can only tolerate salinity below salinity 8 and cannot withstand stressful environmental conditions associated with salinities above 8.","[Yuslan, Amirah; Najuwa, Sharifah; Suhaimi, Hidayu; Rasdi, Nadiah W.] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Fac Fisheries & Food Sci, Kuala Nerus 21030, Kuala Terenggan, Malaysia; [Hagiwara, Atsushi] Grad Sch Fisheries & Environm Sci, Fa Bunkyo 1-14, Nagasaki 8528521, Japan; [Ghaffar, Mazlan A.] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Fac Marine & Environm Sci, Kuala Nerus 21030, Kuala Terenggan, Malaysia; [Rasdi, Nadiah W.] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Inst Trop Biodivers & Sustainable Dev, Terengganu 21030, Malaysia","Rasdi, NW (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Fac Fisheries & Food Sci, Kuala Nerus 21030, Kuala Terenggan, Malaysia.; Rasdi, NW (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Inst Trop Biodivers & Sustainable Dev, Terengganu 21030, Malaysia.",amirahyuslan@gmail.com; syarifahnajuwa94@gmail.com; hagiwara@nagasaki-u.ac.jp; mag@umt.edu.my; hidayusuhaimi02@gmail.com; nadiah.rasdi@umt.edu.my,"Rasdi, Nadiah W./H-8910-2018; GHAFFAR, MAZLAN ABD/O-3604-2016; Rasdi, Nadiah Wan/L-4790-2019; Hagiwara, Atsushi/O-3606-2018","Rasdi, Nadiah W./0000-0002-7331-4866; GHAFFAR, MAZLAN ABD/0000-0001-9248-5284; Rasdi, Nadiah Wan/0000-0002-7331-4866; Hagiwara, Atsushi/0000-0001-7514-8737",LRGS Grant under Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia [56040]; Knowledge Transfer Grant under Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia [58106],"This work is jointly supported by the Knowledge Transfer Grant (Vot Number 58106), and LRGS Grant (Vot Number 56040) under Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia.",,52,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-2818,,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,MAR,2021,13,3,,,,,,,105,10.3390/d13030105,,,16,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,RD6LO,WOS:000633587100001,,gold,,,2021-09-27,

Thus, female anurans may face strong selection to repel unwanted suitors, but no mechanism is known for doing so. We suggest that a defensive trait (the ability to inflate the body to ward off attack) has been co-opted for this role: by inflating their bodies, females are more difficult for males to grasp and hence, it is easier for another male to displace an already amplexed rival. Inflating a model female cane toad (Bufo marinus) strongly reduced a male's ability to maintain amplexus; and females who were experimentally prevented from inflating their bodies experienced no successful takeovers from rival males, in contrast to control females. Thus, the ability of a female cane toad to inflate her body may allow her to manipulate the outcome of male-male competition. This overlooked mechanism of anuran mate choice may reflect a common evolutionary pattern, whereby females co-opt defensive traits for use in sexual selection.","[Bruning, Bas; Phillips, Benjamin L.; Shine, Richard] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Ecol Sci, NL-1081 Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bruning, Bas] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Phillips, BL (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Ecol Sci, Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 Amsterdam, Netherlands.",whatbeard@gmail.com,"Phillips, Ben/C-7957-2009","Phillips, Ben/0000-0003-2580-2336",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,"All studies were approved by the University of Sydney Animal Ethics Committee (L04/5-2009/1/5072).

A culture of Prymnesium parvum JX12 was isolated and established from the Pearl River Estuary of China. The toxic characteristics of JX12 to aquatic animals were investigated, considering the effects of temperature, salinity, and nutrients. Cultures of JX12 exhibited significant lethal toxicity to the fish, Mugil sp., M. soiuy, M. cephalus, Ctenogobius sp. and Chrysiptera parasema, and the brine shrimp, Anemia sahna, but no significant effects on the shellfish Ruditapes variegatus and the shrimp Penacus orientalis. The toxicity of JX12 to A. salina increased with growth of the culture. The decline phase displayed the strongest potency, followed by the stationary phase, exponential phase and lag phase. Also, there was a significant difference in toxicity among culture fractions of JX12 compared to whole-cell culture. For example, the toxicity of a cell-free culture filtrate on brine shrimp was reduced by 50% by the end of the experiment, while the sonicated and re-suspended cultures caused near 100% mortality. The toxicity of JX12 was also regulated by environmental factors such as temperature, salinity and nutrients. The strongest toxicities were at moderate water temperature (20-25 degrees C) and salinity (35 psu). The toxicity was reduced significantly at higher or lower temperatures and salinities. Furthermore, the toxicity of JX12 was greatly enhanced when ambient nutrients were deficient. Due to the potent toxicity of JX12 to multiple aquatic animals, especially fish and zooplankton, this species threatens the food web and trophic dynamics of coastal ecosystems. This study suggested that the ability to produce and release toxin(s) is an effective competition strategy for P. parvum to suppress predators and sympatric competitors and thus form blooms.","[Qin, Junlian; Zhang, Qun; Xu, Ning; Yang, Yufeng] Jinan Univ, Key Lab Eutrophicat & Red Tide Prevent Guangdong, Dept Ecol, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China; [Qin, Junlian; Yang, Yufeng] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai 519000, Peoples R China; [Hu, Zhangxi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China","Xu, N; Yang, YF (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Key Lab Eutrophicat & Red Tide Prevent Guangdong, Dept Ecol, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China.",txuning@163.com; tyyf@jnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41576159, 41977268, 61533011]; Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao) [LMEES-YTSP-2018-01-04]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [Grant nos. 41576159, 41977268, 61533011].

The Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum is an important prey species for sport fish; thus, determining the size of ingested shad can assist with evaluating competitive interactions, bioenergetic patterns, and niche partitioning and can add precision to predictive models. The gizzard organ of clupeids appears to be more resistant to digestion compared to other tissues and can often be found in the stomachs of predatory fish after other tissues from Gizzard Shad are digested. If the gizzard diameter is proportional to Gizzard Shad weight or length, it could be a useful structure for estimating the size of partially digested Gizzard Shad when other structures that are traditionally used to estimate weight or length (e.g., backbones) are damaged due to advanced digestion. For this reason, we evaluated the allometry relating gizzard diameter and Gizzard Shad weight and TL. We sampled a total of 936 Gizzard Shad from nine Oklahoma reservoirs. Fish were frozen and later thawed; they were measured for weight (+/- 0.01 g) and TL (+/- 1 mm), and the gizzard was then removed. Gizzard diameter was measured (+/- 0.1 mm) at its widest point using calipers. Eight different equations were evaluated to find the best relationship (lowest Akaike's information criterion) between gizzard diameter and weight or length. The relationship between gizzard diameter and fish weight was best modeled as a second-order polynomial, whereas the relationship between gizzard diameter and fish TL was best described by a five-parameter Richard's equation. Both relationships explained over 80% of the variation in Gizzard Shad size. The 95% CIs for weight (+/- 4-7%) and TL (+/- 2-7%) indicated good overall precision for mean fish size based on gizzard diameter. Therefore, we recommend using gizzard diameter to determine weight and TL from diet samples when advanced digestion of Gizzard Shad limits the use of more traditional metrics (TL, backbone length, etc.).","[Shoup, Daniel E.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, 008c Agr Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Tibbits, Jeff B.] Oklahoma Dept Wildlife Conservat, 1801 North Lincoln Blvd, Oklahoma City, OK 73152 USA; [Porter, Clayton P.] Oklahoma Dept Wildlife Conservat, JA Manning State Fish Hatchery, 18795 State Highway 49, Lawton, OK 73507 USA; [Snow, Richard A.; Porta, Michael J.] Oklahoma Dept Wildlife Conservat, Oklahoma Fishery Res Lab, 500 East Constellat, Norman, OK 73072 USA","Shoup, DE (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, 008c Agr Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",dshoup@okstate.edu,"Shoup, Daniel/A-9869-2013","Shoup, Daniel/0000-0002-9867-4497; Snow, Richard A./0000-0003-0199-7642","U.S. Sport Fish Restoration [F-86-D-1, F-112-D-1]; Hatch Project from U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture [1023034]; Department of Natural Resource Ecology and Management at Oklahoma State University","Support for this study was provided by U.S. Sport Fish Restoration Grants F-86-D-1 and F-112-D-1 to the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, the Department of Natural Resource Ecology and Management at Oklahoma State University, and Hatch Project Number 1023034 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture, administered by the Division of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources at Oklahoma State University.

This is due in part to a tradition in ecotoxicology of considering the direct effects of toxicants on a limited number of model test species. However, the indirect effects of toxicity may be a significant factor influencing the manner in which ecosystem structure and function respond to anthropogenic stressors. Subsequently, failure to incorporate indirect effects into risk assessment paradigms may be a significant source of uncertainty in risk estimates. The current paper addresses the importance of indirect effects in an ecotoxicological context. Laboratory, mesocosm, and whole ecosystem research into indirect effects is reviewed.

Both the diploid Leucanthemum vulgare and the morphologically very similar tetraploid Leucanthemum ircutianum have been introduced into North America. To verify which species is more prevalent in North America we sampled 98 Leucanthemum populations and determined their ploidy level. Although polyploidy has repeatedly been proposed to be associated with increased invasiveness in plants, only two of the populations surveyed in North America were the tetraploid L. ircutianum. We tested the enemy release hypothesis by first comparing 20 populations of L. vulgare and 27 populations of L. ircutianum in their native range in Europe, and then comparing the European L. vulgare populations with 31 L. vulgare populations sampled in North America. Characteristics of the site and associated vegetation, plant performance and invertebrate herbivory were recorded. In Europe, plant height and density of the two species were similar but L. vulgare produced more flower heads than L. ircutianum. Leucanthemum vulgare in North America was 17 % taller, produced twice as many flower heads and grew much denser compared to L. vulgare in Europe. Attack rates by root- and leaf-feeding herbivores on L. vulgare in Europe (34 and 75 %) was comparable to that on L. ircutianum (26 and 71 %) but higher than that on L. vulgare in North America (10 and 3 %). However, herbivore load and leaf damage were low in Europe. Cover and height of the co-occurring vegetation was higher in L. vulgare populations in the native than in the introduced range, suggesting that a shift in plant competition may more easily explain the invasion success of L. vulgare than escape from herbivory.","[Stutz, Sonja; Hinz, Hariet L.; Schaffner, Urs] CABI, Rue Grillons 1, CH-2800 Delemont, Switzerland; [Stutz, Sonja; Mueller-Schaerer, Heinz] Univ Fribourg, Dept Biol Ecol & Evolut, Chemin Musee 10, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Stajerova, Katerina] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Dept Invas Ecol, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic; [Stajerova, Katerina] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Ecol, Fac Sci, Vinicna 7, CR-12844 Prague, Czech Republic","Stutz, S (corresponding author), CABI, Rue Grillons 1, CH-2800 Delemont, Switzerland.",s.stutz@cabi.org,"Mueller-Schaerer, Heinz/H-5277-2011; Stajerova, Katerina/Q-8991-2017","Stajerova, Katerina/0000-0001-7824-1793; Stutz, Sonja/0000-0002-2951-6882","Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations, British Columbia; Canadian Agricultural Adaptation Program, through the Agriculture and Food Council of Alberta; Montana Weed Trust Fund, through Montana State University; Wyoming Biological Control Steering Committee; USDA Forest ServiceUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P505/11/1112]; Czech Academy of SciencesCzech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985939]","We would like to thank the following people for collecting seeds and for assistance in locating field sites: J.

We hypothesized that variation in predation pressure is caused by the spatial patterns of coral colonies, i.e., a continuous or a patchy distribution. We conducted field experiments to determine whether (1) survival of juvenile varies between sites with different habitat characteristics, (2) predation pressure is density-dependent, and (3) small-sized juveniles are susceptible to predation. For experiments, juvenile Dascyllus aruanus were released into model coral colonies, covered or not covered with a cage, set at two contrasting sites (continuous habitat: continuous reef, patchy habitat: sandy bottom) on a coral reef in Okinawa. The density of predators was not significantly different between continuous habitat (continuous reef) and isolated habitat (sandy bottom), Just after the start of the experiment, a higher proportion of juveniles moved out from the model colonies at continuous reef, while a smaller proportion of them tended to stay in the colonies at sandy bottom. Fish survived significantly better in the uncaged treatment at continuous reef than at sandy bottom. The survival of large juveniles was greater than that of small juveniles, although it was not significantly different. Although predation pressure did not have a density-dependent effect on juvenile mortality, the trend toward density-dependent survival was stronger at sandy bottom than at continuous reef, suggesting that a density-dependent effect of predation might occur more frequently in isolated habitat. Our findings indicate that predation pressure is affected by the habitat structure.","Natl Res Inst Fisheries Engn, Fisheries Agcy Japan, Ibaraki 3140421, Japan; Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Inst Biol, Sendai, Miyagi 9808578, Japan","Nanami, A (corresponding author), Natl Res Inst Fisheries Engn, Fisheries Agcy Japan, Ibaraki 3140421, Japan.",nanami@nrife.affrc.go.jp,,,,,,40,14,14,0,13,ROSENSTIEL SCH MAR ATMOS SCI,MIAMI,"4600 RICKENBACKER CAUSEWAY, MIAMI, FL 33149 USA",0007-4977,1553-6955,,B MAR SCI,Bull.

The held of ecological developmental biology seeks to look at development in the real world of predators, competitors, and changing seasons.

Fitness can be maximized directly by increasing the number of offspring (direct benefits) or indirectly by maximizing offspring's lifetime reproductive success (indirect benefits). Whereas there is considerable evidence in the literature for the influence of mating decisions on direct benefits, indirect benefits have been more elusive. Here, we review the variables that influence mating decisions made by females of freshwater fish and how these affect their fitness directly, as well as indirectly. Females enhance their fitness by matching their mating decisions to current environmental conditions. using a wide range of pre- and post-copulation mechanisms that enable them to maximize benefits from mating. Male sexual traits and courtship displays are signals used by females as a way of assessing male quality in terms of both direct and indirect benefits. Polyandry is very common among freshwater fish species, and indirect benefits have been hypothesized as drivers of its predominance. Despite intensive theoretical work, and multiple suggestions of the effects of indirect benefits, to date no study has been able to demonstrate experimentally the existence of indirect benefits in freshwater fish species. Additionally, most studies of direct benefits measure short-term benefits of mating decisions. In both cases, lifetime reproductive Success is not assessed. Therefore, we are led to conclude that evidence as to whether female mating decisions result in direct and/or indirect benefits in freshwater fish species is still lacking. These results should be considered in light of the ongoing debate about the significance of indirect benefits in female mating decisions.

However, the topic is rarely studied in marine plankton, the basis of the marine food web. Copepods show behaviors that suggest the existence of sexually selected traits, and recent laboratory experiments identified some selected morphological traits. Here, we use a 'life history-based' model of sex roles to determine the optimal choosiness behavior of male and female copepods for important copepod traits. Copepod females are predicted to be choosy at population densities typically occurring during the main breeding season, whereas males are not. The main drivers of this pattern are population density and the difference in non-receptive periods between males and females. This suggests that male reproductive traits have evolved mainly due to mate competition. The model can easily be parameterized for other planktonic organisms, and be used to plan experiments about sexual selection.","[Heuschele, Jan; Kiorboe, Thomas] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Ctr Ocean Life, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark; [Heuschele, Jan; Eliassen, Sigrunn] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, N-5020 Bergen, Norway","Heuschele, J (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Ctr Ocean Life, Kavalergarden 6, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark.",janheuschele@gmail.com,"Kiorboe, Thomas/ABI-4733-2020; Heuschele, Jan/A-8794-2013; Kiorboe, Thomas/G-3190-2011","Heuschele, Jan/0000-0001-8203-0542; Kiorboe, Thomas/0000-0002-3265-336X",DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG)European Commission [HE 6050/1-1]; Villum Fonden [00007178] Funding Source: researchfish,"Ken Anderson and Uffe Hogsbro Thygesen for help with error-functions; Sara Ceballos and Mie Hylstofte Sichlau for input data, and Oyvind Fiksen for discussions, as well as anonymous referees for constructive comments.

Ovipositing females should choose egg-laying sites which maximize the growth and survivorship of their offspring. Accordingly, they should avoid habitats with high densities of competitors and predators and should choose sites with adequate food. We tested experimentally the oviposition response of the mosquito, Culiseta longiareolata Macquart, to extra food and two species which are both potential competitors and predators of its offspring: conspecific larvae and green toad (Bufo viridis) tadpoles. 2. We conducted the experiment in outdoor artificial pools where wild C.longiareolata females were presented with choices of all combinations of the presence or absence of: (1) C.longiareolata larvae, (2) B.viridis tadpoles, and (3) extra food (a mixture of ground fish food and mouse chow). 3. Oviposition rates averaged approximately 4 times greater in response to extra food. 4. The presence of the tadpoles, particularly later in the experiment when they were larger, caused a significant reduction (approximately 50%) in oviposition rate. 5. We did not detect a statistically significant effect of conspecific larvae on oviposition habitat selection. 6. Our results indicate that Culiseta females choose habitats for oviposition based on food availability. They also tend to avoid habitats containing Bufo tadpoles, presumably to avoid predation and/or competition.","BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,BLAUSTEIN INST DESERT RES,MITRANI CTR DESERT ECOL,SEDE BOQER,ISRAEL",,,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",,,,23,117,119,0,48,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Smaller fish on the east side were more abundant (9.32 fish.m(-2); total abundance similar to 11 836 400 fish or 108 894 kg; mean WT = 9.2 g). Horizontal habitat-partitioning was observed between Arctic cod size classes over a small geographic area (similar to 8 km(2)), most probably due to partitioned resources and to mitigate predation risk.","[Kessel, S.

Specifically, an ecosystem will be considered a system containing living and non-living entities whose interrelationships include those of predator-prey and competition. On interpreting that orbits are associated with ecosystems' direct and indirect paths, it is possible to present a much more conceptual design of ecological networks. Findings - An ecosystem's two most important relationships, those of predator-prey and competition, appear to be interconnected with the concepts of coverage, invariance and orbit, with multiple properties. Originality/value - There are many interesting analyses of ecological networks' indirect effects that develop the quantitative and qualitative theory of ecological networks. What is new in this study is that it is the first dealing with orbits in the field of ecosystems.","Univ Alicante, E-03080 Alicante, Spain","Lloret-Climent, M (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",miguel.lloret@ua.es,"LLORET CLIMENT, MIGUEL/A-5638-2008","LLORET CLIMENT, MIGUEL/0000-0001-8040-3878",,,,7,1,1,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0368-492X,1758-7883,,KYBERNETES,Kybernetes,,2007,36,3-4,,,,,469,475,,10.1108/03684920710747084,,,7,"Computer Science, Cybernetics",Computer Science,172BM,WOS:000246779100016,,,,,2021-09-27,

Mangrove rivulus fish inhabit mangrove ecosystems where salinities range from 0 to 65 ppt, but are most often collected from areas with salinities of similar to 25 ppt. We examined the salinity preference of mangrove rivulus in a lateral salinity gradient, in the absence of predators and competitors. Fish could swim freely for 8 h throughout the gradient with chambers containing salinities ranging from 5 to 45 ppt (or 25 ppt throughout in the control). We defined preference as the salinity in which the fish spent most of their time, and also measured preference strength, latency to begin exploring the arena, and number of transitions between chambers. To determine whether these traits were repeatable, each fish experienced three trials. Mangrove rivulus spent a greater proportion of time in salinities lower (5-15 ppt) than they occupy in the wild. Significant among-individual variation in the (multivariate) behavioral phenotype emerged when animals experienced the gradient, indicating strong potential for selection to drive behavioral evolution in areas with diverse salinity microhabitats. We also showed that mangrove rivulus had a significantly greater probability of laying eggs in low salinities compared with control or high salinities. Eggs laid in lower salinities also had higher hatching success compared with those laid in higher salinities. Thus, although mangrove rivulus can tolerate a wide range of salinities, they prefer low salinities. These results raise questions about factors that prevent mangrove rivulus from occupying lower salinities in the wild, whether higher salinities impose energetic costs, and whether fitness changes as a function of salinity.","[McCain, Shelly C.; Kopelic, Sydney; Earley, Ryan L.] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, 300 Hackberry Lane,Box 870344, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Houslay, Thomas M.; Wilson, Alastair J.] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England; [Lu, Huanda] Zhejiang Univ, Ningbo Inst Technol, Ningbo 315100, Peoples R China","McCain, SC (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, 300 Hackberry Lane,Box 870344, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",scmccain@crimson.ua.edu,,"Wilson, Alastair/0000-0002-5045-2051; Houslay, Thomas/0000-0001-5592-9034; Lu, Huanda/0000-0002-4924-1038",Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology,This study was supported by a Grants-in-Aid of Research from the Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology.,,61,0,0,2,8,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

Previous studies have suggested that insectivorous birds can detect the HIPVs for prey location. The production of HIPVs is partly mediated by the jasmonic acid signalling pathway. Methyl jasmonate is one compound involved in the jasmonic acid signalling pathway. Therefore, spraying of methyl jasmonate (MeJa) solution on plants can induce the emission of volatiles similar to the HIPVs induced by herbivory. We performed two field experiments to test whether insectivorous adult birds are attracted to Pyrenean oak trees (Quercus pyrenaica) treated with MeJa solutions. We used artificial larvae to measure bird predation rate. There were no differences in the predation rates of plasticine larvae between control and MeJa treatments, suggesting that insectivorous birds were not attracted to trees treated with MeJa. We also tested whether blue tit nestlings without previous experience in foraging respond to the scent of Pyrenean oak tree leaves treated with MeJa, to test whether the attraction to MeJa-treated trees is innate. A similar number of nestlings performed begging responses when exposed to the scent of leaves of MeJa-treated trees compared to the scent of leaves of control untreated trees. Furthermore, the duration of the first begging was similar in response to the volatiles emitted by MeJa-treated trees and untreated trees. Despite previous evidence suggesting that insectivorous birds are attracted to HIPVs, our results show that neither insectivorous adult birds nor inexperienced nestlings were attracted to trees treated with MeJa. Further studies are needed to disentangle whether the differences in the emission of volatiles between herbivore-infested trees and MeJa-treated trees can explain this lack of attraction to MeJa-treated Pyrenean oak trees.","[Saavedra, Irene; Amo, Luisa] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, C Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Saavedra, I (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, C Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",irene.saavedra.garces@gmail.com,"Amo, Luisa/K-5960-2014; Saavedra, Irene/AAA-4640-2021","Amo, Luisa/0000-0003-4621-3493; Saavedra, Irene/0000-0002-7761-6562",Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2014-58890-P]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; Ramon y Cajal programmeSpanish Government,We especially thank Dr. Rindy Anderson and two anonymous referees for their useful suggestions.

YP appear to dominate the interaction, reducing BT abundance in lakes with YP present. We removed 90 % of YP from a 35 ha oligotrophic lake to test whether the removal of the dominant competitor would lead to an increase in growth and recruitment of juvenile BT. This manipulation shifted the YP:BT biomass ratio from 11:1 to 1.5:1. The food web response was evaluated using the pre-removal condition as the reference. The abundance of cladoceran zooplankton increased, especially large-bodied Dapnia catawba, and the body size of Daphnia dubia increased significantly, responses indicative of reduced zooplanktivory. Some benthic taxa (chironomid and Ephemeroptera larvae) also increased following YP removal. BT responded rapidly: mean length at age-1 increased from 11.6 cm to 12.8 cm (similar to 35 % weight increase), the condition of 15-25 cm trout improved, and stable isotopes indicated increased consumption of littoral-linked prey by 20 to 30 cm BT. YP, despite their reduced abundance, remained the primary prey of large BT (> 25 cm). The suite of changes observed in response to YP removal support the view that although YP are the primary prey of large BT, they exert a strong competitive effect on juvenile BT. Further study would be required in order to assess whether piscivorous BT can establish persistent top-down control of YP due to enhanced juvenile BT recruitment.","[Browne, David R.] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Rasmussen, Joseph B.] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Biol Sci, 4401 Univ Dr W, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada","Rasmussen, JB (corresponding author), Univ Lethbridge, Dept Biol Sci, 4401 Univ Dr W, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.",joseph.rasmussen@uleth.ca,,"Browne, David/0000-0002-1821-0191",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"The research was supported by and NSERC Discovery grant (JBR), and conducted at the Harkness Laboratory of Fisheries Research; we are grateful for the opportunity to work there and for the support we received from the staff, and we also thank the many field and laboratory assistants who helped.",,48,3,3,0,44,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

The reproductive health and seasonal variation of the reproductive end points of razorback sucker populations are currently unknown. Using nonlethal methods, we characterized the plasma hormonal fluctuations of reproductively mature female and male razorback suckers over a 12-month period in a hatchery by measuring their vitellogenin (VTG) and three sex hormones: 17 beta-estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), and 11-ketotestosterone (KT). Fish were identified as reproductive or nonreproductive based on their body weight, VTG, and sex hormone profiles. In reproductive females, the E2 concentration increased in the fall and winter, and increases in T and VTG concentrations were generally associated with the spawning period. Mean T concentrations were consistently greater in reproductive females than in nonreproductive females, but this pattern was even more pronounced during the spawning period (spring). Consistently low T concentrations (< 3 ng/mL) in adult females during the spawning period may indicate reproductive impairment. In reproductive males, spring increases in KT and T concentrations were associated with spawning; concentrations of E2 (< 0.48 ng/mL) and VTG (< 0.001 mg/mL) were low in males throughout the study. In addition, the E2 : KT ratio and T were the best metrics by which to distinguish female from male adult razorback suckers throughout the year. These metrics of reproductive health and condition may be particularly important to recovery efforts of razorback suckers given that the few remaining wild populations are located in a river where water quality and quantity issues are well documented. In addition to the size, age, and recruitment information currently considered in the recovery goals of this endangered species, reproductive end points could be included as recovery metrics with which to monitor seasonal trends and determine whether repatriated populations are cycling naturally.","[Hinck, Jo Ellen; Papoulias, Diana M.; Annis, Mandy L.; Tillitt, Donald E.] US Geol Survey, Columbia Environm Res Ctr, Columbia, MO 65201 USA; [Marr, Carrie] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Arizona Ecol Serv, Field Off, Phoenix, AZ 85021 USA; [Denslow, Nancy D.; Kroll, Kevin J.] Univ Florida, Ctr Environm & Human Toxicol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Nachtmann, Jason] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Dexter Natl Fish Hatchery & Technol Ctr, Dexter, NM 88230 USA","Hinck, JE (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Columbia Environm Res Ctr, 4200 New Haven Rd, Columbia, MO 65201 USA.",jhinck@usgs.gov,"Tillitt, Donald/AAW-3851-2020","Hinck, Jo Ellen/0000-0002-4912-5766",U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the Division of Environmental Quality,"The findings and conclusions in this article do not necessarily represent the views of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

We investigated the diving behaviour and diet of female macaroni penguins feeding small chicks on Marion Island (46A(0)52'S, 37A(0)5'E), South Africa, one of the species' most northerly breeding sites, supporting 4% of their global population. We then compared our results with similar studies from other localities. In December 2008, we collected information on 12 foraging trips from 6 individuals using time-depth recorders, as well as diet from 42 individuals. Median trip duration was 22.8 h (5.6-80.8 h). Penguins performed 42.8 +/- A 15.9 dives per hour at sea, with dive depths averaging 24.6 +/- A 8.6 m and lasting 40.8 +/- A 12.1 s, although 74.3% of dives were < 10 m. Euphasids dominated their diet (86% by mass), mainly Thysanoessa vicina. A second peak in dive depths at 55-80 m might reflect the 12% of fish in their diet. The substantial proportion of shallow night dives (30% of total dives) suggests some foraging occurs at night. Differences in diving patterns of individual macaroni penguins in this study confirmed the behavioural flexibility of these birds reported from other breeding localities. However, most other studies assumed that dives < 3-5 m were commuting dives whereas our study suggests that at least some prey are caught during shallow dives. We highlight how different analytical methods can change the outcome of studies. Despite macaroni penguins' apparent flexibility in foraging behaviour during the breeding season, their numbers are decreasing globally. Further investigations of their foraging behaviour are needed to assess potential competition with other predators and krill fisheries.","[Pichegru, Lorien; Ryan, Peter G.] Univ Cape Town, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Percy FitzPatrick Inst African Ornithol, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Ropert-Coudert, Yan; Kato, Akiko] Univ Strasbourg, IPHC CNRS, UMR 7178, F-67087 Strasbourg, France; [Takahashi, Akinori] Natl Inst Polar Res, Tokyo 1908518, Japan; [Dyer, Bruce M.] Dept Environm Affairs Oceans & Coasts, ZA-8012 Cape Town, South Africa","Pichegru, L (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Percy FitzPatrick Inst African Ornithol, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",lorien.pichegru@uct.ac.za,"Kato, Akiko/W-2447-2019","Pichegru, Lorien/0000-0003-3815-9845; Kato, Akiko/0000-0002-8947-3634; Ryan, Peter/0000-0002-3356-2056",National Research Foundation; Marine Living Resources Fund; DST/NRF Centre of Excellence at the Percy FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology,"Financial and logistical support was supplied by the South African National Antarctic Programme (through the National Research Foundation), the Marine Living Resources Fund and the DST/NRF Centre of Excellence at the Percy FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology.

A particularly imperilled population of mountain caribou was experimentally augmented with 19 northern caribou, a geographically distinct ecotype, from northern British Columbia. We examined seasonal variation in risk of predation by cougars (Puma concolor (L., 1771)) to the translocated caribou with comparison to resident caribou. Our basic approach followed the Movement Ecology Paradigm, in particular the interplay among why move, and when and where to move. We applied a cluster analysis framework on space-use patterns of GPS radio-collared animals to determine biologically relevant seasons. Then we examined the spatiotemporal similarity in habitat use between caribou groups and cougars across these seasons. This analysis included a control group of caribou from the donor herd that were not translocated. Five resident caribou seasons, two donor caribou seasons, and two cougar seasons were identified. Resident caribou remained at high elevations year-round and primarily selected habitats not used by cougars. In contrast, translocated caribou tended to occupy low-elevation habitats extensively used by cougars, resulting in predation of eight translocated caribou, six of which were by cougars. We concluded that the translocated caribou did not adopt the predator avoidance strategies of resident caribou, rendering them more vulnerable to predation. We make recommendations for future herd augmentations, notably that donor caribou should be of the same ecotype, have similar seasonal patterns of habitat use and associated behavioural repertoires, and be exposed to the same complex of predators.","[Leech, H.; Jelinski, D.

We reviewed 27 experimental and observational studies conducted around the world over the last 35 years that aimed to examine habitat use by feral and unowned cats. Our aims were to: (1) summarise the current body of literature on habitat use by feral and unowned cats in the context of applicable ecological theory (i.e. habitat selection, foraging theory); (2) develop testable hypotheses to help fill important knowledge gaps in the current body of knowledge on this topic; and (3) build a conceptual framework that will guide the activities of researchers and managers in reducing feral cat impacts. We found that feral cats exploit a diverse range of habitats including arid deserts, shrublands and grasslands, fragmented agricultural landscapes, urban areas, glacial valleys, equatorial to sub-Antarctic islands and a range of forest and woodland types. Factors invoked to explain habitat use by cats included prey availability, predation/competition, shelter availability and human resource subsidies, but the strength of evidence used to support these assertions was low, with most studies being observational or correlative. We therefore provide a list of key directions that will assist conservation managers and researchers in better understanding and ameliorating the impact of feral cats at a scale appropriate for useful management and research. Future studies will benefit from employing an experimental approach and collecting data on the relative abundance and activity of prey and other predators. This might include landscape-scale experiments where the densities of predators, prey or competitors are manipulated and then the response in cat habitat use is measured. Effective management of feral cat populations could target high-use areas, such as linear features and structurally complex habitat. Since our review shows often-divergent outcomes in the use of the same habitat components and vegetation types worldwide, local knowledge and active monitoring of management actions is essential when deciding on control programs.","[Doherty, Tim S.; Davis, Robert A.] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Joondalup, WA 6027, Australia; [Bengsen, Andrew J.] New South Wales Dept Primary Ind, Vertebrate Pest Res Unit, Orange, NSW 2800, Australia","Doherty, TS (corresponding author), Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Nat Sci, 270 Joondalup Dr, Joondalup, WA 6027, Australia.",t.doherty@ecu.edu.au,"Davis, Robert/F-6621-2012; Bengsen, Andrew/H-4844-2019; Bengsen, Andrew J/B-1994-2012; Doherty, Tim S./G-9354-2015","Davis, Robert/0000-0002-9062-5754; Bengsen, Andrew/0000-0003-2205-4416; Bengsen, Andrew J/0000-0003-2205-4416; Doherty, Tim S./0000-0001-7745-0251",Earthwatch Institute Australia; Edith Cowan University,TSD was supported by scholarships from Earthwatch Institute Australia and Edith Cowan University while conducting this research.

In an immune-induced dormant state, potentially lethal cancer cells persist in a state where growth is restricted, to little or no increase, by the host's immune response. To describe this state in the context of cancer progression and immune response, basic temporal (spatially homogeneous) quantitative predator-prey constructs are discussed, along with some current and proposed augmentations that incorporate potentially significant biological phenomena such as the cancer cell transition to a quiescent state or the time delay in T-cell activation. Advances in cancer-immune modeling that describe complex interactions underlying the ability of the immune system to both promote and inhibit tumor growth are emphasized. Finally, the review concludes by discussing future mathematical challenges and their biological significance.","Tufts Univ, Steward Res & Specialty Projects Corp, St Elizabeths Med Ctr, Ctr Canc Syst Biol,Sch Med, Boston, MA 02135 USA","Wilkie, KP (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Steward Res & Specialty Projects Corp, St Elizabeths Med Ctr, Ctr Canc Syst Biol,Sch Med, 736 Cambridge St, Boston, MA 02135 USA.",kpwilkie@alumni.uwaterloo.ca,,"Wilkie, Kathleen/0000-0002-3226-724X",NCI NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [U54CA149233] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [U54CA149233] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,,,82,45,46,0,25,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0065-2598,2214-8019,978-1-4614-1444-5; 978-1-4614-1445-2,ADV EXP MED BIOL,Adv.Exp.Med.Biol.,,2013,734,,,,,,201,234,,10.1007/978-1-4614-1445-2_10,10.1007/978-1-4614-1445-2,,34,"Oncology; Medicine, Research & Experimental",Oncology; Research & Experimental Medicine,BA2XQ,WOS:000333981300012,23143981,,,,2021-09-27,

Unlike insect predators, which may need to consume many prey items to attain maturity, parasitoids generally rely on a limited amount of resources that are obtained from a single source (the host). This review discusses a range of ecophysiological constraints that affect host quality and concomitantly the evolution of development strategies in parasitoids. Two macroevolutionary differences in host usage strategies (idiobiosis, koinobiosis) are initially described. Over many years, particular attention has been paid in examining a range of quantitative host attributes such as size, age, or stage, as these affect idiobiont and koinobiont parasitoid development. Parasitoids and their hosts, however, constitute only a small part of an ecological community. Consequently, host quality may be affected by a broad range of factors that may operate over variable spatial and temporal scales. Intimate factors include aggressive competition with other parasitoids and pathogens for access to host resources, whereas less intimate factors include the effects of toxic plant compounds (allelochemicals) on parasitoid performance as mediated through primary and/or secondary hosts. It is suggested that future experiments should increase the levels of trophic complexity as these influence the evolution of life history and development strategies in parasitoids. This includes integration of a suite of direct and indirect mechanisms, including biological processes occurring in different ecological realms, such as above-ground and below-ground interactions.","Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Terr Ecol, Dept Multitroph Interact, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands","Harvey, JA (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Terr Ecol, Dept Multitroph Interact, POB 40,Boterhoeksestr 48, NL-6666 ZG Heteren, Netherlands.",j.harvey@nioo.knaw.nl,"Harvey, Jeffrey A/B-7439-2008","Harvey, Jeffrey A/0000-0002-4227-7935",,,,153,194,208,2,70,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-8703,1570-7458,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

With the objective of determining whether environmental temperature is one of the possible causes which explains the observed distribution pattern, two behavioural responses were analysed during an experimental period of increasing water temperature: number of opercular movements (an indirect measure of energy expenditure) and activity levels. The interactions of temperature x time and body size x time had a significant effect on the number of opercular movements. At low temperatures (13-15degrees C, large fish reached a maximum number of opercular movements, while small fish reached a maximum only at high temperatures (23-25degreesC . The interaction temperature x time had a significant effect on activity levels of different body sizes. In general, large fish appeared to be less active than small fish, however, at very high temperatures (24-26degrees C all individuals increased their activity levels. These data indicate that small fish are acclimatized to live in a wider range of temperatures (13-23degrees C, and, for fish of all body sizes, the highest temperatures (23-26degrees C probably constitute a suboptimal microhabitat. Strong territoriality was observed, with large individuals displacing smaller individuals. These data suggest that temperature is an important factor in explaining why large individuals are not present in high tidal pools (high temperatures), whereas territoriality explains why small individuals are not in low tidal pools (habitat of large individuals).

The gall-forming midge Rhopalomyia californica was exposed experimentally to parasitism and predation during only the egg stage, during only the larval stage, during neither stage, or during both stages. 2. The combined action of natural enemies that attack during both the egg stage and the larval stage led to the lowest number of midges and total insects (midges + parasitoids) in the next generation, and the highest percentage parasitism. 3. The larval parasitoid killed a large fraction of hosts without producing new parasitoid offspring, while there is some indication that the egg parasitoid on its own tended to produce the most parasitoid offspring. The contrasting implications of host mortality versus parasitoid production for biological control are discussed. 4. Exposure to larval parasitoids resulted in a reduction in the number of egg parasitoid offspring produced, but exposure to the egg parasitoid did not affect the number of larval parasitoid offspring produced significantly.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Briggs, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",cbriggs@socrates.berkeley.edu; jlatto@socrates.berkeley.edu,"Briggs, Cheryl/F-7456-2013","Briggs, Cheryl/0000-0001-8674-5385",,,,33,13,13,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

For arc-eye hawkfish, the numerically dominant species, recruitment (defined as the contribution of young-of-year to the benthic population within several months after settlement from the water column) varied 7-fold among years averaged over sites. Nonetheless, recruitment also differed spatially, with sites along the Kohala Peninsula comprising a high recruitment group. Spatial differences were persistent (some sites predictably low, others predictably high) and generally lacked demonstrable variation over time. Complementary em pirical data suggested that post-settlement processes (predation, interspecific competition) also affected recruitment. A dispersal model combined with currents from an oceanic circulation model (Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model, HYCOM) was used to simulate the spatial patterns of settlement by larvae released throughout the main Hawaiian Islands. These simulations generally agreed with observed spatial patterns of recruitment. Greater recruitment was also predicted near geomorphological features (headlands) on Hawaii Island most influenced by the flow of surface eddy currents generated by prevailing E-NE trade winds. Empirical data and simulations together suggest that the headlands of west Hawaii Island likely enhance recruitment by intercepting or concentrating larvae at greater rates, but that post-settlement processes dampen variations in settlement. We suggest that habitat geomorphology should be considered in the criteria used to select sites for no-take Marine Protected Areas at Hawaii Island.","[DeMartini, Edward E.] NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Hawaii Res Ctr, Aiea, HI 96701 USA; [Wren, Johanna L.

Here, we test the hypothesis that the prevailing algal-bacterial interaction shifted in two years (2005 versus 2015), due to increased temperature (T) and Saharan dust depositions in high-mountain lakes of Sierra Nevada (S Spain). Our results support the starting hypothesis that the nature of the prevailing algal-bacterial interaction shifted from a bacterivory control exerted by algae to commensalism, coinciding with a higher air and water T as well as the lower ratio sestonic nitrogen (N): phosphorous (P), related to greater aerosol inputs.

The aim of this study was to examine catfish movement and habitat selection within an invaded impoundment in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Acoustic telemetry data for 10 tagged catfish were analyzed to identify spatial patterns in home ranges and seasonal changes in habitat associations. Long-distance movements were observed for most catfish from common central release point, whereas short-distance movements defined their home ranges and utilization distributions that were categorized as localized within single or multiple habitats. Habitat selection was non-random with most catfish utilizing the shallow river mouth and upper section of the reservoir that were dominated by a rocky substratum interspersed with submerged trees. These localities were likely to be preferred for spawning and/or feeding. Utilization of these habitats by catfish is likely to be associated with probable impact due to predation and interference competition for feeding and breeding grounds with other species. Although most catfish maintained their home ranges throughout the study, seasonal shifts in habitat use, which was reflected by the utilization of deep and silt-dominated habitats, were also observed for some catfish. Non-random habitat use and homing behaviour within single and multiple habitats by non-native sharptooth catfish suggests that its impact within the invaded habitats may be associated with particular habitats both at broad spatial and temporal scales. Protection of habitats from catfish invasion should be considered as a management option to conserve native biota.","[Kadye, W. T.; Booth, A.

However, when functional morphology is invoked on an ad hoc basis there exists a risk of circular reasoning. Performance spaces/landscapes constructed using biomechanical experiments can be used to tie performance to morphology quantitatively. They can be used to estimate fitness and function in specific environments by allowing multiple specific measures of function to be evaluated simultaneously. Absolute performance can be used to constrain palaeoenvironmental interpretations by detecting functional limits. We constructed a performance space with four variables (transport resistance, settling time, settling orientation and respiration potential) relating to hydrodynamic and metabolic variables. We combine new performance data with existing palaeoenvironmental interpretations and associated distributions of brachiopods of the suborder Productidina during the late Carboniferous and early Permian in the North American Midcontinent. Productidines were chosen because they lacked pedicles and relied on body and spine morphology to interact with their environment. Offshore dysoxia-associated taxa had increased resistance to sinking and proportionally larger lophophores, potentially improving survivorship in low-oxygen, soft substrate environments. Taxa associated with nearshore and oxygenated offshore environments display a range in performance consistent with a range of conditions, but all had proportionally smaller lophophores. Models that are less stable in high-velocity flows consistently settle in the correct convex down orientation if entrained, while more stable models did not. Our study suggests that as productidines radiated during the Carboniferous, they also differentiated within the performance space.","[Dievert, Rylan, V; Gingras, Murray K.; Leighton, Lindsey R.] Univ Alberta, 1-26 Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada","Dievert, RV (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, 1-26 Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.",dievert@ualberta.ca; mgingras@ualberta.ca; lindsey.leighton@ualberta.ca,,,NSERC Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"Funding for this study was provided by an NSERC Discovery Grant awarded to Leighton.

One male emigrated from each of three study, groups, providing ideal experimental conditions for examining the effect of coresident males on male vigilance behavior (social and nonsocial). Following the predator and conspecific defense theories for the adaptive value of male vigilance behavior and the occurrence of multimale groups, I predicted that male nonsocial vigilance would increase after the emigration of a coresident male. My prediction was supported in only one of the three study groups. Males in two groups decreased their nonsocial vigilance after the emigration of a coresident male, which was probably influenced by seasonal changes and the peripherality, of one group's coresident male before his emigration. The social vigilance hypothesis proposes that for species with rigid dominance hierarchies, social vigilance should increase with an increase in same sex competitors. Therefore, I predicted that male social vigilance would decrease after the emigration of a coresident male. The hypothesis is generally supported in my findings, as two of the three groups displayed a decrease in social vigilance after the emigration of a coresident male. Increased social vigilance in the third group is best explained by, the change in the alpha male social behavior after the emigration of his only, coresident male.","Univ Alberta, Dept Anthropol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada","Jack, KM (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Anthropol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada.",,,,,,,52,10,10,0,8,KLUWER ACADEMIC/PLENUM PUBL,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0164-0291,,,INT J PRIMATOL,Int.

Most studies have considered only a single putative causal agent and have failed to recognise that different environmental agents are often correlated. Darwin suggested that although trait variation across populations is often associated with abiotic variation, evolution is more likely to be driven by biotic factors correlated with the abiotic variation. This hypothesis has received little explicit attention. We use structural equation modelling to quantify the relative importance of abiotic (pH, metal concentrations) and biotic (competition, predation) factors in the evolution of body size in three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus on the island of North Uist, Scotland. We combine phenotypic data from multiple isolated populations, detailed characterisation of their environment and a common garden experiment that establishes the genetic basis of size differences. Three-spined sticklebacks on North Uist show almost unprecedented intraspecific evolution of body size that has taken place rapidly (<16000years). The smallest fish mature at only 7% of the mass of ancestral, anadromous fish. Dwarfism is associated with reduced abundance of a smaller competitor species, the nine-spined stickleback Pungitius pungitius, and with low pH indicative of poor resource conditions. Dwarfism also tends to occur where an important predator, the brown trout Salmo trutta, is also small. The abundance of P.pungitius and the size of S.trutta are themselves related to underlying abiotic environmental variation. Despite the close association between abiotic and biotic factors across populations, our results support Darwin's hypothesis that biotic factors, associated with variation in the abiotic environment, are more important in explaining evolution than is abiotic variation per se. This study demonstrates the importance of considering the relationships between environmental variables before conclusions can be drawn about the causes of (body size) evolution on islands.","[MacColl, Andrew D.

Sex of the defending parent and the identity of the predator being defended against were the most significant determinants of variation in the 13 aspects of parental defense behavior measured. Males defended more aggressively than did females. This may be a correlate of stronger territorial behavior in this sex, rather than a strategic response to differing relatedness to the brood. Ferrets were defended against more strongly than were snakes. This may be a response to greater efficacy of defense behavior against ferrets. Attendance measures of the male and female parent at the nest are highly correlated, whereas intensity measures are much less so. Even those intensity measures that are significantly positively correlated have distributions with many pairs in which one parent does considerable defense and the other does none. I suggest that parents are monitoring each other in the presence of the predator and refraining from defense to get their mates to defend actively. On the basis of observations of defense against many species, I suggest that defense has three functions in Tree Swallows: Intimidation of small nest-site competitors, moving on, and distraction of larger nest predators. There is evidence that variation in both the costs and benefits of defense are important in affecting its intensity. Despite the large number of potential determinants examined, a large proportion of the variance in parental defense behavior remained unexplained. This large residual variation may be either an adaptation to avoid predator localization of the nest or enhance distraction, or a result of relatively low selective pressures or low frequencies of encounter between predators and swallows.",,"WINKLER, DW (corresponding author), CORNELL UNIV,DIV BIOL SCI,ECOL & SYSTEMAT SECT,ITHACA,NY 14853, USA.",,,,,,,42,55,55,0,15,COOPER ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC,LAWRENCE,"ORNITHOLOGICAL SOC NORTH AMER PO BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044-8897",0010-5422,,,CONDOR,Condor,MAY,1992,94,2,,,,,502,520,,10.2307/1369222,,,19,Ornithology,Zoology,HV531,WOS:A1992HV53100018,,,,,2021-09-27,

The effects of CMV amendment on detritus micro-food web were investigated in a six-year field experiment. Compared to the mineral fertilizers (NPK) alone, the fertilizers combined with CMV (NPK + CMV) increased soil organic carbon content, and thus enhanced the biomass of microorganisms, as well as protozoa abundance, while did not change micro-feeding nematode abundance (MN). This indicates a substrate-driven bottom-up effect. However, the green manure application increased omnivores-predators (OP) abundance and the OP/MN ratio, suggesting a top-down effect. Higher F/B ratio indicates a shift of the food web energy structure towards to fungi-dominated channel in the manured soil.

Here we address how two important ecological variables - extrinsic periodic mortality events (disturbances) and the presence of obligate-killing parasites - interact to affect the diversity of niche-specialist genotypes in laboratory populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. Consistent with previous studies, diversity was maximized at intermediate frequencies of disturbance in the absence of parasitic bacteriophages (phages). By contrast, no relationship was found between diversity and disturbance frequency in the presence of phage. The results can be explained in part by differential effects of phage on bacterial densities, and hence resource competition, under different disturbance regimes.","Univ Bath, Dept Biol & Biochem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England","Morgan, AD (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",andrew.morgan@zoo.ox.ac.uk,"Morgan, Andrew D/C-4948-2008",,,,,42,17,18,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Such behavioral sequences can be of critical ecological importance, for example relating to resource acquisition, predator evasion, and sexual selection. The role of sequential behaviors in ecology, however, is understudied, in substantial part due to the difficulty of quantifying complex sequences. Here, we present a modified version of determinism (DET) from recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) as a standard metric for quantifying sequential behaviors. We focus on a case study of trapline foraging, a taxonomically widespread behavioral strategy in which animals repeatedly visit spatially fixed resources in a predictable order. Using a bumble bee movement dataset, we demonstrate how to calculate DET and create and interpret recurrence plots, which visually demonstrate patterns in foraging sequences. We show a new method for statistical comparisons of DET scores and assess the sensitivity of DET to resource density using simulated foraging sequences. We find that DET complements and offers distinct advantages over previously available methods for many questions and datasets since it does not depend on any particular resource arrangement or experimental setup and is relatively insensitive to resource density. These features make DET a powerful tool for comparing sequential behaviors between differing environments in a range of ecologically important contexts.","[Ayers, Carolyn A.; Brosi, Berry J.] Emory Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Ayers, Carolyn A.; Brosi, Berry J.] Emory Univ, Program Populat Biol Ecol & Evolut, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Armsworth, Paul R.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Armsworth, Paul R.] Univ Tennessee, Natl Inst Math & Biol Synth, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Ayers, CA (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Dept Environm Sci, 400 Dowman Dr,Suite e510, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",cayers2@emory.edu,,"Armsworth, Paul/0000-0003-0918-0573; Brosi, Berry/0000-0002-9233-1151","US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1120572]; National Science Foundation through NSF AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-1300426]; University of Tennessee, Knoxville; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1120572] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work was funded by the US National Science Foundation (Award # DEB-1120572 to B.

There is a great variety in brood sizes of at least two orders-of-magnitude across the family. However, little is known about the ramifications of this remarkable variation for the incidence and degree of multiple paternity and reproductive skew. Mollies (subgenusMollienesia, genusPoecilia) produce some of the largest broods in the family Poeciliidae, making them an excellent model to study the effects of intra-specific variation in brood size on patterns of multiple paternity. We collected samples of the live-bearing fishPoecilia gilliifrom 9 locations in Costa Rica. We measured body size of 159 adult females, of which 72 were pregnant. These samples had a mean brood size of 47.2 +/- 3.0 embryos, ranging from 4 to 130 embryos. We genotyped 196 field-collected specimens with 5 microsatellite markers to obtain location-specific allele frequencies. In addition, we randomly selected 31 pregnant females, genotyped all their embryos (N= 1346) and calculated two different parameters of multiple paternity: i.e., the minimum number of sires per litter using an exclusion-based method (GERUD) and the estimated number of sires per litter using a maximum likelihood approach (COLONY). Based on these two approaches, multiple paternity was detected in 22 and 27 (out of the 31) females, respectively, with the minimum number of sires ranging from 1 to 4 (mean +/- SE: 2.1 +/- 0.16 sires per female) and the estimated number of fathers ranging from 1 to 9 (mean +/- SE: 4.2 +/- 0.35 sires per female). The number of fathers per brood was positively correlated with brood size, but not with female size. Next, we calculated the reproductive skew per brood using the estimated number of sires, and found that in 21 out of the 27 multiply sired broods sires did not contribute equally to the offspring. Skew was not correlated with either female size, brood size or the number of sires per brood. Finally, we discuss several biological mechanisms that may influence multiple paternity and reproductive skew inP. gilliias well as in the Poeciliidae in general.","[Dekker, Myrthe L.; Hagmayer, Andres; Leon-Kloosterziel, Karen M.; Pollux, Bart J.

We evaluated whether fire injury increased susceptibility of lodgepole pines (Pinus contorta) to mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins), how it influenced beetle reproductive success, and whether beetle population phase altered this interaction. Eight sites that experienced wildfire and eight unburned sites were examined in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (USA). Half were in areas where D. ponderosae was undergoing outbreaks, and half were in areas with low populations. We examined 2056 trees one year after fire for burn injury and beetle attack. We quantified beetle reproductive success in a random sample of 106 trees, and measured gallery areas of D. ponderosae and competing subcortical herbivores in 79 additional trees. Baited flight traps sampled stand-level populations of Subcortical herbivores and predators. Wildfire predisposed trees to D. ponderosae attack, but nonlinearly, with moderately injured trees being most preferred. This tree-level interaction was influenced by stand-level beetle population size, in that both healthy and fire-injured trees of all classes were attacked where populations were high, but no healthy trees, and only low and moderately injured trees were killed where populations were low. The number of adult brood produced per female was likewise curvilinear, being highest in moderately injured trees. This reflected an apparent trade-off, with high intraspecific competition arising from the large number of beetles needed to overcome defenses in healthy trees, vs. high interspecific competition and low substrate quality in more injured trees. These results suggest that fire-injured trees can provide a reservoir for D. ponderosae during periods when populations are too low to overcome defenses of healthy trees, and might otherwise face localized extinction. However, the likelihood of populations increasing from endemic to outbreak levels in response to increased susceptibility is offset by the opposing constraints of lower substrate quality and higher competitor load in severely injured hosts, and the relative scarcity of moderately injured trees. Wildfire may confer some reproductive increases to populations already outbreaking. We present a conceptual model of how these disturbances and inherent feedbacks interact to affect beetle population dynamics.","[Powell, Erinn N.; Raffa, Kenneth F.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Russell Labs 345, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Powell, Erinn N.; Townsend, Philip A.; Raffa, Kenneth F.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Raffa, KF (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, Russell Labs 345, 1630 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",raffa@entomology.wisc.edu,"Townsend, Philip A/B-5741-2008","Townsend, Philip A/0000-0001-7003-8774",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0816541]; McIntire Stennis [WIS0469]; Joint Fire Sciences Program [06-2-1-20]; University of Wisconsin College of Agricultural and Life Sciences,"We thank the National Science Foundation DEB-0816541, McIntire Stennis WIS0469, Joint Fire Sciences Program 06-2-1-20, and University of Wisconsin College of Agricultural and Life Sciences for support.

Systematic variation of both-consistent with predictions derived from socioecology models-is well documented, but there is considerable variation within species and populations that is poorly understood. The mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei) is unusual because, despite possessing morphology associated with male contest competition (e.g., extreme sexual dimorphism), they are regularly observed in both single-male and multimale groups. Both male-female and male-infant bonds are strong because males provide protection against infanticide and/or predation. Risk of these threats varies with social structure, which may influence the strength of social relationships among group members (including females and offspring, if females with lower infant mortality risk are less protective of infants). Here, we investigate the relationship between group structure and the strength of proximity relationships between males and females, males and infants, and females and offspring. Data come from 10 social groups containing 1-7 adult males, monitored by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund's Karisoke Research Center in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda. After controlling for group size and infant age, association strength was similar for male-female pairs across group types with both dominant and nondominant males, but male-infant relationships were strongest in single-male groups where paternity certainty was high and animals had fewer social partners to choose from. The male:female and male:infant ratios better predicted both male-female and male-infant associations than the absolute number of males, females, or infants did. The fewer the number of males per female or infant, the more both pair types associated. Dominant males in groups containing fewer males had higher eigenvector centrality (a measure of importance in a social network) than dominant males in groups with more males. Results indicate that nondominant males are an important influence on relationships between dominant males and females/infants despite their peripheral social positions, and that relationships between males and infants must be considered an important foundation of gorilla social structure.","[Rosenbaum, S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Anthropol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Maldonado-Chaparro, A.

Sometimes, these habitat shifts coincide with an ontogenetic transition. These ontogenetic habitat shifts can allow species to access nutritional resources, avoid conspecific aggression or predation, or secure breeding opportunities when it is advantageous to do so. The Kermadec Islands giant limpet Scutellastra kermadecensis is a protandrous hermaphrodite endemic to Rangitahua, the Kermadec Islands. These limpets have an unusual habit whereby small limpets (piggies) piggy-back on the shells of larger individuals rather than living on the rocky substrate. We investigated whether the ontogenetic habitat shift between the piggy-backing and rock-attached limpets was determined by the availability of free space on the rock or whether the ontogenetic habitat shift was a response to the properties of the surrounding limpet population. We found that the available rock space did not influence the size at which an individual transitioned from being a piggy to being rock-attached. Furthermore, larger rock-attached limpets were more likely to have piggies, they had more piggies, and the piggies were larger. Overall, our results suggest that Kermadec giant limpets are motivated to piggy-back by the properties of the social environment rather than space constraints. The piggy-backing behaviour may be a mechanism to avoid bulldozing by larger limpets, to access grazing opportunities on the shells of larger limpets, and/or to monopolise breeding opportunities with larger rock-attached females. We discuss the repercussions of this life-history strategy for this extremely range-restricted species, with reference to how these populations may be monitored and maintained.","[Kim, Julia J.

When abundant, gelatinous zooplankton can induce trophic cascades as well as alter energy flows to upper-level consumers. To quantify the role water temperature plays in regulating bloom development of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi in subtropical coastal waters, we experimentally determined the effects of increases in temperature and rates of warming on growth rate (mg C d(-1)). Conditions were representative of those occurring during late winter and early spring (January to April) in the northern Gulf of Mexico. M. leidyi growth rates increased exponentially with temperature (9, 13, 16, and 22 degrees C) and rates of warming (+1, +2, and +3 degrees C wk(-1)). A biologically important temperature threshold (15.0 degrees C, delineating negative and positive growth) as a proxy measure for bloom initiation was applied to a time-series of sea surface temperature (1975 to 2013) from Mobile Bay (Alabama, USA) and indicated climate-related warming of northern Gulf of Mexico has likely advanced the timing of the spring M. leidyi bloom over the past 39 yr. Results have implications for ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management since larger ctenophore blooms, occurring earlier in the year, would be expected to intensify potential competitive and predatory interactions between M. leidyi, zooplankton, and planktivorous juvenile fish utilizing nearshore waters as nursery habitat during the late winter and early spring.","[Robinson, Kelly L.] Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA; [Robinson, Kelly L.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, Mobile, AL 36688 USA; [Graham, William M.] Univ So Mississippi, Dept Marine Sci, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39529 USA","Robinson, KL (corresponding author), Univ So Mississippi, Dept Marine Sci, 1020 Balch Blvd, Stennis Space Ctr, MS 39529 USA.",kelly.l.robinson@usm.edu,,,Dauphin Island Sea Lab Graduate Fellowship; University of South Alabama Marine Sciences Graduate Fellowship,"The authors thank Renee Collini for assisting with the field work and Keith Bayha for providing comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Signal plasticity enables males to enhance conspicuous signals to impress mates and competitors and to reduce signal expression to lower energetic and predation-related signaling costs when competition is low. While signal plasticity may benefit the signaler, it can compromise the reliability of the information conveyed by the signals. In this paper we review the effect of signal plasticity on the reliability of the electrocommunication signal of the gymnotiform fish Brachyhypopomus gauderio. We (1) summarize the endocrine regulation of signal plasticity, (2) explore the regulation of signal plasticity in females, (3) examine the information conveyed by the signal, (4) show how that information changes when the signal changes, and (5) consider the energetic strategies used to sustain expensive signaling. The electric organ discharge (EOD) of B. gauderio changes in response to social environment on two time scales. Two hormone classes, melanocortins and androgens, underlie the short-term and long-term modulation of signal amplitude and duration observed during social interaction. Population density drives signal amplitude enhancement, unexpectedly improving the reliability with which the signal predicts the signaler's size. The signal's second phase elongation predicts androgen levels and male reproductive condition. Males sustain signal enhancement with dietary intake, but when food is limited, they 'go for broke' and put extra energy into electric signals. Cortisol diminishes EOD parameters, but energy-limited males offset cortisol effects by boosting androgen levels. While physiological constraints are sufficient to maintain signal amplitude reliability, phenotypic integration and signaling costs maintain reliability of signal duration, consistent with theory of honest signaling.","[Gavassa, Sat; Goldina, Anna; Stoddard, Philip K.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Silva, Ana C.] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias, Lab Neurociencias, Montevideo 11800, Uruguay; [Silva, Ana C.] Inst Invest Biol Clemente Estable, Unidad Bases Neur Conducta, Montevideo 11600, Uruguay","Gavassa, S (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",sgava001@fiu.edu,"Stoddard, Philip K/AAY-4188-2020",,Tinker Field Research Grants (LACC at FIU); University Graduate School's Dissertation Evidence Acquisition Fellowship; Dissertation Year Fellowship; Judith Evans Scholarship; Animal Behavior Society; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [MBRS RISE R25 GM061347]; Graduate Student Association Research Grant; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS 0956603]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0956603] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R25GM061347] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This work was supported by Tinker Field Research Grants (LACC at FIU), University Graduate School's Dissertation Evidence Acquisition Fellowship, Dissertation Year Fellowship, Judith Evans Scholarship for travel, Animal Behavior Society award to S.

Robust ecological information on the factors influencing selection and patterns of use of nesting sites, and a comprehensive multi-scale framework for the collection and analysis of nesting data, are essential for assessing the effects of introduced cavity nesters on communities of native cavity nesters. The native avifauna of New Zealand lacks primary cavity-excavators, and is now host to a suite of introduced cavity-nesting birds that may compete for suitable nesting sites. For most of these introduced species, however, data on nesting-site use are lacking. We studied the nesting ecology of the most successful psittacine invader, the Eastern Rosella (Platycercus eximius), in the North Island. Rosella nest-site use was investigated at the microhabitat, macrohabitat, and landscape scales. The number of potential nesting sites available in an area and proximity to fresh water were important determinants of occupancy of nest sites by Rosellas. In urban areas where mature, cavity-bearing trees were rare, Rosellas were observed using alternative nesting sites in tree ferns. This apparent flexibility in nesting behaviour may have contributed to the success and spread of Eastern Rosellas within New Zealand.","[Galbraith, Josie A.; Clout, Mick N.] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Hauber, Mark E.] CUNY, Hunter Coll, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Hauber, Mark E.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10065 USA","Galbraith, JA (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",jgal026@aucklanduni.ac.nz,,"Clout, Mick/0000-0003-2864-4628; Galbraith, Josie/0000-0003-3869-7977",Auckland Regional Council; University of Auckland; Ornithological Society of New Zealand,"We express our gratitude to the Auckland Regional Council, the University of Auckland and the Ornithological Society of New Zealand for funding this study.

How chemical cues can alter communicating interactions where the transmitters of chemical cues do not participate is poorly understood. Chemical information plays an important role in the sexual behaviour of urodeles. Previous studies of the newt Lissotriton boscai and other salamandrids showed that males modify their courtship in presence of competitors to avoid courtship interferences. The aim of this study was to test whether L. boscai males assess the level of competition through chemical cues and adjust their courtship accordingly. In a first experiment, male courtship displays were recorded in aquaria containing their own chemical stimuli, or from another male. The duration and/or the number of several courtship displays were scored, and found that males decreased their courtship effort when the water contained chemical stimuli from another male. This experiment showed that semiochemicals can be sufficient to modify courtship displays without visual contact with transmitters of the chemical information, suggesting that males may adjust their courtship display to reduce reproductive costs. An additional experiment resembling chemically mediated residence asymmetries was then performed to examine whether territoriality is compatible with results of experiment 1, and found no evidence.","CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Evolut, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Aragon, P (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Evolut, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",paragon@mncn.csic.es,"Aragon, Pedro/B-2598-2009","Aragon, Pedro/0000-0002-6849-7274",Consegeria de Medio Ambiente [I3P-PC2005L],"Financial support was provided to P.

In understanding the success of complex animal societies, task differentiation has been identified as a central mechanism underlying the emergence and performance of adaptive collective behaviors. In this study, we explore how individual differences in behavior and body size determine task allocation in the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola. We found that individuals with high body condition indices were less likely to participate in prey capture, and individuals' tendency to engage in prey capture was not associated with either their behavioral traits or body size. No traits were associated with individuals' propensity to participation in web repair, but small individuals were more likely to engage in standard web-building. We also discovered consistent, differences among colonies in their collective behavior (i.e., colony-level personality). At the colony level, within-colony variation in behavior (aggressiveness) and body size were positively associated with aggressive foraging behavior. Together, our findings reveal a subtly complex relationship between individual variation and collective behavior in this species. We close by comparing the relationship between individual variation and social organization in nine species of social spider. We conclude that intraspecific variation is a major force behind the social organization of multiple independently derived lineages of social spider.","[Keiser, Carl N.; Jones, Devin K.; Modlmeier, Andreas P.; Pruitt, Jonathan N.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Keiser, CN (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",cnk21@pitt.edu,"Keiser, Carl/AAH-1873-2021; Modlmeier, Andreas/H-3463-2019","Keiser, Carl/0000-0002-4936-7810; Modlmeier, Andreas/0000-0002-3095-488X; Pruitt, Jonathan/0000-0003-0326-6755; Singh, Nishant/0000-0002-8262-5690",University of PittsburghUniversity of Pittsburgh; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF IOS 1352705],"We thank F.

Treatment pools containing low (five snails) or high (10 snails) densities of either infected or uninfected trematode vector Pseudosuccinea columella were compared with control pools containing no P. columella. Treatments had significant effects on the number of gray treefrog eggs deposited in pools. Compared to control pools, fewer eggs were laid in all treatment pools, either because fewer pairs laid eggs, or fewer eggs were laid per visit. Pools containing infected P. columella also had fewer eggs deposited relative to pools containing uninfected P. columella. The gray treefrog, H. versicolor, can discriminate between oviposition sites, based on the species present and the potential for infection. Choice of oviposition site can be a mechanism that determines the composition of ecological communities as well as influencing parental reproductive success.

Using 2301 tracking points from 59 individualxmonth combinations, we calculated activity area size and shape, daily movement rate and monthly displacement distance. Results Activity area size and daily movement rate were lower in the linear remnants compared to the large rectangular remnant and increased with body size. Activity area linearity increased in linear remnants for larger animals only. Monthly displacement distance did not vary according to tree cover or body size. Conclusions Dragons reduced their movement in linear remnants that have higher resource availability. Larger animals were more affected by landscape configuration as the dimensions of their normal activity areas exceeded the typical widths of the linear remnants. Future studies of animal movement in production landscapes will benefit from incorporating measures of resource availability, body size and landscape configuration to test predictions derived from theory.","[Doherty, Tim S.; Fist, Charles N.; Driscoll, Don A.] Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood Campus, Geelong, Vic, Australia","Doherty, TS (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood Campus, Geelong, Vic, Australia.",tim.doherty.0@gmail.com,"Doherty, Tim S./G-9354-2015","Doherty, Tim S./0000-0001-7745-0251; Driscoll, Don/0000-0002-1560-5235",Australian Academy of Science's Margaret Middleton Fund Award; Deakin University's Centre for Integrative Ecology,"This research was generously funded by the Australian Academy of Science's Margaret Middleton Fund Award and Deakin University's Centre for Integrative Ecology.

The same principles that contribute to the evolutionary success of venoms, contribute to making the study of venoms of great interest in such diverse fields as evolutionary ecology and biotechnology. Evolution is profoundly contingent, and nature also reinvents itself continuosly. Changes in a complex phenotypic trait, such as venom, reflect the influences of prior evolutionary history, chance events, and selection. Reconstructing the natural history of venoms, particularly those of snakes, which will be dealt with in more detail in this review, requires the integration of different levels of knowledge into a meaningful and comprehensive evolutionary framework for separating stochastic changes from adaptive evolution. The application of omics technologies and other disciplines have contributed to a qualitative and quantitative advance in the road map towards this goal. In this review we will make a foray into the world of animal venoms, discuss synergies and complementarities of the different approaches used in their study, and identify current bottlenecks that prevent inferring the evolutionary mechanisms and ecological constraints that molded snake venoms to their present-day variability landscape.","[Calvete, Juan J.] CSIC, Inst Biomed Valencia, Struct & Funct Venom Lab, Valencia, Spain","Calvete, JJ (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Biomed Valencia, Struct & Funct Venom Lab, Valencia, Spain.",jcalvete@ibv.csic.es,"Calvete, Juan/P-2555-2019; Calvete, Juan J/K-9619-2014","Calvete, Juan/0000-0001-5026-3122; Calvete, Juan J/0000-0001-5026-3122","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Madrid, Spain [BFU2013-42833-P]","Recent research conducted in the author's laboratory has supported by grant [BFU2013-42833-P] from the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Madrid, Spain.",,276,81,81,0,63,PORTLAND PRESS LTD,LONDON,"CHARLES DARWIN HOUSE, 12 ROGER STREET, LONDON WC1N 2JU, ENGLAND",0264-6021,1470-8728,,BIOCHEM J,Biochem.

The population of three-lips in Lake Biwa has decreased, primarily due to habitat degradation and introduction by competitive, non-native predators, such as largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). However, the effects of bass introduction on the three-lips are unclear. We investigated the food habits of the three-lips and compared them with those of sympatric non-native largemouth bass in Lake Biwa. A total of 145 three-lips and 178 largemouth bass were sampled during the summer and fall of 2013. Fish prey, particularly ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis), was predominant in the three-lips diet, followed by terrestrial insects. Decapods (i.e., prawn and shrimp), ayu and demersal fish (e.g., gobids) composed a substantial proportion of bass diets. No significant dietary overlaps were found between the two predators. Our results suggest that differences in food habits between the two species may result from differences in feeding behavior; the three-lips is a mobile predator that forages mainly on nektonic and suspended food, whereas largemouth bass is an ambush predator that forages on both nektonic and benthic prey. We referred the results of three-lips diets in Lake Biwa in a previous study and suggest that changes in fish fauna, due to introduction by non-native largemouth bass, may have affected prey availability for the three-lips.","[Tsunoda, Hiroshi] Gifu Univ, Res Ctr Wildlife Management, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Tsunoda, Hiroshi] Ctr Environm Sci Saitama, Kazo, Saitama 3470115, Japan; [Urano, Takahiro; Ohira, Mitsuru] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Grad Sch Agr, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan","Tsunoda, H (corresponding author), Gifu Univ, Res Ctr Wildlife Management, Yanagido 1-1, Gifu 5011193, Japan.",tsunoda.hiroshi@gmail.com,"Tsunoda, Hiroshi/L-2974-2019","Tsunoda, Hiroshi/0000-0001-6214-5625","SUMASUI Nature Conservation Foundation; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [25740049]",We are grateful to students of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology for their field assistance.

The mechanistic basis of tolerance, which involve defensive mechanisms minimizing parasite damage after a successful parasitic attack, remains poorly explored in the study of cuckoo-host interactions. Here, we experimentally explore the possibility that the risk of great spotted cuckoo Clamator glandarius parasitism may induce tolerance defences in magpie Pica pica hosts through plasticity in life-history traits. We predict that magpies exposed to auditory cues indicating high parasitism risk will more likely exhibit resistance and/or modify their life-history traits to minimize parasitism costs (i.e. tolerance) compared to magpies under low parasitism risk. We found that manipulating the perceived parasitism risk did not affect host resistance (i.e. rejection of parasitic eggs) nor host life-history traits. Unexpectedly, host's egg volume increased over the season in nests exposed to auditory cues of control non-harmful hoopoes Upupa epops. Our results do not provide support for inducible defences (either based on resistance or tolerance) in response to risk of parasitism in magpie hosts. Even so, we encourage studying plastic expression of breeding strategies in response to risk of cuckoo parasitism to achieve a better understanding of the mechanistic basis of tolerance defences.","[Exposito-Granados, Monica; Parejo, Deseada; Aviles, Jesus M.] EEZA CSIC, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Almeria, Spain; [Parejo, Deseada] Univ Extremadura, Dept Zool, Badajoz, Spain; [Martinez, Juan Gabriel; Sanchez-Tojar, Alfredo; Precioso, Marta; Molina-Morales, Mercedes] Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Granada, Spain; [Sanchez-Tojar, Alfredo] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Evolutionary Biol Grp, Seewiesen, Germany","Exposito-Granados, M (corresponding author), EEZA CSIC, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Almeria, Spain.",moexposit@eeza.csic.es,"Molina-Morales, Mercedes/I-8397-2019; Martinez, Juan Gabriel/L-9471-2014; Exposito-Granados, Monica/K-1863-2019; Aviles, Jesus/K-3332-2014; Parejo, Deseada/L-3953-2014; Sanchez-Tojar, Alfredo/H-3619-2019","Martinez, Juan Gabriel/0000-0001-5277-4620; Exposito-Granados, Monica/0000-0002-7996-2469; Aviles, Jesus/0000-0002-1463-8393; Parejo, Deseada/0000-0002-7368-2378; Sanchez-Tojar, Alfredo/0000-0002-2886-0649; Precioso, Marta/0000-0002-2030-5966; Molina Morales, Mercedes/0000-0001-8669-6624","Spanish Ministry of Education and Science/FEDERSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2011-27561/BOS, CGL2014-56769-P]; Government of Extremadura [TA13002]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2012-051898]","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science/FEDER (Projects CGL2011-27561/BOS and CGL2014-56769-P to D.

NOV.; SUBINHIBITORY CONCENTRATIONS; FAMILY VERRUCOMICROBIACEAE; PHYLUM VERRUCOMICROBIA; ANTIBIOTIC PRODUCTION,"Marine sediments harbor complex microbial communities that remain poorly studied relative to other biomes such as seawater. Moreover, bacteria in these communities produce antibiotics and other bioactive secondary metabolites, yet little is known about how these compounds affect microbial community structure. In this study, we used next-generation amplicon sequencing to assess native microbial community composition in shallow tropical marine sediments. The results revealed complex communities comprised of largely uncultured taxa, with considerable spatial heterogeneity and known antibiotic producers comprising only a small fraction of the total diversity. Organic extracts from cultured strains of the sedimentdwelling actinomycete genus Salinispora were then used in mesocosm studies to address how secondary metabolites shape sediment community composition. We identified predatory bacteria and other taxa that were consistently reduced in the extract-treated mesocosms, suggesting that they may be the targets of allelopathic interactions. We tested related taxa for extract sensitivity and found general agreement with the culture-independent results. Conversely, several taxa were enriched in the extract-treated mesocosms, suggesting that some bacteria benefited from the interactions. The results provide evidence that bacterial secondary metabolites can have complex and significant effects on sediment microbial communities. IMPORTANCE Ocean sediments represent one of Earth's largest and most poorly studied biomes. These habitats are characterized by complex microbial communities where competition for space and nutrients can be intense. This study addressed the hypothesis that secondary metabolites produced by the sediment-inhabiting actinomycete Salinispora arenicola affect community composition and thus mediate interactions among competing microbes. Next-generation amplicon sequencing of mesocosm experiments revealed complex communities that shifted following exposure to S. arenicola extracts. The results reveal that certain predatory bacteria were consistently less abundant following exposure to extracts, suggesting that microbial metabolites mediate competitive interactions. Other taxa increased in relative abundance, suggesting a benefit from the extracts themselves or the resulting changes in the community. This study takes a first step toward assessing the impacts of bacterial metabolites on sediment microbial communities. The results provide insight into how low-abundance organisms may help structure microbial communities in ocean sediments.","[Patin, Nastassia V.; Schorn, Michelle; Moore, Bradley S.; Jensen, Paul R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Marine Biotechnol & Biomed, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Aguinaldo, Kristen; Lincecum, Tommie] Ion Torrent Thermo Fisher Sci, Carlsbad, CA USA; [Moore, Bradley S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA USA; [Moore, Bradley S.; Jensen, Paul R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Microbiome Innovat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Jensen, PR (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Marine Biotechnol & Biomed, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.; Jensen, PR (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Ctr Microbiome Innovat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",pjensen@ucsd.edu,"schorn, michelle/AAD-6284-2020","jensen, paul/0000-0003-2349-1888; Moore, Bradley/0000-0002-4652-1253","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-1235142]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01-GM085770, U19-TW007401-01]; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [U19TW007401] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM085770] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Directorate For GeosciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1235142] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (OCE-1235142) and the National Institutes of Health (R01-GM085770 and U19-TW007401-01).,,97,16,16,3,21,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0099-2240,1098-5336,,APPL ENVIRON MICROB,Appl.

Diet quality and handling affect the intrinsic qualities of body size/ condition and stress, respectively. Presence of prey and diet quality of opponents are extrinsic factors. Unstressed larvae on high-quality diets bit their high-condition opponents more frequently than those that had been on low-quality diets in both the presence and absence of food. Stressed larvae (all on high quality diets) showed low levels of biting when food was absent. However, when food was present, the level of biting depended on the diet quality of their opponents: stressed larvae bit opponents on low-quality diets more than opponents on high-quality diets. Overall, both intrinsic and extrinsic factors influenced interference behaviour, with larvae on high-quality diets exhibiting relatively high levels of biting unless they had experienced handling stress, and the effect of handling stress depending on the condition of the opponent in paired interactions.","[Heuring, Courtney A.; Heuring, Whitney L.; Mathis, Alicia] Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, 901 S Natl Ave, Springfield, MO 65807 USA; [Crane, Adam L.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, 112 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada","Mathis, A (corresponding author), Missouri State Univ, Dept Biol, 901 S Natl Ave, Springfield, MO 65807 USA.",AliciaMathis@MissouriState.edu,,,,,,44,0,0,0,11,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0173-5373,1568-5381,,AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA,Amphib.

However, some predators focus their search in certain plant regions, and herbivores tend to select leaves to balance their nutrient uptake and exposure to plant defenses. Individual-based models that account for heterogeneous within-plant predator-prey interactions can be used to scale-up functional responses, but they would require the generation of explicit prey spatial distributions within-plant architecture models. The silverleaf whitefly, Bemisia tabaci biotype B (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), is a significant pest of tomato crops worldwide that exhibits highly aggregated populations at several spatial scales, including within the plant. As part of an analytical framework to understand predator-silverleaf whitefly interactions, the objective of this research was to develop an algorithm to generate explicit spatial counts of silverleaf whitefly nymphs within tomato plants. The algorithm requires the plant size and the number of silverleaf whitefly individuals to distribute as inputs, and includes models that describe infestation probabilities per leaf nodal position and the aggregation pattern of the silverleaf whitefly within tomato plants and leaves. The output is a simulated number of silverleaf whitefly individuals for each leaf and leaflet on one or more plants. Parameter estimation was performed using nymph counts per leaflet censused from 30 artificially infested tomato plants. Validation revealed a substantial agreement between algorithm outputs and independent data that included the distribution of counts of both eggs and nymphs. This algorithmcan be used in simulation models that explore the effect of local heterogeneity on whitefly-predator dynamics.","[Rincon, Diego F.; Hoy, Casey W.; Canas, Luis A.] Ohio State Univ, Ohio Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Dept Entomol, Wooster, OH 44691 USA; [Hoy, Casey W.] Ohio State Univ, Ohio Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Agroecosyst Management Program, Wooster, OH 44691 USA","Hoy, CW (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Ohio Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Dept Entomol, 1680 Madison Ave, Wooster, OH 44691 USA.",hoy.1@osu.edu,,"Rincon, Diego/0000-0001-6869-4430","Corpoica; ColcienciasDepartamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias; Fulbright Program; Department of Entomology at The Ohio State University; Ohio State University, Ohio Agricultural Research and Development CenterOhio State University [OHOA1006]; U.S. Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA)","We thank Dr. Robin A.

Competition is the major biotic and nutrient availability a major abiotic component of a plant's growth environment. Yet, surprisingly few studies have investigated impacts of competition and nutrient availability on herbivore performance and reciprocal herbivore effects on plants. We studied growth of the specialist aphid, Macrosiphoniella tanacetaria, and its host plant tansy, Tanacetum vulgare, under experimental addition of inorganic and organic fertilizer crossed with competition by goldenrod, Solidago canadensis. Because of evidence that competition by goldenrod is mediated by allelopathic compounds, we also added a treatment with activated carbon. Results showed that fertilization increased, and competition with goldenrod decreased, plant biomass, but this was likely mediated by resource competition. There was no evidence from the activated carbon treatment that allelopathy played a role which instead had a fertilizing effect. Aphid performance increased with higher plant biomass and depended on plant growth conditions, with fertilization and AC increasing, and plant competition decreasing aphid numbers. Feedbacks of aphids on plant performance interacted with plant growth conditions in complex ways depending on the relative magnitude of the effects on plant biomass and aphid numbers. In the basic fertilization treatment, tansy plants profited from increased nutrient availability by accumulating more biomass than they lost due to an increased number of aphids under fertilization. When adding additional fertilizer, aphid numbers increased so high that tansy plants suffered and showed reduced biomass compared with controls without aphids. Thus, the ecological cost of an infestation with aphids depends on the balance of effects of growth conditions on plant and herbivore performance. These results emphasize the importance to investigate both perspectives in plant herbivore interactions and characterize the effects of growth conditions on plant and herbivore performance and their respective feedbacks.","[Mahdavi-Arab, Nafiseh] Univ Jena, Inst Ecol, Jena, Germany; [Mahdavi-Arab, Nafiseh; Meyer, Sebastian T.; Weisser, Wolfgang W.] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Mehrparvar, Mohsen] Grad Univ Adv Technol, Inst Sci & High Technol & Environm Sci, Dept Biodivers, Kerman, Iran","Meyer, ST (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Terr Ecol Res Grp, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",sebastian.t.meyer@tum.de,"Meyer, Sebastian Tobias/AAH-3856-2021; Weisser, Wolfgang W/B-9718-2014","Meyer, Sebastian Tobias/0000-0003-0833-1472; Weisser, Wolfgang W/0000-0002-2757-8959; Mehrparvar, Mohsen/0000-0002-6051-5845",TUM Diversity Scholarship; German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); Technische Universitat Munchen;  [WE 3081/15-2],"This study was financially supported by grant WE 3081/15-2 and by a TUM Diversity Scholarship to NMA.

An array of independent T4-resistant mutants, derived from a single ancestral strain of E. coli B, had a mean reduction in competitive fitness that depended strongly on environmental temperature; the cost of resistance generally increased with temperature. Genetic variance for fitness among phage-resistant mutants also depended on temperature; however, genetic variance increased at high and low thermal extremes. These results suggest that temperature is likely to be an important determinant of the consequences of predation in natural communities. We also discuss the underlying mechanistic basis for the cost of resistance in this system and its interaction with temperature.","[Quance, Michael A.] Univ Houston, Texas Learning & Computat Ctr, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77004 USA","Quance, MA (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Texas Learning & Computat Ctr, Dept Biol & Biochem, Houston, TX 77004 USA.",mquance@bioinfo.uh.edu,"Travisano, Michael/AAI-4809-2020","Travisano, Michael/0000-0001-8168-0842",,,,81,24,24,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,JUN,2009,63,6,,,,,1406,1416,,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00654.x,,,11,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,448MZ,WOS:000266268000002,19222568,Bronze,,,2021-09-27,

The emphasis of most empirical work on plasticity has been on examining coarse-grained variation with the goal of understanding the costs and benefits of plastic responses in response to a particular environment. In this study, we investigated the effects of fine-grained variation in predation on the inducible defences of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) by widely altering the density and feeding schedule of caged predators (Dytiscus spp.) while holding average predation constant. We found that predator cues induced change in tadpole behaviour, morphology, and mass. Surprisingly, however, temporal variation in predation did not cause the tadpoles to alter their activity (compared to a constant predation treatment) or mass. Temporal variation in predation did alter tadpole tail depth, but only when experiencing our most extreme variation treatment in which the predators were fed once every 8 days. Under these conditions, the predator-induced tadpole tail was less extreme compared to environments containing constant predation. While a number of previous studies have examined behavioural responses of prey to temporal variation in predation risk without holding average predation constant, this appears to be the first test of temporal variation per se. As in previous studies of organism responses to temporal variation in resources, our results suggest that fine-grained environmental variability can affect the expression of phenotypically plastic traits, but our tadpoles appear to be generally unresponsive to this fine-grained variation for many of their traits.","[Schoeppner, Nancy M.; Relyea, Rick A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Relyea, RA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",relyea@pitt.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); G.

However, it is difficult to make mechanistic inferences because several confounding factors, such as food deprivation levels, food availability, neighbor distance, and group size can mask or amplify spatial position effects. We attempted to address experimentally the effect of spatial position on foraging and vigilance in a group, controlling for many confounding factors. We used enclosures that restricted physical but not visual interactions between brown-headed cowbirds and manipulated spatial position, flock size, and neighbor distance. Pecking rate (number of pecks per trial duration) was not related with position, but instantaneous pecking rate (number of pecks per foraging bout duration) was higher at the edge. The proportion of time spent head-up (scanning and food-handling) was also higher at the edge. For pecking rate and proportion of time spent scanning, changes in neighbor distance influenced the behavior of edge birds to a lesser extent than central birds. These results suggest that cowbirds at the edge perceived greater predation risk and that during the limited foraging time available, edge birds tried to compensate by foraging at a faster rate.","[Fernandez-Juricic, Esteban] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Beauchamp, Guy] Univ Montreal, Fac Vet Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Fernandez-Juricic, E (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, 1250 Bellflower Blvd Mailstop 3702, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",efernand@csulb.edu,,,,,,55,19,19,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,FEB,2008,114,2,,,,,105,114,,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2007.01433.x,,,10,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,251SC,WOS:000252393300001,,,,,2021-09-27,

The frequency of cannibalism decreased with increasing alternative prey densities. No significant difference in damselfly growth rate was found between intermediate and high alternative prey densities, but larvae with the lowest alternative prey densities grew more slowly. This pattern is attributed to cannibalism. Cannibals should have gained extra nutrients from consuming conspecifics. In addition cannibalism might have decreased exploitation competition at intermediate prey densities. In fact, some of the largest individuals from intermediate prey densities grew as fast or faster than the smallest individuals in the high alternative prey treatments. Individuals that were cannibals early were larger at the end of the experiment than late cannibals. Also, individuals that ate several conspecifics were larger at the end the experiment.

This simple spatial structure suffices to explain the observations that (1) natural Daphnia-algae systems tend to be relatively stable up to high nutrient values, and that (2) in the presence of Daphnia edible algae do increase with enrichment. Additionally, the model trivially explains confusing observations of oscillating Daphnia densities in the presence of a practically constant density of edible algae. The model is supported by the results of a laboratory experiment with a cascade of zooplankton-phytoplankton containers, devised originally to test ratio-dependent foraging.

Although top-down drivers of change have received particular focus, we still have little understanding of how consistently these factors control an ecosystem's shift in both directions, between different ecosystem states. Using a crossed experiment in a shallow embayment in southeastern Australia, we investigated the roles of disturbance (kelp removal) and sea urchin herbivory (via increased density) to determine their contributions to shifts away from a kelp-dominated community. In a second experiment, done in urchin barren areas at two sites, we tested whether reductions in ambient sea urchin densities allowed an algal shift in the reverse direction. In both experiments, we observed that high densities of sea urchins could negatively influence kelp and macroalgal abundance. However, in the kelp bed, a moderate or severe disturbance resulted in a comparable algal response, irrespective of urchin density. The influence of sea urchins also varied dramatically between the two urchin barren sites. Here, reducing urchin densities resulted in algal recovery at one site, but at the other site, substantial colonisation of barren areas by canopy-forming brown algae and Ulvales occurred across all (low, medium, and high) urchin density treatments. Our findings illustrate multiple pathways of urchin barren creation and algal recovery, and reveal that shifts both to and from an urchin barren state can occur irrespective of herbivore pressure. These alternate pathways can operate over short spatial distances or with different regimes of disturbance.","[Carnell, Paul E.; Keough, Michael J.] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Carnell, Paul E.] Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia","Carnell, PE (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.; Carnell, PE (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",paul.carnell@deakin.edu.au,,,Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Jasper Loftus-Hills award; Australian Postgraduate AwardAustralian Government,"We thank R.

Human interests often conflict with those of wildlife. In the coastal zone humans often exploit shellfish populations that would otherwise provide food for populations of shorebirds (Charadrii). There has been considerable debate on the consequences of shellfishing for the survival of shorebirds, and conversely the effects of shorebird predation on the shellfish stocks remaining for human exploitation. Until now, it has been difficult to determine the impact of current shellfishery practices on birds or to investigate how possible alternative policies would affect their survival and numbers. 2. One long-running contentious issue has been how to manage mussel Mytilus edulis and cockle Cerastoderma edule shellfisheries in a way that has least effect on a co-dependent shorebird, the oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, which also consumes these shellfish. This study used a behaviour-based model to explore the effects that the present-day management regimes of a mussel (Exe estuary, UK) and a cockle (Burry inlet, UK) fishery have on the survival and numbers of overwintering oystercatchers. It also explored how alternative regimes might affect the birds. 3. The model includes depletion and disturbance as two possibly detrimental effects of shellfishing and some of the longer-term effects on shellfish stocks. Importantly, model birds respond to shellfishing in the same ways as real birds. They increase the time spent feeding at low tide and feed in fields and upshore areas at other times. When shellfishing removes the larger prey, birds eat more smaller prey. 4. The results suggest that, currently, neither shellfishery causes oystercatcher mortality to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of shellfishing; at present intensities, shellfishing does not significantly affect the birds. However, they also show that changes in management practices, such as increasing fishing effort, reducing the minimum size of shellfish collected or increasing the daily quota, can greatly affect oystercatcher mortality and population size, and that the detrimental effect of shellfishing can be greatly increased by periods of cold weather or when prey are unusually scarce. By providing quantitative predictions of bird survival and numbers of a range of alternative shellfishery management regimes, the model can guide management policy in these and other estuaries.","Ctr Ecol & Hydrol Dorset, Winfrith Technol Ctr, Dorchester DT2 8ZD, Dorset, England; Univ Reading, Sch Anim & Microbial Sci, Reading RG6 6AJ, Berks, England; Royal Soc Protect Birds, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, England; Alterra, NL-1790 AD Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands; Netherlands Inst Sea Res, NL-1790 AB Den Burg, Netherlands; SMACOPI, RN Baie de Somme, F-80100 Abbeville, France","Stillman, RA (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol Dorset, Winfrith Technol Ctr, Winfrith Newburgh, Dorchester DT2 8ZD, Dorset, England.",,"Stillman, Richard/B-6018-2009; van der Meer, Jaap/C-6687-2011",,,,,30,79,83,0,23,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

In addition to this, under microcosm conditions with potato tubers, we found at low infestation level that the effectiveness of the predatory mite varied from 72.50 +/- 28.50 to 100%, 28 days later, according to the release rate of mites. Under high infestation level, the effectiveness of biological control of the pest varied from 53.36 +/- 25.55 to 92.51 +/- 7.88%, also according to the release rate of the mites.

This is especially true in cropping systems experiments in which multiple management practices differ between experimental cropping system treatments. We conducted a cropping systems experiment in central Pennsylvania, USA, to analyze the effects of initial cover crop and tillage intensity on feed grain and forage crop productivity during the transition to organic production. We hypothesized that treatment effects of (1) tillage intensity (full or reduced); and (2) initial cover crops (annual rye (Secale cereale) or timothy/clover (Phleum pratense/Trifolium pratense)) on grain crop yield in a 3-year cover crop/soybean (Glycine max)/corn (Zea mays) rotation would be mediated by key agroecosystem function indicators (soil quality, weed pressure, and predatory arthropod activity). We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to attribute yield variation to treatment effects and abiotic factors as mediated by these ecosystem functions. We found that tillage intensity had both direct and indirect effects on corn yields. Full tillage had a direct, positive effect on corn yields, a negative effect on perennial weed density, and negative effect on a soil quality indicator (labile soil carbon). Full tillage also had an indirect effect on corn yields as mediated by perennial weed density. The initial cover crop influenced predatory arthropod activity-density and perennial weeds in year 2 (soybean phase), but had no effects in year 3 (corn phase). Abiotic and site factors influenced crop yields and other ecosystem functions in both rotation years. Our results highlight the utility of analytical approaches that consider the relationships among agroecosystem components. Through the analysis of management effects on multiple ecosystem functions, our results indicate that managing weed populations through tillage in organic systems can have the strongest effect on crop yields, although short-term profit gains may be at the expense of long-term loss in soil quality and beneficial insect conservation.

The accidental or deliberate release of alien species may be very disruptive to native biota, principally through competition or predation. Naturalized populations of mute swans Cygnus olor in western Europe and North America have overgrazed native aquatic vegetation, competed with other waterbirds, and damaged arable and fodder crops. Numbers may be controlled by destroying or oiling a proportion of eggs in each clutch to prevent hatching (clutch reduction). 2. A difference equation model was used to examine the effectiveness of clutch reduction on a mute swan population in the Wylye Valley, Wiltshire, UK. Model parameters were derived mainly from a long-term study of individually marked birds. Survival and emigration were parameterized as a combined function. The model focused on the non-breeding subpopulation, considered to have a negative impact on local fisheries by overgrazing aquatic macrophytes. 3. The model was also parameterized for another swan population in the West Midlands, UK. This population was characterized by rapid growth in a much larger area, compared with the smaller, comparatively stable population in the Wylye Valley. There were insufficient data available to parameterize accurately the model for other areas. 4. Annual survival rates were high in both populations, ranging between 68% and 73% for juveniles, first-years and non-breeding adults, and between 72% and 90% for breeding adults. Immigration was an important factor in the dynamics of both populations. 5. The effects of different levels of clutch reduction on the Wylye Valley mute swan population were simulated. Reducing clutches to two eggs per clutch lowered non-breeding numbers by 30% over a 10-year period. Total destruction of all eggs in each clutch stabilized the non-breeding subpopulation but did not eradicate it. The effects of clutch reduction were offset by high survival rates and immigration. 6. In the West Midlands, the simulated restriction of clutches to two eggs stabilized the non-breeding subpopulation but did not affect breeding numbers. Total destruction of all eggs in each clutch markedly reduced the non-breeding subpopulation. However, immigration was underestimated in this model and may have further diluted the effects of total egg destruction. 7. Synthesis and applications . Clutch reduction is labour intensive, requires persistence to be effective, and its effects may vary between populations depending on immigration rates. An evaluation of the consequences of clutch reduction in advance of implementation in the field is therefore highly desirable. The population model described in this study provides the means to do this. This study has demonstrated that control of breeding output did not alleviate a localized conflict, in this case overgrazing by swans in rivers. Deterrent measures and habitat management at the site of conflict may be more effective. The model permits the exploration of a range of demographic manipulations to determine optimum population management regimes before they are implemented.","Dept Environm Food & Rural Affairs, Cent Sci Lab, York YO41 1LZ, N Yorkshire, England; Overbury, Stratford Upon Avon CV37 0HG, England","Watola, GV (corresponding author), Dept Environm Food & Rural Affairs, Cent Sci Lab, York YO41 1LZ, N Yorkshire, England.",,"Smith, Graham C/J-2593-2013","Smith, Graham C/0000-0002-9897-6794",,,,25,15,17,0,16,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-8901,,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Consequently, populations inhabiting different environments can exhibit divergent phenotypes as a result of either habitat-specific selection or plasticity. Urban habitats in particular represent different challenges for organisms adapted for rural environments, including disparate complements of predators and competitors, resource availability, and habitat complexity. In this paper, I review work aimed at understanding the different selective challenges experienced by rural and urban populations of green anole lizards, primarily those in southeastern Louisiana. I also describe a long-term mark-recapture experiment on an urban population of green anoles in New Orleans, and consider how sex ratios and population density changes over time. Collectively, this work shows that urban and rural populations of green anoles diverge markedly in behavior and morphology driven both by differences in habitat and the presence of competitors in the urban environment; however, it also shows that the effects of urbanization on the ecology and evolution of green anoles are understudied.","[Lailvaux, Simon P.] Univ New Orleans, Dept Biol Sci, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA","Lailvaux, SP (corresponding author), Univ New Orleans, Dept Biol Sci, New Orleans, LA 70148 USA.",slailvaux@gmail.com,,,,,,137,1,1,2,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Observations were made for 72 consecutive hours in each of eight ice-free months and include extensive, relatively nonintrusive field observations of pumpkinseed behavior at night. We tallied numbers of passes above the substrate and numbers of substrate strikes (at substrate or at vegetation). Variation among months accounted for 40-50% of the total variation in rates of daytime passing and substrate striking, which peaked in May and September. Among-day variation in daytime foraging activity within months was high, accounting for 50-57% of the total variance, and the variances we measured can be used to plan replication levels necessary to achieve adequate statistical power in future studies involving measurements of daily ration or comparisons of exploitation rates in different habitats. Simultaneous video monitoring at multiple sites allows one to factor out the day-to-day variance and provides a sensitive way to compare foraging variables in different sites or habitats. Although pumpkinseeds are usually considered diurnal feeders, some foraging occurred at night in each month. The median rate of fish passing at night was about half the median diurnal and crepuscular rates. Rates of substrate striking were much lower at night than during the day, but planktonic feeding at night was higher, so that nocturnal striking rates on plankton plus substrate were more than 75% of the diurnal values.

The study of venoms is of great interest in diverse fields, such as evolutionary ecology and biotechnology. Omics technologies have contributed to understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that molded snake venoms to their present-day structural and functional variability landscape.Areas covered: This review article reflects on two recent implementations in venomics: absolute quantification of intact proteins by elemental mass spectrometry, and top-down molecular mass spectrometry.Expert commentary: Leveraging on a new way of polyatomic interference removal, a triple quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry configuration has proven feasible for the absolute quantification of venom toxins via sulfur detection. A major advantage of this approach over quantitative molecular mass spectrometry techniques is that only a generic S-standard is required to quantify all the chromatographically separated sulfur-containing fractions. Top-down venomics is in its infancy but, due to recent hardware and software developments, is gaining momentum. Proteoform-resolved venom proteomes are needed to understand the spatio-temporal variability landscape underlying the adaptations that drive intraspecific venom evolution. Integrating top-down venomics and absolute proteoform quantification into a novel elemental and molecular mass spectrometry configuration will represent a quantitative leap in the study of individual venoms.","[Calvete, Juan J.] CSIC, Evolutionary & Translat Venom Lab, Jaime Roig 11, E-46010 Valencia, Spain","Calvete, JJ (corresponding author), CSIC, Evolutionary & Translat Venom Lab, Jaime Roig 11, E-46010 Valencia, Spain.",jcalvete@ibv.csic.es,"Calvete, Juan J/K-9619-2014; Calvete, Juan/P-2555-2019","Calvete, Juan J/0000-0001-5026-3122; Calvete, Juan/0000-0001-5026-3122","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Madrid, Spain [BFU2013-42833-P]","This paper was supported by grant BFU2013-42833-P, from the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Madrid, Spain.",,119,15,15,0,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1478-9450,1744-8387,,EXPERT REV PROTEOMIC,Expert Rev.

When available, Daphnia spp. are often preferred by age-0 yellow perch and bluegill sunfish because of energetic profitability. We hypothesised that predation by age-0 yellow perch could lead to a midsummer decline (MSD) of Daphnia spp. and that priority effects may favour yellow perch because they hatch before bluegill, allowing them to capitalise on Daphnia spp. prior to bluegill emergence. 2. Data were collected from 2004 to 2010 in Pelican Lake, Nebraska, U. S. A. The lake experienced a prolonged MSD in all but 1 year (2005), generally occurring within the first 2 weeks of June except in 2008 and 2010 when it occurred at the end of June. MSD timing is not solely related to seasonal patterns of age-0 yellow perch consumption. Nevertheless, when Daphnia spp. biomass was low during 2004 and 2006-2010 (<4 mg wet weight L-1), predation by age-0 yellow perch seems to have suppressed Daphnia spp. biomass (i.e. <1.0 mg wet weight L-1). The exception was 2005 when age-0 yellow perch were absent. 3. Growth of age-0 bluegill was significantly faster in 2005, when Daphnia spp. were available in greater densities (>4 mg wet weight L-1) compared with the other years (<0.2 mg wet weight L-1). 4. We conclude that age-0 yellow perch are capable of reducing Daphnia biomass prior to the arrival of age-0 bluegill, ultimately slowing bluegill growth. Thus, priority effects favour age-0 yellow perch when competing with age-0 bluegill for Daphnia. However, these effects may be minimised if there is a shorter time between hatching of the two species, higher Daphnia spp. densities or lower age-0 yellow perch densities.","[Kaemingk, Mark A.; Willis, David W.] S Dakota State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Management, Brookings, SD 57007 USA; [Jolley, Jeffrey C.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Columbia River Fisheries Program Off, Vancouver, WA USA; [Chipps, Steven R.] S Dakota State Univ, US Geol Survey, S Dakota Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Brookings, SD 57007 USA","Kaemingk, MA (corresponding author), S Dakota State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Management, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.",mark.kaemingk@sdstate.edu,"Kaemingk, Mark/Q-2191-2019","Kaemingk, Mark/0000-0001-9588-4563",Nebraska Game and Parks Commission through the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration [F-118-R],"We are grateful to all the technicians who assisted in the field and laboratory.

Under such conditions, trophic cascades are predicted to occur when predator populations are reduced or removed. Studies on how predator removal indirectly affects herbivory rates in agricultural systems are lacking. Through a bird-exclosure experiment, I test the hypothesis that insectivorous birds indirectly defend oil palms (Elaeis guineensis) from herbivorous insects. Results show that bird exclusion significantly increased herbivory damage to oil palms, and that the size of this exclusion effect increased with bird density, although the latter result was not statistically significant. These findings suggest that insectivorous birds deliver a natural pest control service for oil palm agriculture, which is important not only for the direct benefits it delivers for human welfare, but also in strengthening the economic justifications for conserving the remaining natural habitats and biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.","Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Koh, LP (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 106A Guyot Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",lkoh@princeton.edu,"Koh, Lian Pin/A-5794-2010","Koh, Lian Pin/0000-0001-8152-3871",,,,33,82,84,1,86,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",1051-0761,,,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

The efficiency of obtaining prey or host items is reduced by intraspecific competition. As the optimal search behavior depends on the intensity of competition, it is important for the parasitoid or predator to obtain information on this intensity. Previous studies have shown that parasitoids can obtain information regarding competition from encounters with already parasitized hosts. They then change their host searching behavior accordingly. However, whether parasitoids obtain the information directly from observing the presence of conspecifics remains unclear. We used Tiphodytes gerriphagus (Marchal) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae), the solitary egg parasitoid of water striders, for testing the effect of density of conspecifics on host searching behavior. Females of T.gerriphagus dive into the water to search for hosts and sometimes they dive without hosts present. Thus, we investigated whether T.gerriphagus changed underwater activities in response to the density of conspecifics in the absence of hosts. Four densities (1, 2, 4, and 8 female T.gerriphagus) were investigated. Females in competitive situations (groups of 2, 4, and 8 females) displayed host searching behavior, but the solitary females did not. This indicates that the presence of conspecifics triggers host searching behavior and that T.gerriphagus femalesobtain information on competition directly from conspecifics and use it for modifying their behavior.","[Hirayama, Hiroyuki; So, Takayuki; Kasuya, Eiiti] Kyushu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Lab Ecol Sci,Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan","Hirayama, H (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Lab Ecol Sci,Higashi Ku, Hakozaki 6-1-10, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",hirohirayama@kyudai.jp,"Kasuya, Eiiti/B-6447-2013",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [22370010]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, JapanMinistry of the Environment, Japan [S9];  [25650149]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [25650149] Funding Source: KAKEN","We express our gratitude to all our colleagues at the Laboratory of Ecology, Kyushu University, for their help and encouragement.

Newly hatched postlarvae (stage IV) were divided into two treatments. Naive postlarvae were raised in single compartments, while trained postlarvae were released communally into tanks with substrate and shelter, allowing for developing burrowing and shelter-seeking behaviour and interactions with conspecifics. The duration of the treatment lasted 181 days in 2007/2008 and 226 days in 2008/2009. In the second experiment, 4-mo old juveniles were purchased from a commercial hatchery and divided into the same two treatment groups. The treatments were considerably shorter, lasting 47 days. At the end of the treatment period an equal number of juveniles from each treatment was released into experimental units with substrate and shelter i.e. semi-natural system for a period of 91-145 days. Number of shelters was half the total number of juveniles to induce competition for shelters. In both experiments, trained juveniles occupied more shelters and had higher survival than naive juveniles. Combining all experiments, average survival was 53% in trained lobsters compared with 18% in the naive lobsters. These results are the first to demonstrate that enriching the hatchery environment for a period of time (a minimum of 47 days here) while rearing European lobster juveniles increased their shelter occupancy and their survival compared to naive juveniles the same size and age. Survival rates were 3-4 times higher in trained compared to naive lobsters after 145 days. (C) 2016 The Authors.

We used an individual-level approach to describe the foraging behavior of an abundant, generalist predator that inhabits a dynamic marine ecosystem, focusing specifically on the different foraging strategies used by individuals in the same demographic group. We collected data on movements and diving behavior of adult female California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) across multiple foraging trips to sea. Sea lions (n = 35) used one of three foraging strategies that primarily differed in their oceanic zone and dive depth: a shallow, epipelagic strategy, a mixed epipelagic/benthic strategy, and a deep-diving strategy. Individuals varied in their degree of fidelity to a given strategy, with 66 % of sea lions using only one strategy on all or most of their foraging trips across the two-month tracking period. All foraging strategies were present in each of the sampling years, but there were inter-annual differences in the population-level importance of each strategy that may reflect changes in prey availability. Deep-diving sea lions traveled shorter distances and spent a greater proportion of time at the rookery than sea lions using the other two strategies, which may have energetic and reproductive implications. These results highlight the importance of an individual-based approach in describing the foraging behavior of female California sea lions and understanding how they respond to the seasonal and annual changes in prey availability that characterize the California Current System.","[McHuron, E.

Presently, human-induced environmental changes are altering the process of sexual selection by influencing male-male interactions and female mate choice. Here, we show that increased density of filamentous algae due to eutrophication reverses parasite-mediated selection during reproduction in threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). When we manipulated the density of artificial algae in a breeding area in the Baltic Sea, more males nested in dense than in sparse vegetation, but the males in dense vegetation were more parasitized. Interestingly, heavily parasitized males acquired more eggs than less parasitized males in dense vegetation but not in sparse vegetation. The higher probability of reproduction for parasitized males in dense algae growth could be due to impaired visibility relaxing male-male competition or reducing female choosiness. This could favour males in poor condition that often invest more in attracting females than males in good condition. In sparse vegetation, parasitized males may have a lower reproductive success due to intense male-male competition, careful female choice and high predation rate selecting against parasitized males. The results suggest that eutrophication could alter the fraction of the population that reproduces, which could have long-term evolutionary consequences.","[Heuschele, Jan; Candolin, Ulrika] Univ Helsinki, Dept Biosci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Heuschele, J (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, HiB, Dept Biol, POB 7803, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",janheuschele@web.de,"Heuschele, Jan/A-8794-2013","Heuschele, Jan/0000-0001-8203-0542; Candolin, Ulrika/0000-0001-8736-7793",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission,"We thank U.

Comparing populations in different ecological contexts is one potential approach to elucidating the most critical of such factors. In the current study, we found that the body size of the land hermit crab Coenobita rugosus was significantly larger on Dongsha Island in the South China Sea than on other eco-islands around Southern Taiwan. We hypothesized that this could be due to differences in (1) shell resources, (2) parasite impact, (3) competition, (4) predation, and (5) food. We found no supporting evidence for the first three hypotheses; the shells used by the hermit crabs on Dongsha were in poorer condition than were those used elsewhere, extremely few individuals in the region had ectoparasites, and the density of hermit crabs varied considerably among localities within each island. However, significantly higher percentages of C. rugosus reached age 3 years on Dongsha than at Siziwan bay in Taiwan. Two growth rate indices inferred from size structures suggested faster growth on Dongsha than at Siziwan. The condition index (i. e., the body mass/shield length ratio of C. rugosus) was also greater on Dongsha than at Siziwan. Therefore, Dongsha hermit crabs seem to have superior diet and growth performance. Seagrass debris accumulation at the shore of Dongsha was considerable, whereas none was observed at Siziwan or on the other islands, where dicot leaves were the dominant food item for the vegetarian hermit crabs. We then experimentally evaluated the possible role of seagrass as food for C. rugosus. The crabs on Dongsha preferred seagrass to dicot leaves, and their growth increment was faster when they fed on seagrass than when they fed on dicot leaves; no such differences were found in the Siziwan hermit crabs. The aforementioned results are compatible with the food hypothesis explaining the size differences among the islands. The predator hypothesis could explain the greater life span but not the other findings. Populations of C. rugosus on islands with seagrass debris piles probably contribute more to the gene pool of the species because higher proportions of these populations could achieve high fecundity. The fate of these terrestrial hermit crabs may rely on the health of underwater seagrass ecosystems that are under threat from global change.","[Hsu, Chia-Hsuan; Soong, Keryea] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Oceanog, Kaohsiung, Taiwan","Soong, K (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Oceanog, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",keryea@gmail.com,,"Hsu, Chia-Hsuan/0000-0002-5128-5902; Soong, Keryea/0000-0002-4371-7103","Marine National Park for a graduate-student fellowship; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, through Asian-Pacific Ocean Research Center of National SunYat-sen University [105-2811-M-110-001]; Asian Pacific Ocean Research Center; National Sun Yat-senUniversity, Taiwan","The authors would like to thank Marine National Park for a graduate-student fellowship to CH.

Males of the threadtail damselfly Protoneura amatoria reversibly use two alternative mating tactics (perching vs. hovering) and have previously been found to modulate their use of these tactics in response to variation in both light conditions and the density of ovipositing females. Here, I show that mating success payoffs of the two tactics are differentially influenced by these factors. The payoff of the perching tactic was greater than that of the hovering tactic under low light conditions and at low densities of ovipositing females. The payoff of the hovering tactic was greater under high light conditions and higher densities of ovipositing females. The differential success of the two mating tactics in response to light conditions is discussed in light of flight dynamics, vision, and predation.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Larison, B (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr So, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",blarison@ucla.edu,,"Larison, Brenda/0000-0002-0264-7276",The Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute; University of CaliforniaUniversity of California System; The National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DDIG 0309426],"This work was funded by The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, the University of California, and The National Science Foundation (NSF-DDIG 0309426).

Contest behaviour varies based on factors such as the value of the contested resources and the agonistic ability of rivals. Much work on animal contests has examined aggression, but vigilance, or a state of heightened alertness directed towards specific stimuli, may also be an important component of competition in many species. In this study, we measure the relationships among social vigilance, aggression, agonistic ability and resource value during staged contests over nest ownership in Polistes dominula nest-founding wasps. Our results show that both social vigilance and aggression are involved in mediating social risk during contests. Nest owner vigilance towards a rival increased with the time of season, a measure of nest value. Owner vigilance was also positively associated with aggression such that more aggressive owners were more vigilant. During contests, aggression of owners and rivals was influenced by different factors. Owner aggression was positively associated with nest size, another measure of nest value, while rival aggression was unrelated to nest size. Instead, rival aggression was associated with facial patterns that function as signals of agonistic ability; rivals were less aggressive to owners that signalled high agonistic ability than they were to owners that signalled low agonistic ability. The distinct predictors of contest behaviour between owners and rivals indicate that competitive role has a surprisingly strong influence on cues used to inform contest behaviour. Differences may occur because owners and rivals have different information and/or motivation. These results also suggest that social vigilance and aggression may be complementary behaviours that animals use to mitigate social threat. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

However, little is known of their habitat use in landscapes fragmented by agriculture, despite the fact that long-tailed weasel populations may be declining in these landscapes. During late winter-spring and late summer-autumn 1998-2000, we monitored 11 long-tailed weasels (seven males, four females) via radio telemetry to examine patterns of habitat use in an Indiana landscape fragmented by agriculture. Long-tailed weasels exhibited scale-dependent patterns of habitat selection (i.e., habitat selection within a landscape and selection of habitats within home ranges). Weasels selected forest patches, fencerows, and drainage ditches, whereas agricultural fields were avoided. Forest patches and fencerows provided suitable den sites and refuge cover from other predators and exhibited an abundant and diverse prey community. Drainage ditches provided movement corridors and access to free-standing, drinking water. The resource selection patterns and limited dispersal ability of long-tailed weasels compared to other carnivores are consistent with the notion that long-tailed weasels appear sensitive to agriculturally induced fragmentation of habitat.","[Gehring, Thomas M.; Cline, Ellisif E.] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Biol, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA; [Swihart, Robert K.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, PA 17907 USA","Gehring, TM (corresponding author), Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Biol, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA.",gehri1tm@cmich.edu,,,American Museum of Natural History; American Society of Mammalogists; Furbearers Unlimited; Purdue University,"We thank O.

As in other devices the temporal dynamics of the interaction displays limit cycle oscillations (LCO) with a characteristic predator-prey relationship between flows and turbulence. At TJ-II, the turbulence-flow front is found to propagate radially outwards at the onset of the LCO and in some particular cases, after a short time interval without oscillations, a reversal in the front propagation velocity is observed. Associated to this velocity reversal, a change in the temporal ordering of the LCO is measured. However, the change in the temporal ordering is not related to an intrinsic change in the nature of the LCO. In all cases the turbulence increase leads the process and produces an increase in the E x B flow shear. Dedicated experiments have been carried out to investigate the physical mechanisms triggering the onset of the LCO. At TJ-II the LCO are preferentially observed close to the transition threshold conditions at specific magnetic configurations having a low order rational surface located at the inner side of the E x B flow shear location. The behaviour of different frequency modes has been analysed and interpreted in terms of a geodesic acoustic mode generated by the non-linear mode coupling of Alfven eigenmodes that evolves towards a low frequency flow, plus a MHD mode linked to the low order rational surface, as precursors of the LCO.","[Estrada, T.; Ascasibar, E.; Blanco, E.; Cappa, A.; Castejon, F.; Hidalgo, C.; van Milligen, B.

We documented daily waterhole visitation patterns of mammals during the wet and dry seasons using camera-traps. We recorded 26 mammal species at the waterholes, with African elephants (Loxodonta africana) and impalas (Aepyceros melampus) being the most abundant. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to determine which variables (season, time of day, water quality, and the presence of carnivores or elephants) would affect animal visitation. Waterhole visitation patterns differed according to time of day, but this effect remained relatively constant between seasons. More animals visited waterholes in the dry season compared to the wet season. Carnivore presence negatively affected impala abundance. Elephant presence did not affect impala and white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) visits to waterholes. Water quality also appeared to play a role in determining animal abundance.

The cost of finding females may be imposed through natural factors extrinsic to males, such as female spatial distribution and predation pressure, which can be challenging to simulate in laboratory conditions. Therefore, studies under natural conditions may be suitable for understanding how the costs of finding mating partners affect male investment in fights. We used the spider Trichonephila clavipes to evaluate the hypotheses that males in field conditions invest more in contests for access to 1) unmated and 2) more fecund females and 3) when access to females is harder. To test these hypotheses, we recorded the occurrence, duration, and escalation of induced contests between males located in webs of females that differed in reproductive status (estimated by female life stage), fecundity (estimated by female abdominal area), and spatial distribution (i.e., isolated or aggregated with webs of other females). The occurrence and duration of contests were unrelated to female value or search costs. However, the probability for escalation was higher when males were fighting for adult (and probably mated) females. We also found that males tended to start a contest more often in aggregated webs. These results indicate that males of T. clavipes adjust investment in contests but contrarily to what we expected. We suggest that males invest more in contests for adult females because they are defending females that they previously fertilized to avoid sperm competition.","[da Silva, Amanda Vieira; Oliveira, Reisla; Cardoso Peixoto, Paulo Enrique] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Genet Ecol & Evolut, Lab Sexual Select & Agonist Interact LASEXIA, Av Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil","Peixoto, PEC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Genet Ecol & Evolut, Lab Sexual Select & Agonist Interact LASEXIA, Av Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",pauloenrique@gmail.com,"Cardoso Peixoto, Paulo Enrique/F-6860-2011","Cardoso Peixoto, Paulo Enrique/0000-0003-4127-625X","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico do Brasil [130948/2018-7, 311212/2018-2]; Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento de Agencia Nacional de Energia Eletrica and Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais (PROECOS project) [GT599]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel SuperiorCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [88882.316026/2019-0]",A.V.S. thanks Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico do Brasil for support (process no 130948/2018-7).

However, efficient means of mitigating such influence on salmonid populations have not been developed, at least not in a practical manner throughout the world. In this study, we investigated effects of declining water levels and structural complexity on populations of age-0 white-spotted charr (Salvelinus leucomaenis) in tank and pond experiments. Survival of the charr was lower in the shallow tanks (15 cm water depth) than in the deeper ones. Similarly, more fish survived in the tanks with artificial structures (cobbles with Ringlong tape) compared to those without them. The grey heron (Ardea cinerea) was the most frequently observed predator during the tank experiment, and settlement of fish in the shallow ponds increased when artificial structures were provided. These results suggest that declining water levels and the loss of structural complexity may lead to a decrease in populations of white-spotted charr by increasing predation risk and interference competition.","[Miyamoto, Kouta] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Res Ctr Freshwater Fisheries, Nikko, Tochigi 3211661, Japan; [Miyamoto, Kouta] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, N9W9 Kita, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan; [Araki, Hitoshi] Hokkaido Univ, Res Fac Agr, N9W9 Kita, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan","Miyamoto, K (corresponding author), Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Res Ctr Freshwater Fisheries, Nikko, Tochigi 3211661, Japan.",mkouta@fra.affrc.go.jp,,,"Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, JapanMinistry of Agriculture Forestry & Fisheries - Japan; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP26292102, 17H03623]","The authors would like to thank Kouji Mutou, Hidefumi Nakamura and Masaharu Murakami of the National Research Institute of Fisheries Science (NRIFS) for their help with taking care of the fish.

In the first two experiments, larvae that were either similar or different in size were paired to examine the potential for intra- and intercohort cannibalism. In the third experiment, size structure of an assemblage of larvae and water temperature were manipulated to explore the seasonal dynamics of cannibalism. Cannibalism was common between individuals that differed in body size by one or more instars. Cannibalism also occurred between individuals similar in size but the rate varied across developmental stages. Results suggest that cannibalism may be most common when water temperatures are warm and late-instar larvae are present at high densities. These results highlight the importance of intra- and intercohort cannibalism as factors that can influence the population dynamics of generalist predators.","[Crumrine, Patrick W.] Rowan Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Glassboro, NJ 08028 USA; [Crumrine, Patrick W.] Rowan Univ, Environm Studies Program, Glassboro, NJ 08028 USA; [Crumrine, Patrick W.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Crumrine, PW (corresponding author), Rowan Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Glassboro, NJ 08028 USA.",crumrine@rowan.edu,"Crumrine, Patrick W/I-7975-2016","Crumrine, Patrick W/0000-0002-5752-8231",University of Kentucky; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0206549],I would like to thank Philip Crowley and Andrew Sih for their valuable feedback on earlier versions of this manuscript and for their assistance in designing the experiments; three anonymous reviewers for critical reading of the manuscript; and Melissa Zwick for logistical support.

This is not uncommon in family groups of diverse taxa, where the dependent offspring compete for the limited resources provided by their parents. Killing a nest mate can relax the level of competition, and cannibalism provides a direct nutritional benefit. However, nest-mate killing bears the risk of reducing indirect fitness if the victim is related (i.e., siblicide), imposing selection on kin-recognition abilities. Based on this hypothesis, we predicted that first instar juveniles (nymphs) of the European earwig (Forficula auricularia) kill and cannibalize unrelated nest mates earlier and more often than related nest mates and that cannibalism has a direct nutritional benefit in terms of survival. We tested these predictions experimentally by establishing related and unrelated pairs of nymphs and recorded survival, aggregation behavior, and cannibalistic outcomes in the absence of alternative food sources. In order to obtain expected survival probabilities of victims and survivors in the absence of any interaction, we simulated virtual nymph pairs based on survival data of singly held control individuals. As predicted, victims lived for less time and survivor for longer than expected from the simulated survival distributions, demonstrating nest-mate killing and cannibalism. Furthermore, unrelated individuals were killed significantly earlier and were more often cannibalized than related individuals. The survival patterns of victims and survivors were quantitatively consistent with the expectations of Hamilton's rule. Our study shows that earwig nymphs recognize kin and adjust their nest-mate killing and cannibalistic behavior as predicted under the hypothesis of kin-selected siblicide and cannibalism.","[Dobler, Ralph; Koelliker, Mathias] Univ Basel, Inst Zool, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland","Dobler, R (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Inst Zool, Vesalgasse 1, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland.",ralph.dobler@stud.unibas.ch,"Dobler, Ralph/A-5341-2009",,Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [3100A0-111969],Swiss National Science Foundation (Grant No. 3100A0-111969 to M.

To shed further tight on the topic, the present work investigated the capacity of soil. microarthropods to colonise defaunated soil in the presence and absence of earthworms. Microcosms composed of plastic boxes were prepared with a central cage containing two endogeic earthworms (Hormogaster elisae). In one experiment, the cage contained defaunated natural, soil white that outside was non-defaunated. In a second experiment, the soil outside the cage was defaunated white that inside the cage was non-defaunated. All microcosms were kept at 13 degrees C with 20% soil-water content for 21 days before extracting microarthropods for enumeration by standard methods. In the first experiment, the majority of microarthropod groups were not able to colonise the defaunated soil containing earthworms, but did colonise it when earthworms were absent. In the second experiment, nearly all the microarthropod groups left the central cages containing earthworms, white in the controls without earthworms the majority stayed inside. The results indicate that different microarthropod taxa are affected unequally by the presence of the earthworms. Due to their greater mobility Tarsonemidae and sometimes Gamasida were able to colonise the defaunated soil even when earthworms were present. In contrast, Oribatida, members of which disperse slowly and are very sensitive to soil perturbations, were generally unable to colonise the soil whether earthworms were present or not. However, the presence of H. elisae had a negative effect on the numbers of most groups of microarthropods and on their ability to colonise new environments. Physico-chemical perturbations produced by endogeic earthworms acting as ecosystem engineers, competition for organic matter and passive predation are discussed as possible causes of this negative effect.

We detected a significant interaction between seed addition and surface soil disturbance on seedling recruitment over 2 years of establishment. Plots that received both supplemental seed addition and disturbance established 10.5 times as many rosettes as control plots. We did not detect main or interactive effects of caging on seedling establishment. We explored the importance of density-dependent recruitment by investigating the number of rosettes per experimental plot through time. In addition, we used planned contrasts to compare the absolute and percent changes in control and treatment plot rosette densities between the study years. We found significant downward concave curvature to the seedling recruitment curve, suggesting negative density-dependent recruitment across the experimental range of rosette densities. We found a significant difference between the control plots and the seed addition-disturbance plots in terms of absolute changes in plot density from 1997 to 1998. Greater net mortality occurred in plots that received both seed addition and disturbance. However, we found no differences among treatments in the percent change in rosette density across the study years. Our study demonstrates that seedling recruitment in natural plant populations may be limited by the interaction of seed and microsite availability, and that seedling recruitment in scarlet gilia may be negatively density dependent. Our results suggest that the fecundity effects of particular plant-animal interactions (e.g., pollination, herbivory) may affect scarlet gilia population dynamics, particularly under conditions of high soil disturbance.","Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Juenger, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, 3060 Valley Life Sci Bldg 3140, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",tj@socrates.berkeley.edu,,"Bergelson, Joy/0000-0001-7893-7387",,,,39,29,30,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAY,2000,123,3,,,,,358,363,,10.1007/s004420051022,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,328ZX,WOS:000087882600007,28308590,,,,2021-09-27,

Here, we separate effects of natural densities of diurnal fishes and nocturnal shrimps in structuring the benthic community of a stream draining Costa Pica's Atlantic slope. We experimentally manipulated the spatial and temporal access of fishes and shrimps to benthic resources, in situ, using electric fences powered by solar-powered fence chargers. Both fishes and shrimps significantly reduced inorganic sediment mass, organic ash-free dry mass (AFDM), densities of larval Chironomidae, and total insects: their combined effects were greater than effects of either group alone, and there was no significant interaction. Fishes shifted algal community composition from diatoms to green and blue-green algae and benthic insect communities towards chironomids, while shrimps had no significant effect on community composition. Effects of fishes were generally greater than those of shrimps, and this is due, in part, to higher natural densities and foraging pressures of fishes. Furthermore, shrimps foraged for significantly longer periods of time in the treatment where fishes were excluded than in the combined fish and shrimp access treatment, suggesting that diurnally feeding fishes are strong interactors, mediating resource availability to nocturnally feeding shrimps. Natural erosion and sediment-mediated effects of macroconsumers (both direct and indirect) also affected algal communities: a manual sediment removal experiment resulted in significant reductions of diatom biovolume and increases in the filament length of green and blue-green algae. Our results show the importance of: (1) assessing macroconsumer effects in a relatively natural depositional environment subject to background erosion and sloughing (i.e., in this case by using electric exclosures); (2) evaluating effects of natural densities of both diurnal and nocturnal macroconsumers through time in the context of these abiotic effects; and (3) distinguishing between the response of different types of algal resources (e.g., diatoms vs. green and blue-green algae), which are differentially affected by sedimentation and erosion. Cage experiments, short-term observations, or one-time sampling of undifferentiated algae may artificially overestimate trophic effects and underestimate abiotic effects. We found no evidence of a trophic cascade. Our findings are in agreement with the theoretical prediction that large-sized omnivores have strong direct trophic (feeding) effects, both on smaller primary consumers (insects) and basal resources (algae).","Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Pringle, CM (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",,"Pringle, Catherine M/I-1841-2012",,,,,51,131,135,1,20,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,1998,79,1,,,,,269,280,,10.2307/176881,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,YR740,WOS:000071525500024,,,,,2021-09-27,

In Photinus fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae), courtship is based on bioluminescent flash signals produced by both sexes. We conducted field observations of Photinus greeni fireflies engaged in competitive courtships, in which females are able to simultaneously assess several males, to identify male morphological traits and courtship behaviors that might predict male mating success. Male morphological traits did not differ between males that successfully mated compared with unsuccessful males (dialoging males that did not mate). However, courtship behavioral interactions differed: successful males tended to have higher flash pattern rates (number of flash patterns per minute), and their courtship flashes were more likely to be answered by females. We also examined how the risk of predation by Photuris fireflies altered courtship behavior of their Photinus prey. When predatory Photuris fireflies were present, P. greeni females were less likely to mate, and showed decreased flash responses to most males. However, P. greeni males that did successfully mate in spite of Photuris presence were males that maintained high flash pattern rates that elicited female responses. These results suggest that both female mate choice and Photuris predation exert strong selective pressures on the evolution of courtship signals in Photinus fireflies.","Tufts Univ, Dept Biol, Medford, MA 02155 USA; Swarthmore Coll, Dept Biol, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA","Lewis, SM (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Dept Biol, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",sara.lewis@tufts.edu,"Demary, Kristian/AAB-9989-2019",,,,,30,31,31,2,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,MAY,2006,112,5,,,,,485,492,,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2005.01176.x,,,8,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,032TX,WOS:000236799000008,,,,,2021-09-27,

Sculpins, Cottus spp., are an important food-web link between macroinvertebrates and larger stream fishes and are greatly affected by culverts. Results from a previous study indicate a substantial increase in the relative abundance of mottled sculpin, Cottus bairdii, was observed upstream of a renovated road-stream crossing during the first season after construction. Redistribution of this nature from a putatively sedentary species would have required substantial movement. Our objectives were to quantify post-restoration mottled sculpin movement and habitat use in a restored stream reach. The extent of post-restoration mottled sculpin movement and habitat use were directly measured using telemetry of Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag-marked fish. The maximum linear distance moved by a marked mottled sculpin was 839 m; 23% of marked mottled sculpin moved >100 m. The number of detections of marked mottled sculpin in each segment was significantly correlated with the amount of small wood (5-10 cm diameter). Increased distribution of mottled sculpin in previously unavailable upstream habitats coupled with substantial post-restoration movement distances provides new insight on their potential for redistribution following habitat reconnection, which is an important consideration for stream restoration projects.","[Deboer, Jason A.; Snyder, Eric B.] Grand Valley State Univ, Dept Biol, Allendale, MI 49401 USA; [Holtgren, J.

It has long been regarded as a resilient system, oscillating through periods of hypersalinity and freshwater conditions, depending on the prevailing climate. The alteration of the system's catchment involving the diversion of the Mfolozi River away from Lake St Lucia, however, challenged the resilience of the system, particularly during the most recent drought (2002-2011), sacrificing much of its biodiversity. This study reports on the transition of the St Lucia zooplankton community from a dry hypersaline state to a new wet phase. Sampling was undertaken during routine quarterly surveys at five representative stations along the lake system from February 2011 to November 2013. A total of 54 taxa were recorded during the study period. The zooplankton community was numerically dominated by the calanoid copepods Acartiella natalensis and Pseudodiaptomus stuhlmanni and the cyclopoid copepod Oithona brevicornis. While the mysid Mesopodopsis africana was still present in the system during the wet phase, it was not found in the swarming densities that were recorded during the previous dry phase, possibly due to increased predation pressure, competition with other taxa and or the reconnection with the Mfolozi River via a beach spillway. The increase in zooplankton species richness recorded during the present study shows that the system has undergone a transition to wet state, with the zooplankton community structure reflecting that recorded during the past. It is likely, though, that only a full restoration of natural mouth functioning will result in further diversity increases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Biodiversity is expected to decline following habitat loss and isolation, potentially impeding ecosystem function. But because greater isolation usually accompanies habitat loss, the effects of habitat amount and isolation can be confounded. Moreover, the type or quality of the intervening matrix habitat can mediate amount and isolation effects on biodiversity. We used a landscape microcosm of oak leaf litter patches to examine the responses of bacterial communities and the ecosystem function of oak leaf decomposition to patch size, degree of isolation, and matrix habitat type (pine litter or bare ground). We found that oak patch size had no significant effect on bacterial communities or decomposition rates. However, bacterial richness increased with greater patch isolation and when oak litter patches were surrounded by a matrix of pine litter, rather than bare ground. The benefit of patch isolation for biodiversity runs counter to that expected by island biogeography theory, suggesting that spatially dependent interspecific interactions, such as predation or competition, may override direct dispersal effects. Higher bacterial richness in oak litter patches surrounded by a pine litter matrix indicated that spillover from neighboring matrix habitat can increase local richness. Instead of greater bacterial richness enhancing ecosystem functioning, leaf litter decomposition was negatively correlated with bacterial richness: Decomposition was slower in isolated oak litter patches and patches surrounded by a pine litter matrix. This negative relationship may be a result of spatial dynamics that can promote the persistence of bacteria from pine litter habitats that are not well suited to oak litter decomposition. Overall, our experiment indicates that effects of habitat loss, isolation, and matrix quality on richness and composition may depend on spatially constrained interspecific interactions, which can determine the functional ability of communities.","[Spiesman, Brian J.; Inouye, Brian D.] Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Stapper, Andres P.] Stanford Univ, Dept Otolaryngol, Stanford, CA 94304 USA; [Spiesman, Brian J.] Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Spiesman, BJ (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, B-157, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.; Spiesman, BJ (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",brianspiesman@gmail.com,,,NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1110738],"Tania Kim aided with the setup of the study and, along with Nora Underwood and Tom Miller, provided feedback on an earlier draft of the manuscript.

While formerly abundant, agricultural practices, predation, angling pressure, barriers to mobility, and competition from other species appear to be the causes of decreased presence of artic grayling in the Northwest (Skaar 1989). The purpose of this study was to augment the information base of the swimming ability of arctic grayling and to examine the effect of repeated trials using the same fish. Forty hatchery-raised grayling were separated into two cohorts and reared in an artificial stream. The mean fork length of all fish was 290 mm (SD +/- 16). Cohort 1 was tested in a swim chamber experiment once per week for three consecutive weeks. Cohort 2 was tested only once in the swim chamber sixteen weeks later. Each fish was tested by placing it in the chamber initially operating at a low water velocity (30.5 cm s(-1)) and then regularly increasing the velocity until the fish rested on the screen at the downstream end of the chamber. The maximum water velocity against which each fish held its position was observed, and is reported as the sprint speed (Usprint). Overall the mean Usprint observed was 5.64 BL (body length) s(-1) (SD +/- 0.78) equal to an absolute velocity of 1.66 m s(-1) (SD +/- 0.19). Cohort 1 had a mean Usprint of 5.40 BL s(-1) (1.62 m s(-1)) and Cohort 2 had a mean Usprint of 6.33 BL s(-1) (1.77 m s(-1)). There were significant differences, and a generally increasing trend, in Usprint between the successive trials using Cohort 1.","[Cahoon, Joel; Jones, Audrey; Plymesser, Kathryn; Blank, Matt] Montana State Univ, Civil Engn Dept, 205 Cobleigh Hall, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Kappenman, Kevin; Ryan, Erin] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Bozeman Fish Technol Ctr, 4050 Bridger Canyon Rd, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA","Cahoon, J (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Civil Engn Dept, 205 Cobleigh Hall, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",joelc@montana.edu,,,,,,23,0,0,0,8,NORTHWEST SCIENTIFIC ASSOC,SEATTLE,"JEFFREY DUDA, USGS, WESTERN FISHERIES RES CTR, 6505 NE 65 ST, SEATTLE, WA 98115 USA",0029-344X,2161-9859,,NORTHWEST SCI,Northwest Sci.,AUG,2018,92,3,,,,,234,239,,10.3955/046.092.0309,,,6,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GY6HI,WOS:000448687600006,,,,,2021-09-27,

Using hundreds of surveys in the JZB and the adjacent Yellow Sea (YS), we examined the population fluctuations over the recent 20 years, possible links between abundance and environmental factors, and the reproductive strategies. In the JZB, P. globosa mainly appeared from August to December each year, reaching the maximum abundance of 170 ind. m(-3) in August 2008. A general warming trend continues in the JZB during the recent two decades, with the alternating of warm and cool periods. Temperature is recognized as a primary driver of abundance variations, with significantly higher abundance levels in warmer years than in cooler years. The population uses either larval reproduction or adult reproduction almost exclusively in the JZB, with unknown mechanisms. High abundance can result from both reproductive strategies. Larval reproduction distinguishes itself from adult reproduction by significantly smaller parent size, egg size and clutch size, explaining the short-size dominated population in several surveys. Clutch size is positively related to body size and temperature. The geographical range of the YS population reached to similar to 39 degrees N in June 2014, indicating a northward expansion since the late 1990s, together with other evidences from the JZB and the Bohai Sea. While the successful establishment could be driven primarily by warming, lack of competitors and predators as well as the particular life history strategies also contributed. Issues of the vectors for introduction, local overwintering population, and regulatory mechanism of reproductive strategy need to be addressed in further studies.","[Wang, Shiwei; Zhang, Guangtao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Jiaozhou Bay Marine Ecosyst Res Stn, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shiwei; Zhang, Guangtao; Sun, Song] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Megasci, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shiwei; Zhang, Guangtao; Sun, Song] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guangtao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Konglin] Minjiang Univ, Inst Oceanog, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China; [Sun, Song] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China","Wang, SW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Jiaozhou Bay Marine Ecosyst Res Stn, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.",wangshiwei@qdio.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41406148]; Aoshan Science and Technology Innovation Project [2016ASKJ02-02]; National Key Research and Development Project [2017YFE0111100],"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Number 41406148), the Aoshan Science and Technology Innovation Project (Grant Number 2016ASKJ02-02) and the National Key Research and Development Project (Grant Number 2017YFE0111100).",,44,1,1,8,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,1879-1697,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Many flowers produce ant-repellent substances that prevent ants from discouraging pollinator visits. When a flower's most effective pollinator is unaffected by predatory ants, however, flowers should benefit from the presence of ants that deter less effective pollinators from consuming resources. 2. Behavioural assays revealed that Melastoma malabathricum flowers, pollinated by large carpenter bees, Xylocopa spp., produce ant attractants that recruit weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina. 3. The presence of ants was associated with an increase in the reproductive success of M. malabathricum flowers. This outcome likely resulted from the filtering effect of ants on the community of flower visitors: ants deter less effective pollinators and attract Xylocopa bees through an indirect effect on resource depletion. 4. Synthesis. Although plant-pollinator interactions are classified as mutualisms, not all flower visitors are effective pollinators, and some can be parasites or conditional parasites. As a result, predators that deter flower visitors can have positive or negative effects on plant fitness, depending on whether they deter all visitors or a subset of them, and on the relative effectiveness of deterred and undeterred visitors.","[Gonzalvez, Francisco G.; Rodriguez-Girones, Miguel A.] CSIC, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain; [Santamaria, Luis] CSIC UIB, Mediterranean Inst Adv Studies, Esporles 07190, Islas Baleares, Spain; [Corlett, Richard T.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117543, Singapore","Gonzalvez, FG (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Ctra Sacramento S-N, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain.",franciscog.gonzalvez@gmail.com,"Rodriguez-Girones, Miguel A/H-1859-2015; Corlett, Richard T./S-2899-2019; Santamaria, Luis/C-1438-2012","Rodriguez-Girones, Miguel A/0000-0002-5619-9819; Corlett, Richard T./0000-0002-2508-9465; Santamaria, Luis/0000-0002-5072-2912","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion/FEDERSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2007-63223/BOS, CGL2010-16795]; CSIC [JAE-Pre_08_01008]",We thank the Singapore National Parks Board for research permits.

In species where males compete for females, this can lead to highly ornamented males competing for mating opportunities with choosy females, and vice versa. However, even where males compete for mating opportunities, females may exhibit conspicuous displays. These female displays are often poorly understood and it may be unclear whether they declare mating intent, signal intrasexual aggression or form a target for male mate preference. We examined the function of the conspicuous dark eyes that female sand gobies temporarily display during courtship by experimentally testing if males preferred to associate with females with artificially darkened eyes and if dark eyes are displayed during female aggression. By observing interactions between a male and two females freely associating in an aquarium we also investigated in which context females naturally displayed dark eyes. We found that dark eyes were more likely to be displayed by more gravid females than less gravid females and possibly ahead of spawning, but that males did not respond behaviorally to dark eyes or prefer dark-eyed females. Females behaving aggressively did not display dark eyes. We suggest that dark eyes are not a signal per se but may be an aspect of female mate choice, possibly related to vision.","[Olsson, Karin H.; Johansson, Sandra; Blom, Eva-Lotta; Svensson, Ola; Kvarnemo, Charlotta] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Lindstrom, Kai] Abo Akad Univ, Environm & Marine Biol, Turku, Finland; [Svensson, Ola; Skold, Helen Nilsson; Kvarnemo, Charlotta] Univ Gothenburg, Ctr Marine Evolutionary Biol, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Skold, Helen Nilsson] Univ Gothenburg, Sven Loven Ctr Marine Infrastruct Kristineberg, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Olsson, Karin H.] Cefas Lab, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England; [Svensson, Ola] Sodertorn Univ, Sch Nat Sci Technol & Environm Studies, Huddinge, Sweden; [Skold, Helen Nilsson] Havets Hus Lysekil, Strandvagen 9, Lysekil, Sweden","Olsson, KH (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden.; Olsson, KH (corresponding author), Cefas Lab, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England.",olsson.karin.h@gmail.com,"Svensson, Ola/F-5232-2013; /B-5479-2008; Lindstrom, Kai/ABG-4353-2020","Svensson, Ola/0000-0003-3752-3131; /0000-0002-8356-5538; Lindstrom, Kai/0000-0002-8356-5538; Olsson, Karin/0000-0002-1695-0989",Graduate School in Marine Environmental Research at the Gothenburg Centre; Helge Ax:son Johnson Foundation; Linnaeus Center for Marine Evolutionary Biology [217-2008-1719]; Swedish Royal Society of Sciences; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [621-2011-4004]; Wahistrom Foundation,"This work was supported by Graduate School in Marine Environmental Research at the Gothenburg Centre for Marine Research (E-LB), http://gmv.gu.se/english/collaborations-and-projects/collaboration-within-education/graduate-schools/graduate-school-in-marine-environmental-research, Grant is not numbered; Helge Ax:son Johnson Foundation (E-LB), http:http://haxsonj.se/www/, Grant is not numbered; Linnaeus Center for Marine Evolutionary Biology (OS, CK), http://cemeb.science.gu.se, Grant number: 217-2008-1719; Swedish Royal Society of Sciences (KL, KHO), http://www.kva.se/en/, Grant is not numbered; Swedish Research Council (CK), http://www.vr.se, Grant number: 621-2011-4004; Wahistrom Foundation (HNS), Wahistroms stiftelse, c/o Bengt Wedel, Spektrumsgatan 108,42163 Vastra Frolunda, Goteborg, Sweden, Email: bengt.wedel@gmail.com, phone: 46-31/28 44 41, No formal grant number, application date #20140922.

The model describes carbon-nitrogen-phosphorus-based interactions within the mixotroph, interlinking autotrophic and phagotrophic nutrition. The model was tuned to experimental data from these species grown under autotrophic conditions and in mixed batch cultures in which nitrogen:phosphorus stoichiometry (input molar N:P of 4, 16, and 32) of both predator and prey varied. A good fit was attained to all experimentally derived carbon biomass data. The potential effects of temperature and nutrient changes on promoting growth of prey and thus K. veneficum bloom formation were explored using this simulation platform. The simulated biomass of K. veneficum was highest when they were functioning as mixotrophs and when they consumed prey under elevated N:P conditions. The scenarios under low N:P responded differently, with simulations showing larger deviation between mixotrophic and autotrophic growth, depending on temperature. When inorganic nutrients were in balanced proportions, lower biomass of the mixotroph was attained at all temperatures in the simulations, suggesting that natural systems might be more resilient against Karlodinium HAB development in warming conditions if nutrients were available in balanced proportions. These simulations underscore the need for models of HAB dynamics to include consideration of prey; modeling HAB as autotrophs is insufficient. The simulations also imply that warmer, wetter springs that may bring more N with lower N:P, such as predicted under climate change scenarios for Chesapeake Bay, may be more conducive to development of these HABs. Prey availability may also increase with temperature due to differential growth temperature responses of K. veneficum and its prey.","[Lin, Chih-Hsien; Glibert, Patricia M.] Univ Maryland, Horn Point Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Cambridge, MD USA; [Flynn, Kevin J.; Mitra, Aditee] Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Wallace Bldg, Swansea, W Glam, Wales","Flynn, KJ (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Wallace Bldg, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.",k.j.flynn@swansea.ac.uk,"Flynn, KJ/AAA-3232-2021; Flynn, Kevin/AAA-3253-2021; glibert, patricia m/G-1026-2013","Flynn, Kevin/0000-0001-6913-5884; glibert, patricia m/0000-0001-5690-1674; Mitra, Aditee/0000-0001-5572-9331",Taiwanese Government; Bay and Rivers Fellowship from the Horn Point Laboratory; Ryan Saba Memorial Fellowship; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science Competitive Research program [NA17NOS4780180],"C-HL was supported by funding from the Taiwanese Government, the Bay and Rivers Fellowship from the Horn Point Laboratory, and travel support from the Ryan Saba Memorial Fellowship.

The tadpole was recovered from an upper Miocene (Turolian, MN13) diatomaceous konservat-lagerstatte deposit near Tresjuncos (Cuenca Province, Spain). The specimen belongs to an unnamed species of Pelobates (Pelobatidae) of the westernmost Palearctic phylogenetic clade. Its gigantic size was due neither to metabolic (hypothyroidism) nor to ecological (overwintering) causes but merely reflects an optimum living environment. Dying at Gosner developmental stage 41, the ossification pattern of the tadpole is slightly discordant with that of extant Pelobates cultripes, a greater degree for the skull and vertebral column in the fossil. The tadpole, seemingly in excellent health, had an intestine containing abundant remains of an epiphytic/epipelic diatom, different from the planktonic species surrounding the fossilized body. Death was probably violent, as revealed by a fossil hollow trace similar to hematomas made by egret beak strikes.

The specific factors considered in the experimental design were: a) water mix conditions to explore predation under two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) prey distributions, b) prey density to investigate the ingestion rate capacity, and c) incubation time to inspect gut saturation. The eggs and jellyfish ephyrae were collected during the 2012 ABFT spawning survey off Ibiza (Balearic Isl., Western Mediterranean). The results showed that the proportion of feeding ephyrae increased with size. The mean clearance rate of feeding ephyrae, 4.14 L h(-1), was the highest ever recorded for ephyrae. Under calm conditions the eggs floated at the surface (2D spatial arrangement) and the clearance rates, at low prey densities, were at least twice those under mixed conditions (3D spatial arrangement). At high prey density, clearance rate did not differ between mix conditions, probably due to the fast gut saturation, which was reached in c.a. 15 min, as revealed by time series observations of gut contents. The fast saturation of ephyrae and their slow digestion time of approximately 18 h suggest the existence of a diel feeding periodicity. We conclude that in the Western Mediterranean, P. noctiluca ephyrae are capable of predating on ABFT eggs, a highly pulsed and spatially restricted resource that potentially switches from a 3D to a 2D configuration in the absence of wind-generated turbulence. The P. noctiluca and Atlantic Bluefin tuna egg system might represent an example of a general mechanism linking pelagic and neustonic food webs.","[Gordoa, Ana; Farres, Roser; Bacher, Kathrin] CSIC, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Blanes, Dept Marine Ecol, Blanes, Gerona, Spain; [Luis Acuna, Jose] Univ Oviedo, Dept Biol Organismos & Sistemas, Oviedo, Asturias, Spain","Gordoa, A (corresponding author), CSIC, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Blanes, Dept Marine Ecol, Blanes, Gerona, Spain.",gordoa@ceab.csic.es,"Gordoa, Ana/A-1470-2013; Fernandez, Jose Luis Acuna/I-7482-2016","Gordoa, Ana/0000-0003-1822-8196; Fernandez, Jose Luis Acuna/0000-0003-3306-7212",Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness,"This study is part of the project Spatio-temporal overlap and trophic interactions between Atlantic Bluefin Tuna spawning and jellyfish in the Balearic spawning grounds funded by the Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness.

Loss of the ability to fly relaxes body mass constraints which can be particularly advantageous in divers, because underwater performance correlates with mass. The Galapagos Cormorant Phalacrocorax harrisi is flightless and the largest of its 27-member genus. Here, the loss of flight, and consequent reduced foraging range, could be compensated by enhanced dive performance. Over three years, 46 Galapagos Cormorants were successfully equipped with time-depth-temperature recorders, and 30 birds with GPS recorders during the breeding season. Birds foraged at a mean of 690 m from the nest and just 230 m from the nearest coast, confirming an extremely limited foraging range during the breeding season and corresponding increased potential for intraspecific competition. Although the maximum recorded dive depth of 73 m tallied with the species body mass, > 90% of dives were conducted in water,15 m deep. The heavier males foraged in different areas and dived longer and deeper than females, which exposed males to colder water. Consideration of how plumage insulation decreases with depth indicates that diving males should lose 30% more heat than females, although this may be partially compensated by their lower surface area : volume ratio. A simple model highlights how energy expenditure from swimming underwater due to buoyancy and energy lost as heat have opposing trends with increasing depth, leading to the prediction of an optimum foraging depth defined by the volume of plumage air and water temperature. This has rami. cations for all diving seabirds. It is proposed that the reduction in wing size, together with energy-expensive flight musculature, allows the Galapagos Cormorant to be more efficient at shallow depths than other seabirds, but only in warm equatorial waters. The high prey density and predictability of benthic prey in defined areas of the Galapagos can be particularly well exploited by this flightless species, with its limited foraging range, but the Galapagos Cormorant is unlikely to be able to accommodate much change in environmental conditions.","[Wilson, Rory P.] Univ Wales Swansea, Sch Environm & Soc, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Vargas, F.

To evaluate the functional recovery of regenerated right foreleg after being damaged, the behaviors of leg-regenerated ladybugs containing predation, attachment, intraspecific competition, prey preference and fecundity were studied in the laboratory. ResultsThe prey consumption and searching rate of leg-regenerated ladybugs decreased, and their handling time extended. A significantly reduced attachment coefficient was detected in leg-regenerated coccinellids. Because of the competitive inferiority, leg-regenerated ladybugs were greatly hampered in competition with normal opponents, and this inferiority led to a switch of prey preference from big-sized adults to small-sized first-second instar nymphs of Paratriozasinica. However, although reduced functional abilities were examined, the leg-regenerated paternity had a higher reproductive output compared to the normal paternity. ConclusionLeg-regenerated ladybugs caused by cannibalism may make an investment tradeoff between egg fecundity and functional recovery. Thus, larval cannibalism potentially improves the offspring production of the biological control agent in complex environments.

However, prolonged glucocorticoid elevation may cause homeostatic overload. Using extensive field investigations of banded mongoose (Mungos mungo) groups in northern Botswana, we assessed the influence of reproduction, predation risk, and food limitation on apparent homeostatic overload (n=13 groups, 1542 samples from 268 animals). We experimentally manipulated reproduction and regulated food supply in captive mongooses, and compared their glucocorticoid responses to those obtained from free-living groups. Results At the population level, variation in glucocorticoid levels in free-living mongooses was explained by food limitation: fecal organic matter, recent rainfall, and access to concentrated anthropogenic food resources. Soil macrofauna density and reproductive events explained less and predation risk very little variation in glucocorticoid levels. Reproduction and its associated challenges alone (under regulated feeding conditions) increased glucocorticoid levels 19-fold in a captive group. Among free-living groups, glucocorticoid elevation was seasonal (occurring in late dry season or early wet season when natural food resources were less available), but the timing of peak glucocorticoid production was moderated by access to anthropogenic resources (groups with fewer anthropogenic food sources had peaks earlier in dry seasons). Peak months represented 12- and 16-fold increases in glucocorticoids relative to nadir months with some animals exhibiting 100-fold increases. Relative to the captive group nadir, some free-living groups exhibited 60-fold increases in peak glucocorticoid levels with some animals exhibiting up to 800-fold increases. Most of these animals exhibited 1- to 10-fold increases relative to the captive animal peak. Conclusions Banded mongooses exhibit seasonal chronic glucocorticoid elevation, associated primarily with food limitation and secondarily with reproduction. Magnitude and duration of this elevation suggests that this may be maladaptive for some animals, with possible fitness consequences. In late dry season, this population may face a convergence of stressors (food limitation, agonistic encounters at concentrated food resources, evictions, estrus, mate competition, parturition, and predation pressure on pups), which may induce homeostatic overload.","[Laver, Pete N.] Biodivers & Dev Inst, 4 Gunners Pk,Grenville Ave,Epping 1, ZA-7460 Cape Town, South Africa; [Ganswindt, Andre; Ganswindt, Stefanie B.] Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Dept Zool & Entomol, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa; [Ganswindt, Andre; Ganswindt, Stefanie B.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Anat & Physiol, Fac Vet Sci, Private Bag X04, ZA-0110 Onderstepoort, South Africa; [Ganswindt, Andre] Univ Pretoria, Ctr Vet Wildlife Studies, Fac Vet Sci, Private Bag X04, ZA-0110 Onderstepoort, South Africa; [Alexander, Kathleen A.] Virginia Tech, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, 100 Cheatham Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Laver, PN (corresponding author), Biodivers & Dev Inst, 4 Gunners Pk,Grenville Ave,Epping 1, ZA-7460 Cape Town, South Africa.",pnlaver@gmail.com,"Ganswindt, Andre/G-9856-2014","Ganswindt, Andre/0000-0002-1474-7602; Laver, Peter/0000-0001-9077-6440",WildiZe Foundation; Virginia Tech; National GeographicNational Geographic Society; CARACAL; University of Pretoria; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1518663],"We thank the WildiZe Foundation, Virginia Tech, National Geographic, and CARACAL for financial support for fieldwork.

Utilizing morphological, genetic, and stable isotope techniques, we found no evidence of discrete trophic morphotypes as previously described, but instead found evidence for an ontogenetic diet shift. Carbon and nitrogen isotope data indicate a 40% decrease in the proportion of benthic feeding and an increase of one trophic position over the size and age ranges of adult kokanee, corresponding to a diet shift from consumption of macroinvertebrates in smaller individuals to piscivory in larger individuals. This novel piscivory in kokanee may result from predatory and competitive freedom resulting from the lack of limnetic predators in Jo-Jo Lake. Piscivorous feeding despite a phenotype-environment mismatch has resulted in large, piscivorous kokanee having up to 70% of their gill rakers damaged. Observed reductions in gill raker number relative to the putative ancestral population are convergent with expectations for piscivorous fishes, despite a presumed lack of standing genetic variation for piscivory in the sockeye salmon - kokanee species complex. Jo-Jo Lake kokanee are a distinctive example of adaptation in salmonids in response to ecological release. This unusual population highlights the importance of phenotypic plasticity in response to competition in shaping the adaptive landscape and altering evolutionary trajectories.","[Shedd, Kyle R.; von Hippel, Frank A.; Willacker, James J.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Biol Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Hamon, Troy R.; Pavey, Scott A.] Natl Pk Serv, Katmai Natl Pk, King Salmon, AK 99613 USA; [Schlei, Ora L.; Wenburg, John K.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Conservat Genet Lab, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA; [Miller, Joe L.] Anchor QEA, Wenatchee, WA 98801 USA; [Pavey, Scott A.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Inst Biol Integrat & Syst, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada","Shedd, KR (corresponding author), Alaska Dept Fish & Game, 333 Raspberry Rd, Anchorage, AK 99518 USA.",kyle.shedd@alaska.gov,"Wenburg, John/Y-4373-2019","Wenburg, John/0000-0001-9831-1672; Willacker, James/0000-0002-6286-5224",Katmai National Park; Alaska INBRE (IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence); US Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service; University of Alaska Anchorage; National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P20GM103395],"B.

Density, size (test diameter), biomass and size-frequencies of both species were assessed in summer 2001 at one location heavily impacted by P. lividus fishery (recreational and commercial), and at three controls. Average sea urchin density (pooling P. lividus and A. lixula), and density of P. lividus did not significantly differ between the impacted location and the controls, while average density of A. lixula was significantly greater at the location where P. lividus was fished. The average size of P lividus was significantly lower at the exploited location than at the controls, whereas that of A. lixula did not differ. Total sea urchin biomass (pooling P. lividus and A. lixula) did not differ between the exploited location and the controls. The average biomasses of P. lividus and of A. lixula, conversely, were lower and greater, respectively, at the fished location than at the control sites. In some cases, distribution patterns of the investigated variables (i.e., density, size and biomass) were affected by fishery at the spatial scale of a few metres (i.e., between replicates). At the controls, P lividus larger than 4 cut (the threshold size for commercialisation) accounted for about one third of the populations surveyed, whereas at the fished location specimens of this size were rare. Size-frequency distributions of A. lixula were fairly similar at the fished and control locations. Although appropriate experimentation would be needed to confirm these patterns, the present study provides suggestive evidence that intense R lividus harvesting may cause reduction in average size and biomass of this echinoid because of the selective harvesting of largest specimens. Densities of P lividus at fished and control areas, instead, did not change, which suggests that P lividus populations subject to fishing could have the potential to recover by appropriate management policies (e.g., catch quotas). Indirect effects of the P lividus harvesting on the co-occurring A. lixula suggest a possible competitive dominance by P. lividus in the absence of selective fishing on this latter species, and a sort of compensation when it is fished. Implications for management of P. lividus exploitation, and for possible ecological consequences of the sea urchin fishery, are also discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Many species face similar dilemmas, yet our understanding of the evolutionary trajectory of CPR social strategies remains unexplored. Here, we provide a first look at the social strategies of our closest living relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), in two novel resource dilemma experiments. Dyads of chimpanzees were presented with renewable resource systems, collapsible at a quantity-dependent threshold. Dyads had to continuously resist overconsumption to maximize collective gains. In study 1, dyads of chimpanzees sustained a renewing juice source. Inequality of juice acquisition between partners predicted sustaining success, indicating that one individual dominated the task while the partner inhibited. Dyads in study 2 fed together on accumulating carrot pieces but could end the accumulation any time by grabbing an immediate selfish source of carrots. Dyads with low tolerance were more successful at collectively sustaining the resource than highly tolerant dyads. Further, the dominant individual was more likely to cause collapse in dyads with low tolerance than dyads with high tolerance. These results indicate that chimpanzees use a dominance-based monopolisation strategy moderated by social tolerance to overcome the tragedy of the commons.","[Koomen, Rebecca; Herrmann, Esther] Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Leipzig, Germany","Koomen, R (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Leipzig, Germany.",becky.koomen@gmail.com,,"Koomen, Rebecca/0000-0002-4198-8874",Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary; Uganda National Council for Science and Technology; Uganda Wildlife Authority,"We are grateful to the management, the animal caregivers, and the trustees of Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary for their enthusiasm, help, and support.

Distinct zonation and geomorphic differences in reservoirs, however, make ecological extrapolations from lakes to reservoirs uncertain. We describe the spatial and temporal distribution of zooplankton, algae, and water clarity across reservoir zones and along a depth gradient in Glen Elder Reservoir, Kansas. Daphnia species were most abundant in the lacustrine zone, with D. pulicaria numerically dominant in early spring and D. mendotae dominant later in 1999 and 2000. Rotifers (Keratella quadrata, Asplanchna spp.) were dominant in the riverine zone in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Algal biomass was not significantly different between zones through most of the sampling periods, except late April in 1999 and mid-April in 2000. Chlorophyll a exceeded 81 mug l(-1) in the lacustrine zone in mid- to late-April in 1999 and 2000, and exceeded 90 mug l(-1) in the riverine zone in mid- April. Water clarity was significantly lower in the riverine zone in 1999 and 2000. Most zooplankton taxa had similar depth distributions at night and day, indicating a lack of diel vertical migration behavior on a large scale. However, in small scale (30 cm vertical enclosures) laboratory experiments, both D. pulicaria and D. mendotae occupied significantly deeper depths (>25 cm) under lighted conditions in the presence of fish chemical cues compared to shallow water (7-17 cm) under dark conditions and in the absence of fish cues. These contrasting results suggest that, as in other studies, Daphnia sense cues from predators and alter their depth in the water column on small scales without natural constraints on movement and choices. However, other factors in the reservoir such as wind-generated water movements and cues from other predators may prevent depth choices similar to those seen under controlled conditions. These results illustrate biotic and abiotic differences between riverine and lacustrine zones in a large reservoir, and contrast with Daphnia depth segregation and migration patterns in natural lakes.","Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Galvin Life Sci Ctr 107, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; Univ Wyoming, US Geol Survey, Biol Bioresources Div, Wyoming Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; Montana State Univ, US Geol Survey, Biol Resources Div, Montana Cooperat Fishery Res Unit,Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA","Bernot, RJ (corresponding author), Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",bernot.1@nd.edu,,"Dodds, Walter/0000-0002-6666-8930",,,,52,23,31,2,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,SEP,2004,525,1-3,,,,,101,112,,10.1023/B:HYDR.0000038857.19342.fd,,,12,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,848RB,WOS:000223483700002,,,,,2021-09-27,

We manipulated size and spatial distribution of seeds in experimental food patches and quantified foraging behavior by measuring giving-up densities (GUDs: the amount of food remaining in a resource patch following exploitation by a forager). In one experiment, we presented small (< 1.4 mm in diameter cracked wheat). medium (2.0-3.3 mm), and large (> 3.4 mm) seeds in separate trays; in a second, we presented small and medium seeds separately and mixed together. Gerbils had a higher handling lime efficiency on smaller seeds, but a much higher encounter probability on larger seeds (20 times higher on large than medium seeds, and 2-5 times higher on medium than small seeds). This led gerbils to have significantly lower GUDs on larger seeds than smaller seeds and to harvest a higher proportion of the larger seeds. When presented with rich and poor patches G. allenbyi tended to equalize GUDs in both patches, indicating a quitting harvest rate rule For patch exploitation. In contrast. larks appeared to use a fixed time rule for patch exploitation. For larks, seed size did not influence encounter probabilities, and they showed no seed-size selectivity. Still, larks had higher handling efficiencies on smaller than larger seeds, and consequently had a significantly lower GUD on small than medium seeds. Despite large differences between the gerbils and larks in their foraging, our results do not support species coexistence via seed-size partitioning: the larks had much higher GUDs than the gerbils on all seed sizes. Nonetheless, seed size, seed abundance, seed distribution and the animal's patch use behavior all played major roles in determining gerbils' and larks' diet selectivities and GUDs.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Ctr Desert Ecol, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel; Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60607 USA","Kotler, BP (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Mitrani Ctr Desert Ecol, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-84990 Sede Boqer, Israel.",kotler@bgumail.bgu.ac.il,"Garb, Jessica E/J-4566-2015; Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012; Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788",,,,71,46,49,2,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2000,88,2,,,,,291,300,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880207.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,287QV,WOS:000085518000007,,,,,2021-09-27,

Warming temperatures cause temporal changes in growing seasons and prey abundance that drive earlier breeding by birds, especially dietary specialists within homogeneous habitat. Less is known about how generalists respond to climate-associated shifts in growing seasons or prey phenology, which may occur at different rates across land cover types. 2. We studied whether breeding phenology of a generalist predator, the American kestrel (Falco sparverius), was associated with shifts in growing seasons and, presumably, prey abundance, in a mosaic of non-irrigated shrub/grasslands and irrigated crops/pastures. We examined the relationship between remotely-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and abundance of small mammals that, with insects, constitute approximately 93% of kestrel diet biomass. We used NDVI to estimate the start of the growing season (SoGS) in irrigated and non-irrigated lands from 1992 to 2015 and tested whether either estimate of annual SoGS predicted the timing of kestrel nesting. Finally, we examined relationships among irrigated SoGS, weather and crop planting. 3. NDVI was a useful proxy for kestrel prey because it predicted small mammal abundance and past studies showed that NDVI predicts insect abundance. NDVI-estimated SoGS advanced significantly in irrigated lands (beta = 1.09 +/- 0.30 SE) but not in non-irrigated lands (beta = -0.57 +/- 0.53). Average date of kestrel nesting advanced 15 days in the past 24 years and was positively associated with the SoGS in irrigated lands, but not the SoGS in non-irrigated lands. Advanced SoGS in irrigated lands was related to earlier planting of crops after relatively warm winters, which were more common in recent years. 4. Despite different patterns of SoGS change between land cover types, kestrel nesting phenology shifted with earlier prey availability in irrigated lands. Kestrels may preferentially track prey in irrigated lands over non-irrigated lands because of higher quality prey on irrigated lands, or earlier prey abundance may release former constraints on other selective pressures to breed early, such as seasonal declines in fecundity or competition for high-quality mates. 5. This is one of the first examples of an association between human adaptation to climate change and shifts in breeding phenology of wildlife.","[Smith, Shawn H.; Heath, Julie A.] Boise State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 1910 Univ Dr, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Smith, Shawn H.; Heath, Julie A.] Boise State Univ, Raptor Res Ctr, 1910 Univ Dr, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Steenhof, Karen] Owyhee Desert Studies, 18109 Briar Creek Rd, Murphy, ID 83650 USA; [McClure, Christopher J.

While much scientific attention has concerned their biology in life, researchers have yet to examine how their massive carcasses may have influenced the evolution of other dinosaurs in their communities, such as theropods. Theropod consumers local to this faunal system are typically described as powerful apex predators at the top of local food webs, but instead, may have been shaped by competition for carrion resources generated as a byproduct of their giant sauropod neighbors. To test this hypothesis, we wrote a series of agent-based simulations (ABS). Specifically, we simulated allosaurid consumer behavior versus spatially distributed sauropod carcass resources such as could be expected in ecosystems like that represented in the Morrison Formation. We incorporated conditions to test how competition among consumers, seasonality, and predation success influenced carnosaur survival both with and without carrion-abundant systems. Trials of the ABS resulted in a strong selective advantage for allosaurs as obligate scavengers because of the high metabolic and survival costs associated with predation of large vertebrates. Allosaurs with increased predatory success over peers failed to succeed competitively unless the probability of scavenging opportunities fell below a certain threshold and a significant proportion of herbivores were available as prey targets, which might not have been the case in sauropod-dominated systems. Our results may explain why carnosaurs like Allosaurus did not evolve powerful bite forces, binocular vision, or advanced cursorial adaptations. Given the enormous supply of sauropod carrion, they were under no resource-based selective pressure to overpower prey and may have evolved as terrestrial vulture analogues. This also may explain why the absence of sauropods in certain environments led to more obvious predatory adaptations in theropods such as tyrannosaurs. Tyrannosaurs may have been forced to meet their energy budgets by hunting, because non-sauropod carrion production was too low to support them passively.","[Pahl, Cameron C.] Portland State Univ, Sci Res & Teaching Ctr 246, Dept Biol, POB 751, Portland, OR 97207 USA; Portland State Univ, Sci Res & Teaching Ctr 246, Museum Vertebrate Biol, POB 751, Portland, OR 97207 USA","Pahl, CC (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Sci Res & Teaching Ctr 246, Dept Biol, POB 751, Portland, OR 97207 USA.",pahl@ohsu.edu; ruedas@pdx.edu,,,,,,209,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,1872-7026,,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Pyriproxyfen is a juvenile hormone analog that inhibits the emergence of adult mosquitoes by interrupting metamorphosis, but does not target larvae. This mechanism allows natural source of mortality like predation to act in combination with pyriproxyfen to affect mosquito population size. Here, we determined the effects of juvenile exposure to pyriproxyfen and predatory mosquito Toxorhynchites rutilus on adult Aedes aegypti traits, including infection with Zika virus. Combined effects of pyriproxyfen and Tx. rutilus led to strong inhibition of adult emergence in Ae. aegypti. Treatments containing predators or those mimicking the daily mortality of predation produced larger sized adults. Susceptibility to ZIKV infection was lowest in the predator treatment and highest in the pyriproxyfen treatment. Disseminated infection, transmission, and viral titers of ZIKV were similar between treatments. Our data suggest that the combination of pyriproxyfen and predators can enhance inhibition of adult Ae. aegypti emergence, but survivors may have fitness benefits such being larger mosquitoes. Understanding the consequences of control approaches in mosquito-pathogen interactions will assist to evaluate their suitability in mosquito control programs. Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen that can cause global public health threats. In the absence of effective antiviral medications, prevention measures rely largely on reducing the number of adult mosquito vectors by targeting juvenile stages. Despite the importance of juvenile mosquito control measures in reducing adult population size, a full understanding of the effects of these measures in determining mosquito phenotypic traits and in mosquito-arbovirus interactions is poorly understood. Pyriproxyfen is a juvenile hormone analog that primarily blocks adult emergence, but does not cause mortality in larvae. This mechanism has the potential to work in combination with other juvenile sources of mortality in nature such as predation to affect mosquito populations. Here, we experimentally evaluated the effects of juvenile exposure to pyriproxyfen and predatory mosquito Toxorhynchites rutilus on Aedes aegypti phenotypes and susceptibility to ZIKV infection and transmission. We discovered that combined effects of pyriproxyfen and Tx. rutilus led to higher inhibition of adult emergence in Ae. aegypti than observed in pyriproxyfen or Tx. rutilus treatments alone. Adult body size was larger in treatments containing Tx. rutilus and in treatments mimicking the daily mortality of predation compared to control or pyriproxyfen treatments. Susceptibility to infection with ZIKV in Ae. aegypti was reduced in predator treatment relative to those exposed to pyriproxyfen. Disseminated infection, transmission, and titers of ZIKV in Ae. aegypti were similar in all treatments relative to controls. Our data suggest that the combination of pyriproxyfen and Tx. rutilus can inhibit adult Ae. aegypti emergence but may confer a fitness advantage in survivors and does not inhibit their vector competence for ZIKV relative to controls. Understanding the ultimate consequences of juvenile mosquito control measures on subsequent adults' ability to transmit pathogens is critical to fully understand their overall impacts.","[Alomar, Abdullah A.; Eastmond, Bradley H.; Alto, Barry W.] Univ Florida, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Florida Med Entomol Lab, Vero Beach, FL 32962 USA","Alto, BW (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Florida Med Entomol Lab, Vero Beach, FL 32962 USA.",bwalto@ufl.edu,,"Alomar, Abdullah/0000-0002-8708-1442",,,,93,2,2,4,5,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

Rhizosphere protists play a significant role in this respect: considerable efforts have been made in the past to reveal the impact of protist-bacteria interactions on the remobilization of essential nutrients for plant uptake, or the grazing induced changes on plant-growth promoting bacteria and the rootarchitecture. However, the metabolic responses of plants to the presence of protists or to protist-bacteria interactions in the rhizosphere have not yet been analyzed. Here we studied in controlled laboratory experiments the impact of bacterivorous protists in the rhizosphere on maize plant growth parameters and the bacterial community composition. Beyond that we investigated the induction of plant biochemical responses by separately analyzing above- and below-ground metabolite profiles of maize plants incubated either with a soil bacterial inoculum or with a mixture of soil bacteria and bacterivorous protists. Significantly distinct leaf and root metabolite profiles were obtained from plants which grew in the presence of protists. These profiles showed decreased levels of a considerable number of metabolites typical for the plant stress reaction, such as polyols, a number of carbohydrates and metabolites connected to phenolic metabolism. We assume that this decrease in plant stress is connected to the grazing induced shifts in rhizosphere bacterial communities as shown by distinct T-RFLP community profiles. Protist grazing had a clear effect on the overall bacterial community composition, richness and evenness in our microcosms. Given the competition of plant resource allocation to either defense or growth, we propose that a reduction in plant stress levels caused directly or indirectly by protists may be an additional reason for corresponding positive effects on plant growth.","[Kuppardt, Anke; Fester, Thomas; Haertig, Claus; Chatzinotas, Antonis] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Environm Microbiol, Leipzig, Germany; [Chatzinotas, Antonis] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany","Kuppardt, A (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Environm Microbiol, Leipzig, Germany.",anke.kuppardt@ufz.de,"Chatzinotas, Antonis/D-6232-2013","Chatzinotas, Antonis/0000-0002-0387-9802",,,,81,6,7,2,27,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

While the realism of the first assumption is questionable, the second assumption conflicts with the purpose of interference models. Here, we tested a recently developed stochastic version of the Beddington-DeAngelis functional response-which applies to a finite predator population without assuming weak interference-against experimental data of shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) foraging on mussels (Mytilus edulis). We present an approximate maximum likelihood procedure for parameter estimation when only one focal individual is observed, and introduce 'correction factors' that capture the average behaviour of the competing but unobserved individuals. We used the method to estimate shore crab handling time, interaction time, and searching rates for prey and competitor. Especially the searching rates were sensitive to variation in prey and competitor density. Incorporating constant parameter values in the model and comparing observed and predicted feeding rates revealed that the predictive power of the model is high. Our stochastic version of the Beddington-DeAngelis model better reflects reality than current interference models and is also amenable for modelling effects of interference on predator distributions.","[Smallegange, Isabel M.; van der Meer, Jaap] Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res NIOZ, Dept Marine Ecol & Evolut, Den Burg, Netherlands","Smallegange, IM (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Biol, Silwood Pk, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.",i.smallegange@imperial.ac.uk,"van der Meer, Jaap/C-6687-2011; Smallegange, Isabel M./A-8198-2010","Smallegange, Isabel M./0000-0001-6218-7358",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),We would like to thank Maurice Sabelis for constructive comments and discussion.

In some systems, environmental heterogeneity may be the key to understanding the evolution and maintenance of such polyphenisms. I examined the influence of the physical environment on the use of alternative tactics by the damselfly Protoneura amatoria. Male P. amatoria reversibly use 2 tactics to gain matings: 1) sit and wait in the canopy for passing females or 2) hover over the water and attempt to grab females that are ovipositing in floating debris. Observations in 3 streams indicated that the use of the hovering tactic was greater under high-light than low-light conditions and at higher densities of ovipositing females. The density of ovipositing females was correlated with both the light conditions and the availability of oviposition substrate, indicating that physical factors exert indirect as well as direct influences on tactic use. Experimental manipulations showed that both males and females responded directly to light conditions and suggested that males responded directly to the density of ovipositing females. These results can be explained largely in terms of the cues and constraints inherent in different light environments. Thus, the conditional mating strategy of P. amatoria appears to have evolved in response to, and been maintained by, fine-scale variation in the physical environment. These findings are discussed in relation to flight dynamics and predation risk.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Larison, B (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",blarison@ucla.edu,,"Larison, Brenda/0000-0002-0264-7276",,,,56,10,10,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

As a result, we know neither the frequency and extent of herbivore-initiated indirect effects nor the mechanisms that regulate their strength. We examined the effects of ungulates on taxa (plants, arthropods, and an insectivorous lizard) representing several trophic levels, using a series of large, long-term, ungulate-exclusion plots that span a landscape-scale productivity gradient in an African savanna. At each of six sites, lizards, trees, and the numerically dominant order of arthropods (Coleoptera) were more abundant in the absence of ungulates. The effect of ungulates on arthropods was mediated by herbaceous vegetation cover. The effect on lizards was simultaneously mediated by both tree density (lizard micro-habitat) and arthropod abundance (lizard food). The magnitudes of the experimental effects on all response variables (trees, arthropods, and lizards) were negatively correlated with two distinct measures of primary productivity. These results demonstrate strong cascading effects of ungulates, both trophic and nontrophic, and support the hypothesis that productivity regulates the strength of these effects. Hence, the strongest indirect effects (and thus, the greatest risks to ecosystem integrity after large mammals are extirpated) are likely to occur in low-productivity habitats.","Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; Mpala Res Ctr, Nanyuki, Kenya; Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Pringle, RM (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",pringle@stanford.edu,,,,,,47,149,152,1,102,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Hyotheses: Survivorship is influenced by host age. Hosts that suffer parasitoid attack grow. p more slowly and consume fewer prey. Those that survive attack are smaller as adults and show reduced survivorship. Organisms: The aphidophagous hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus, its endoparasitoid wasp Diplazon laetatorius and its prey, the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Site of experiments: All experiments were conducted in controlled temperature rooms and chambers in the laboratory. Methods: Episyrphus balteatus larvae of each instar were exposed to attack by Diplazon laetatorius, then dissected to measure the encapsulation response (a measure of immunity). Second instar larvae were either attacked or not attacked by D. laetatorius. Their development rates and numbers of prey consumed were noted. The size and survivorship of surviving (immune) and control hoverflies were compared following eclosion. Conclusions: Successful immune response increased with larval age (first instar 0%, second instar 40%, third instar 100% survival). Second instar larvae that successfully resisted parasitoid attack were larger as pupae (but not as adults) and showed reduced adult survivorship. Female adult survivors were more likely than male survivors to have died within 16 days of eclosion, but there was no difference between unattacked male and female control hoverflies. Attacked larvae, irrespective of immune status, consumed fewer aphids than unattacked individuals. Episyrphus balteatus suffers significant costs of resisting parasitoid attack, and parasitoid attack can reduce the top-down effects of an insect predator, irrespective of whether the host mounts an immune response or not.","Univ Reading, Sch Anim & Microbial Sci, Reading RG6 6AJ, Berks, England","Fellowes, MDE (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Anim & Microbial Sci, Reading RG6 6AJ, Berks, England.",m.fellowes@reading.ac.uk,"Fellowes, Mark/H-9400-2012","Fellowes, Mark/0000-0001-5431-8637",,,,39,11,11,0,11,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1522-0613,1937-3791,,EVOL ECOL RES,Evol.

In addition, subsidies may have indirect effects on the in situ prey of these consumers. These indirect effects can be either negative (e.g., apparent competition) or positive (e.g., via diet shifts) depending on the relative strength of the predator's functional and numerical responses to prey subsidies. Here we report a numerical response by a lizard (Western fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis) to experimental reductions in the flux of river-derived insects. Initially, equal densities of lizards declined significantly faster in plots in which aquatic insect abundance was reduced by nearly 50% (season average) relative to controls. Abundance and biomass of terrestrial arthropods declined significantly between the start and end of the experiment across treatments. Despite consistently lower lizard abundance in plots with reduced subsidy levels, however, relative declines in the abundance and biomass of in situ terrestrial arthropods (all taxa combined) were not significantly different between reduced- and ambient-subsidy plots. Relative declines in spider biomass differed significantly between treatments and were higher in reduced-subsidy than ambient-subsidy plots, but only over one of three 3-wk sampling intervals. Thus, over the biologically active summer season, aquatic subsidies exerted brief positive or no significant indirect effects on the in situ prey of riparian lizards. These results suggest that, although aquatic insect prey may determine the spatial distribution and local abundance of riparian predators, the effects of increased predator density on in situ prey may be offset by higher per capita predation by these consumers on in situ prey in subsidy-poor relative to subsidy-rich habitats.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Sabo, JL (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Dept Biol, POB 871501, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",john.l.sabo@asu.edu,"Sabo, John L/B-1872-2013",,,,,45,131,133,0,63,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,NOV,2002,83,11,,,,,3023,3036,,10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[3023:NROLTA]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,622AT,WOS:000179624600011,,,,,2021-09-27,

Two recent reviews have compared the performances of different measures of interaction strength using simulations. The goal of obtaining measures of interaction strength is based on the premise that such measures will achieve a closer connection between theory and experiment in community ecology. The present article disputes this premise. Because interactions are typically nonlinear, single numerical measures are generally poor characterizations. Typically, the functional dependencies of growth rates on population densities are unknown. Lacking more information about the form of these functions, the results of most population manipulations make very limited contributions to the construction of dynamic models of communities. Even if all effects of population, densities on per capita growth rates were linear, performing all possible removal experiments will frequently fail to identify the constants of proportionality. Many misconceptions about the meaning and measurement of interaction coefficient persist. More extensive natural history observations and use of more flexible short-term experiments are advocated as approaches that will aid in constructing mathematical models of interspecific interactions.","Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, Toronto, ON M6R 2V6, Canada","Abrams, PA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Zool, 25 Harbord St, Toronto, ON M6R 2V6, Canada.",,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X",,,,45,96,98,3,57,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,AUG,2001,94,2,,,,,209,218,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.940201.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,475PM,WOS:000171173200001,,,,,2021-09-27,

This process, over ecological and geological time scales, comprises a major component of Caribbean reef-building systems. Manipulative experiments showed that as the chiton grazes the alga it stimulates new meristematic activity and removes sporlings of the competitively superior frondose and filamentous algae, thereby increasing the survival rate of P. pachydermum on the intertidal reef crest. Furthermore, in the absence of C. into, overgrowths of frondose and filamentous epiphytes provide an attractive food source for parrotfishes (Scaridae), which accelerates bioerosion of the coralline reef-crest structure due to the deep rasping action of feeding activity. Algal removal experiments suggest that the role of P. pachydermum is to provide a predictable food source and refuge substratum, which increases survivorship of the burrowing chiton by minimizing expenditure of energy during foraging and risk to predation. The chiton/coralline alga association is abundant throughout tropical western Atlantic islands and augments reef-building processes on the shallow algal crest portion of Caribbean reefs. Cover of the Choneplax/Porolithon association in the Belize Barrier Reef cost averages 13% (maximum to 70%) with a mean chiton density of 664 individuals/m(2) within the association. On average, the extensive networks of interconnected chiton burrows extend between 6 and 10 cm deep and contain one C. lata for every six openings, with the majority of animals (66%) ranging from 16 to 30 mm in length. Gut contents of the chiton consist predominantly of P. pachydermum (51%), followed by bacterial detritus (30%), Cyanophyta (13%), Bacillariophyta (3%), and fleshy microalgae (3%). The close SEM (scanning electron microscope) match between radular morphology of C. lata and grazing scars on the thallus surface of P. pachydermum shows how the chiton regularly feeds on the coralline alga without causing mortality. Virtually all P. pachydermum in the vicinity of C., lata burrows contain radular track scars of approximate to 10 mu m in depth, whereas the photosynthetic, meristematic, and reproductive tissues of the coralline lie below 20 mu m P. pachydermum under intense chiton grazing is photosynthetically competent with 0.1 mg C fixed . g(-1) organic dry mass . h(-1), which is not significantly different from ungrazed material and within the range of rates for other crustose coralline algae.

An experiment was conducted to investigate potential impacts of food limitation and copepod predation on juvenile survival of Chaoborus punctipennis. We tested the hypotheses that: (i) juvenile survival of Chaoborus is influenced more by copepod predation than by starvation in a productive environment, and (ii) food limitation and predation interact to affect survival. 2. Effects of food concentration (approximately 800, 1400 and 2300 microzooplankton l-1) and predator density (0, 1 and 2 Mesocyclops edax l-1) on Chaoborus development and survival were evaluated using a 3 X 3 factorial design. Jars containing lake water, the appropriate food and predator treatments, and two Chaoborus (< 12 h old) were rotated on a plankton wheel at 25-degrees-C. Survival and developmental stage were monitored daily until all individuals had either died or moulted to instar II. 3. Predation by Mesocyclops was the major source of mortality, causing 87.5% of Chaoborus deaths over all treatments. Chaoborus mortality was significantly higher in treatments with Mesocyclops (67-100%) than in predator-free treatment (0-13%). 4. Development time was significantly longer in the low-density food treatment than in the highest food treatment. 5. No significant interaction between food limitation and predation was detected. 6. These results suggest that predation by copepods may limit recruitment of juvenile Chaoborus in productive lakes.","WELLESLEY COLL,DEPT BIOL SCI,WELLESLEY,MA 02181",,,,,,,,50,11,11,0,3,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD, OXON, ENGLAND OX2 0EL",0046-5070,,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

Manipulations in 100 cm2 quadrats at each intertidal height involved removal of various components of the sessile macrofauna and macroflora, removal of the total community and a control treatment. The availability of free space on the substratum in each quadrat was measured prior to the onset of settlement to determine whether differences in the density of barnacles among treatments were due to differences in the availability of free space or to manipulation. Where the density of settlers was high, it was positively related to the availability of free space suggesting that settlement was a simple function of the availability of free space. However, the pattern of settlement varied from the onset to the end of settlement: quadrats from which only barnacles had been removed were occupied early in the settlement period and later-arriving larvae were restricted to less favourable sites where free space was available. Thus, settlement preferences may be masked when the supply of larvae is saturating or the duration of the selction experiment is too long. Where the density of settlers was low and free space was non-limiting, there was no relationship between the density of settlers and the availability of free space. In the high intertidal zone at Site A, the density of settlers was greater in treatments with ephemeral algae (wetter quadrats) than in those without (drier quadrats). In general, early post-settlement mortality in treatments where algae had been removed increased with intertidal height, whereas in treatments where algae were present it remained relatively constant among heights. Post-recruitment mortality did not differ significantly among treatments in the high intertidal zone, suggesting that factors which influence selection of the substratum by cyprid larvae and promote early post-settlement survival may be particularly important in determining subsequent population structure of barnacles in this zone. Post-recruitment mortality, mainly due to predation by whelks, was highest in the low intertidal zone at both sites and did not differ significantly between treatments. In the mid intertidal zone at Site B, whelk foraging appeared to be constrained by desiccation stress and post-recruitment mortality was highest in treatments with Fucus spp. Where predation is intense, initial selection of the substratum by cyprid larvae may have little effect on the subsequent population structure of barnacles.","DALHOUSIE UNIV, DEPT OCEANOG, HALIFAX B3H 4J1, NS, CANADA; DALHOUSIE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, HALIFAX B3H 4J1, NS, CANADA",,,,,,,,58,84,84,0,15,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

To examine selected factors, exclusive of large herbivore impacts, a series of acorn seeding experiments was initiated in 1985 in 6 counties on representative sites. At each site, the experimental treatments were the factorial combination of herbs vs. no herbs and screen protection vs. no protection. The experimental design was 4 randomized complete blocks of the herb treatments with each main plot split for the 2 levels of protection. Rainfall and edaphic factors were used to help interpret measures of seedling emergence, survival, and growth. Herbaceous plant control for reduction of moisture stress was the most important factor examined. Emergence was significantly improved by control in nearly 80% of blue oak seedings and in 33% of valley oak seedings. Average first year survival, expressed as a percent of acorns sown, was significantly improved with control in seedings of both blue oak (33% vs. 18%) and valley oak (45% vs. 21%). Limited data suggest the difference in survival remains consistent over time as overall survival declines. With few exceptions, the addition of screen protection discouraged predation and significantly enhanced survival and growth.

The primary cover in the mid-intertidal zone was a mosaic of red algal turf (Corallina officinalis, Gigartina canaliculata, and Gelidium coulteri) and clumps of the mussel Mytilus californianus. In certain circumstances the algae attached to and overgrew the mussels. In other marine habitats, facultative epibionts benefit bivalve hosts by masking them from predators. At Catalina, spiny lobsters (Panulirus interruptus) and oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani) preyed on intertidal mussels. However, in tagging studies, overgrown mussels displayed a nonsignificant trend towards lower survivorship. A factorial experiment manipulating exposure to predators and the cover of epiphytes demonstrated that over-growth significantly reduced survivorship. There was no significant statistical interaction between treatment effects, indicating that the presence of algae did not protect the mussels from predators. Overgrown mussels also had significantly lower rates of growth and reproduction than naturally clear mussels of similar size and location. Experimental removal of the epiphytes caused significant increases in mussel growth and reproduction relative to overgrown controls. In the community circumstances chosen for this study, the epiphytic habit is a part of the processes in which otherwise freeliving algae become dominant on the rock surface.","CALIF STATE UNIV LOS ANGELES, DEPT BIOL, LOS ANGELES, CA 90032 USA",,,,,,,,71,46,48,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,FEB,1991,72,1,,,,,286,296,,10.2307/1938922,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EU723,WOS:A1991EU72300028,,,,,2021-09-27,

Although nest association among Nocomis chubs and other minnows (Cyprinidae) is common throughout North America, the overall outcome of this relationship and its mechanisms of costs and benefits remain unclear. Because imperilment of stream fishes is affected by reproductive traits, the implications of this widespread interaction must be understood. 2. Nest association mechanisms were explored using a multiple working hypotheses framework on fish assemblage data from 25 reaches in three tributaries of the New River, Virginia, USA. Multiple linear regression models predicting reproductive success (age-0 abundance) of chubs and associates were compared based on model weights (w(i)) calculated from Akaike's Information Criterion, adjusted for small sample size (AICc), and relative change in AICc among models. For age-0 chubs, models represented hypotheses emphasizing the additive effects of adult abundance, nest abundance, and egg dilution by juvenile associates (causing decreased egg predation). For age-0 associates, models represented hypotheses emphasizing adult associate abundance, gravel substrate availability, nest abundance, parental care (as nest defence) from chubs, and egg dilution by chubs. 3. Model evidence suggests that chubs can sustain themselves (w=0.61), but their reproductive success is enhanced by a dilution effect from juvenile strong associates (w=0.37). Strong associate reproductive success was best described by variables emphasizing nest association interactions (w=0.46) and natural sources of habitat variability (w=0.45), whereas that of weak associates was more closely related to availability of unmodified habitat (w=0.50). 4. Chubs and associates appear to receive a net benefit from the association, suggesting a mutualistic relationship. Community-wide conservation strategies may be useful for protecting symbiotic spawning fishes. In addition to competition and predation, conservation practitioners should consider positive interactions in conservation plans of imperiled mutualists.

However, hatching cues for anostracan diapausing eggs include factors associated with the filling of temporary pond basins, and desiccation often increases the fraction of eggs that hatch. Thus, it is possible that in some species, eggs dispersed to permanent habitats never hatch, and vertebrate predation is not the proximate factor limiting distributions. We experimentally transplanted live egg-bearing females of the fairy shrimp Branchinecta coloradensis into permanent and temporary ponds in small chambers and allowed the chambers to overwinter in situ. There was no discernible effect of pond drying on hatching success (mean success = 50.9%). We also determined whether metamorphic salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum) could disperse viable fairy shrimp eggs by feeding on B. coloradensis in one pond and defecating in another. Hatching success for a salamander ingested treatment was estimated as 0.9%. Results of a third experimental treatment suggested that the eggs being carried by females were not fully mature, so that ingestion resistance might vary throughout the reproductive period of B. coloradensis. By combining these results with data on salamander movement and diet, we estimated salamander-mediated dispersal rates for fairy shrimp eggs. Metamorphic A. tigrinum nebulosum sp. are likely to be dispersing thousands of B. coloradensis eggs among ponds annually. Because our results demonstrate that dispersal between ponds can occur in large numbers, they support the prevailing hypothesis that vertebrate predators Limited to permanent ponds are the proximate mechanism preventing the invasion of fairy shrimp.","Cornell Univ, Ecol & Systemat Sect, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Rocky Mt Biol Labs, Crested Butte, CO 81224 USA; Murray State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Murray, KY 42071 USA","Bohonak, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Ctr Conservat Res & Training, 3050 Maile Way,Gilmore 409, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",,,,,,,37,85,87,0,24,AMER SOC LIMNOLOGY OCEANOGRAPHY,WACO,"5400 BOSQUE BLVD, STE 680, WACO, TX 76710-4446 USA",0024-3590,,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR,Limnol.

We suggest three major factors that could explain why tree agamas are favoured in this peri-urban landscape in the face of human persecution: firstly, predators such as snakes and raptors are likely to occur at a much lower density in peri-urban areas; secondly, their primary prey (insects) may be more abundant or accessible in this landscape; thirdly, they may experience less competition for resources.","[Whiting, Martin J.; Chetty, Kinesh; Twine, Wayne] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa; [Twine, Wayne] Wits Rural Facil, Acornhoek, South Africa; [Carazo, Pau] Univ Valencia, Lab Etol, Inst Cavanilles Biodiversidad & Biol Evolut, Valencia, Spain","Whiting, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Wits, South Africa.",martin.whiting@wits.ac.za,"Twine, Wayne/AAD-9299-2019; Carazo, Pau/B-3311-2011; Whiting, Martin J./E-2999-2010","Carazo, Pau/0000-0002-1525-6522; Whiting, Martin J./0000-0002-4662-0227; Twine, Wayne/0000-0002-4163-198X",National Research Foundation of South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa; University of the Witwatersrand; National Lottery Distribution Trust Fund; cooperation of the Timbavati community,"This study was funded by grants to MJW from the National Research Foundation of South Africa and the University of the Witwatersrand.

Some walleye anglers have reported reductions in the quality of walleye fisheries since the introduction of smallmouth bass and attribute this to the consumption of young walleyes by smallmouth bass and competition for shared prey resources. We quantified the diets of walleyes and smallmouth bass in the lower reaches of Lake Sharpe (a Missouri River reservoir), calculated the diet overlap between the two predators, and determined whether they partitioned shared prey based on size. We also quantified walleye diets in the upper reach of the reservoir, which has a different prey base and allowed us to compare the growth rates of walleyes within Lake Sharpe. Age-0 gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum composed a substantial proportion of the diets of both predators, regardless of location, for most of the growing season; the patterns in shad vulnerability appeared to drive the observed patterns in diet overlap. Smallmouth bass appeared to consume a smaller size range of gizzard shad than did walleyes, which consumed a wide range. Smallmouth bass consumed Sander spp. in some months, but in very low quantities. Given that global climate change is expected to alter the population and community dynamics in Great Plains reservoirs, we also used a bioenergetics approach to predict the potential effects of limiting prey availability (specifically, the absence of gizzard shad and rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax) and increased water temperatures (as projected from global climate change models) on walleye and smallmouth bass growth. The models indicated that the absence of rainbow smelt from the diets of walleyes in upper Lake Sharpe would reduce growth but that the absence of gizzard shad would have a more marked negative effect on both predators at both locations. The models also indicated that higher water temperatures would have an even greater negative influence on walleye growth; however, smallmouth bass growth was predicted to increase with higher temperatures. Fisheries managers should consider strategies to enhance the prey base or mitigate the effects of increased water temperatures that may occur in the future as a result of global climate change. Such proactive actions may alleviate potential future competition between walleyes and smallmouth bass resulting from changes in the fish community.","[Wuellner, Melissa R.; Willis, David W.] S Dakota State Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, Brookings, SD 57007 USA; [Chipps, Steven R.] S Dakota State Univ, US Geol Survey, S Dakota Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Brookings, SD 57007 USA; [Adams, Wells E., Jr.] Missouri River Fisheries Ctr, Ft Pierre, SD 57532 USA","Wuellner, MR (corresponding author), S Dakota State Univ, Dept Wildlife & Fisheries Sci, No Plains Biostress 138,Box 2140B, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.",melissa.wuellner@sdstate.edu,"Willis, David W/D-3400-2009",,Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration [F-15-R],"We greatly appreciate the field efforts of South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks biologists and technicians.

A review of the densities, feeding and foraging ecology, as well as the relations between the large carnivores in the arid Kalahari, illustrates how they have successfully adapted to arid conditions, and highlights some of the differences in these relationships with those in more mesic areas. In the arid Kalahari, the relative densities of the large carnivores are more even, but community structure is different, with the inclusion of the brown hyaena (Hyaena brunnea) and the disappearance of the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus). Resource partitioning is more acute and diet flexibility is evident. The relative contribution to animals killed by predation is more equitably shared by the predator community, and high rates of food loss by smaller carnivores to larger ones has not been recorded. There is even an example of a smaller carnivore (brown hyaena) deriving benefits from a larger one (lion, Panthera leo). Arid regions are clearly important areas for large carnivores and more attention should be given to research and conservation of carnivores in arid areas.",,"Mills, MGL (corresponding author), POB 7814, ZA-1206 Sonpark, South Africa.",mills.gus@gmail.com,,,SANParks; University of Pretoria; Lewis Foundation,"The field work was conducted under the auspices of SANParks, the University of Pretoria and the Lewis Foundation.

Most often the invalid analysis consists of use of an (n+1)-way anova in a situation where two or more n-way anovas would be the appropriate approach'. I and my students examined a total of 1362 papers published from the 1960s to 2009 reporting manipulative experiments, primarily in the field of ecology. The error was present in 7% of these, including 9% of 80 experimental papers examined in 2009 issues of Ecology and the Journal of Animal Ecology. Key features of 60 cases of pseudofactorialism are tabulated as a basis for discussion of the varied ways and circumstances in which the error can occur. As co-authors, colleagues, editors and anonymous referees and editors who approved them for publication, a total of 459 persons other than the senior authors shared responsibility for these 60 papers. Pseudofactorialism may sometimes be motivated by a desire to test whether different response variables respond in the same way to treatment factors. Proper procedures for doing that are briefly reviewed. A major cause of pseudofactorialism is the widespread failure in statistics texts, primary literature and documentation for statistics software packages to distinguish the three major components of experimental design - treatment structure, design structure, response structure - and clearly define key terms such as experimental unit, evaluation unit, split unit, factorial and repeated measures. A quick way to check for the possible presence of the pseudofactorialism is to determine whether the number of valid experimental units in a study is smaller than (i) the error degrees of freedom in a multi-way anova; or (ii) the total number of tallies (N) in a multi-way contingency table. Such situations also can indicate the commission of pseudoreplication, however.","San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA","Hurlbert, SH (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",shurlbert@sunstroke.sdsu.edu,,,,,,140,19,20,1,76,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,1442-9993,,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,SEP,2013,38,6,,,,,646,663,,10.1111/aec.12010,,,18,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,202FQ,WOS:000323199500005,,Green Published,,,2021-09-27,

In poikilotherms, ambient temperature is one of the most important environmental factors with a direct link to a variety of fitness-related traits. Recent empirical evidence suggests that individual differences in boldness are linked to behavioral thermoregulation strategy in heliothermic species, as individuals are regularly exposed to predators during basking. Here, we tested for links between behavioral thermoregulation strategy, boldness, and individual state in adult males of the high-mountain Carpetan rock lizard (Iberolacerta cyreni). Principal component analysis revealed the following latent links in our data: (i) a positive relationship of activity with relative limb length and color brightness (PC1, 23% variation explained), (ii) a negative relationship of thermoregulatory precision with parasite load and risk-taking (PC2, 20.98% variation explained), and (iii) a negative relationship between preferred body temperature and relative limb length (PC3, 19.23% variation explained). We conclude that differences in boldness and behavioral thermoregulatory strategy could be explained by both stable and labile state variables. The moderate link between behavioral thermoregulatory strategy and risk-taking personality in our system is plausibly the result of differences in reproductive state of individuals or variation in ecological conditions during the breeding season.","[Horvath, Gergely; Herczeg, Gabor] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Systemat Zool & Ecol, Behav Ecol Grp, Pazmany Peter Setany 1-C, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Jimenez-Robles, Octavio] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Jimenez-Robles, Octavio; De la Riva, Ignacio] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Biodivers & Evolutionary Biol, Madrid, Spain; [Martin, Jose; Lopez, Pilar] CSIC, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Madrid, Spain","Horvath, G (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Systemat Zool & Ecol, Behav Ecol Grp, Pazmany Peter Setany 1-C, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",gergohorvath@caesar.elte.hu,"Horvath, Gergely/Q-1119-2018; Herczeg, Gabor/AAZ-1661-2021; Martin, Jose/B-1073-2014","Horvath, Gergely/0000-0002-0485-333X; Herczeg, Gabor/0000-0003-0441-342X; Martin, Jose/0000-0001-6648-3998; De la Riva, Ignacio/0000-0001-5064-4507","Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi AlapprogramokOrszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA) [OTKA-K 105517]; Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [MICIIN-CGL2011-30393]; SYNTHESYS [ES-TAF-3104]; Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Fund [PD-132041, SNN-125627]; Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [MINECO-CGL2014-53523-P]","Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok, Grant/Award Number: OTKA-K 105517; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Grant/Award Number: MICIIN-CGL2011-30393; SYNTHESYS, Grant/Award Number: ES-TAF-3104; Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Fund, Grant/Award Number: PD-132041; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Grant/Award Number: MINECO-CGL2014-53523-P; Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Fund, Grant/Award Number: SNN-125627",,136,1,1,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

To assess flexibility in the foraging tactics of a marine bird, we investigated the diets and foraging behaviour of the largest seabird predator in the North Atlantic Ocean. Northern gannets Sula bassana exploit abroad spectrum of pelagic prey that range in mass by more than 2 orders of magnitude, We investigated their foraging activity at their largest. offshore colony in the western Atlantic Ocean during 1998 to 2002, when they preyed primarily on shoals of spawning and post-spawning capelin Mallotus villosus, a small forage fish (similar to 15 g), and also on a much larger pelagic fish, post-smolt Atlantic salmon Salmo salar (similar to 200 g). Inter-annual dietary variation is associated with gannet and prey fish distributions. Landings of capelin at the colony by gannets were correlated with returns of larger foraging flocks from inshore, whereas landings of Atlantic salmon were associated with smaller flocks returning from offshore. Maximum foraging trip distances ranged from 20 to 200 km and averaged 57 +/- 12 (SE) km, consistent with distances to inshore capelin aggregations. When capelin abundance was low (in 2002), more gannets foraged offshore, preyed on large pelagic fishes (mostly Atlantic salmon) and exhibited the greatest dietary diversity. Though the Outbound portions of foraging trips were more sinuous than inbound routes, individual gannets exhibited general fidelity to foraging sites. These large avian predators used flexible foraging tactics to adjust to changing prey conditions and generate longer-term strategies to Lake advantage of diverse trophic interactions over a range of ocean ecosystems.","[Montevecchi, W.

In estuaries, salinity and turbidity directly influence the distribution of organisms but the indirect, synergistic effects of these factors on trophic interactions and community structure remain obscure. We investigated the effects of salinity and turbidity on oyster reef communities by comparing oyster reef community structure in low vs. high turbidity in consecutive years that varied considerably in rainfall and ambient salinity levels. Turbidity had significant effects in both 2016 and 2017 by interfering with fish foraging ability and consumption. In turbid sites, fish predation decreased by -21%, crab mesopredators were 11% larger and nearly 5 times more abundant due to reduced top-down control by fish, and oyster reef biodiversity was 12% lower. In 2016, oysters were 350% less abundant in sites with abundant crab predators. However, in 2017, salinity increased, facilitating a new predator (oyster drills Stramonita haemastoma) to emerge onto reefs, and oysters were 7 times less abundant in sites with oyster drills despite having fewer crab predators. Thus, salinity and turbidity can indirectly affect food webs by facilitating different predators and influencing their sensory performance. Turbidity had significant effects on estuarine food webs regardless of salinity levels, and like salinity, turbidity should also be considered in oyster reef restoration and management of estuarine ecosystems.","[Reustle, Joseph W.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Life Sci, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA; [Smee, Delbert L.] Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, Dauphin Isl, AL 36695 USA","Reustle, JW (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Life Sci, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA.",jreustle@tamucc.edu,"Reustle, Joey/AAR-3416-2021","Reustle, Joey/0000-0001-7307-9993",NSF GRFPNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1645635],"We thank the Studies in Marine Ecology and Evolution (SMEE) lab, M.

We developed a spatially explicit model that uses agent-based modeling techniques to simulate the interactions between damselfish and sea urchins on an eastern Pacific coral reef following an El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event where high echinoid abundances and low coral cover were prevalent. Our modeling study suggests that the agonistic behavior of damselfish towards echinoids invading their defended algal lawn territories has a magnifying effect on the degree of bioerosion attributed to echinoids. This is due to the increased likelihood that sea urchins ejected from damselfish territories will form concentrated aggregations and remain grazing and eroding coral for longer periods of time. This is a novel insight that contrasts with the previous understanding of the positive effect that damselfish have on reef carbonate budgets by protecting carbonate substrates that lie within their defended algal lawn territories. The increased degradation of coral stands attributed to the indirect damselfish effect, if it results in sea urchins eroding subsurface coral framework structures, causing instability and collapse (especially during periods of high-water motion), may contribute to the fracturing of large portions of coral framework blocks, affecting the recovery trajectory of reefs following a severe El Nino disturbance event.","[Glynn, Peter J.] Crane Country Day Sch, 1795 San Leandro Lane, Santa Barbara, CA 93108 USA; [Glynn, Peter W.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Mate, Juan] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado Postal 0843-03092, Panama City, FL USA; [Riegl, Bernhard] Nova Southeastern Univ, Halmos Coll Nat Sci & Oceanog, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, 8000N Ocean Dr, Dania, FL 33004 USA","Glynn, PJ (corresponding author), Crane Country Day Sch, 1795 San Leandro Lane, Santa Barbara, CA 93108 USA.",pglynn@craneschool.org,,,"U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-1447306, OCE9314798]; Smithsonian Tropical Research InstituteSmithsonian InstitutionSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute","P.W.

We found a dramatic decline in juvenile numbers between emergence from the natal burrow and the onset of hibernation. From 2005 to 2007, an average 70.6% of all juveniles disappeared from the population (n = 168 males and 224 females), including a 72.0% loss of males and 65.2% loss of females (chi(2)(1) = 2.1, P > 0.10). Weekly loss of juvenile males peaked 3-4 w after emergence while female loss remained relatively stable through summer. Radio-tracking enabled us to eliminate dispersal as a cause of the decline in juvenile numbers. Predation accounted for at least 71.4% of mortalities in radio-collared juveniles (66.7% of males and 76.0% of females; chi(2)(1) = 0.087, P > 0.75). We found no sex differences in specific behaviors that could predispose one sex to predation, but males were less wary than females in response to a potentially frightening stimulus.","[Freeman, P.

Animals are thought to evolve smaller clutches of larger offspring on islands in response to release from predation pressure and interspecific competition, and the resulting increases in population density and intraspecific competition. These forces become more pronounced with diminishing island size, and life histories are thus expected to become slowest on small, isolated islands. We measured clutch sizes in 12 insular populations of Mediodactylus kotschyi, a small gecko from the Cyclades Archipelago, a set of land-bridge islands in the Aegean Sea (Greece). We analyse variation in clutch size in relation to island area, island age, maternal body size, the presence of putative competitors and nesting seabirds (which increase resource abundance in the form of marine subsidies), and richness of predators. Clutch size of M. kotschyi decreases with increasing island area, in departure from classic island syndrome predictions, suggesting the evolution of faster life histories on smaller islands. There are no relationships between clutch size and island age, maternal size, the presence of competitors or predator richness. Instead, larger clutches on small islands could simply reflect the beneficial effect of marine subsidies derived from resident seabird colonies. Indeed, populations of M. kotschyi on islands with nesting seabirds have clutch sizes 30.9 % larger (1.82 vs. 1.39 eggs) than populations on islands without nesting seabirds. Thus, our data suggest that bottom-up effects of marine subsidies may supersede the expression of a simple island syndrome in the Aegean M. kotschyi.","[Slavenko, Alex; Itescu, Yuval; Meiri, Shai] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Foufopoulos, Johannes] Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Pafilis, Panayiotis] Univ Athens, Sch Biol, Dept Zool & Marine Biol, Panepistimiopolis, Ilissia, Greece","Slavenko, A (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Zool, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel.",slavenko@mail.tau.ac.il,"Slavenko, Alex/ABC-7200-2020; Meiri, Shai/D-2403-2010","Slavenko, Alex/0000-0002-3265-7715; Foufopoulos, Johannes/0000-0002-8341-8271; Meiri, Shai/0000-0003-3839-6330; Pafilis, Panayiotis/0000-0002-1832-4906",Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [1005/12],"We thank Nir Enav, Gaya Savyon, Stav Brown, Shani Levinkind, Amir Lewin, Maayan Mania and Rachel Schwarz for their invaluable help in the field.

Explanations for the integration of migratory and non-migratory (resident) birds in the Neotropics have been complicated by the paradox that arthropod abundances are low when bird abundances reach their annual peak. The breeding currency hypothesis offers an explanation for this paradox by postulating that resident birds are limited in the breeding season by the availability of large arthropods suitable for reproduction, whereas the carrying capacity of all birds in the non-breeding season is limited by the availability of arthropods suitable for self-maintenance of adults. 2. Field data from Jamaica supported this hypothesis. Among 19 sites, the ratio of migrant to resident bird abundance was correlated negatively with the ratio of large arthropod biomass in the breeding season to total arthropod biomass in the non-breeding season. 3. However, after controlling for effects of arthropod seasonality, migrant to resident bird abundance ratios were higher in human-disturbed than undisturbed sites. 4. Other factors may interact with the availability of food for nestlings to limit the populations of resident birds below carrying capacities set by non-breeding season arthropod abundance, thereby creating a set of resources available to non-breeding migrants.","Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA","Johnson, MD (corresponding author), Humboldt State Univ, Dept Wildlife, Arcata, CA 95521 USA.",mdj6@humboldt.edu,,,,,,59,31,32,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

CRUSTACEA; PREDATION; REPLACEMENT; PULEX; TRANSMISSION; CANNIBALISM; COMPETITION; INFECTION; DISEASE; BIOLOGY,"The microsporidian parasite, Pleistophora mulleri, infects the abdominal muscle of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus duebeni celticus. We recently showed that P. mulleri infection was associated with G. d. celticus hosts being more vulnerable to predation by the invasive amphipod Gammarus pulex. Parasitized G. d. celticus also had a reduced ability to prey upon other co-occurring amphipods. We suggested the parasite may have pervasive influences on host ecology and behaviour. Here, we examine the association between P. mulleri parasitism and parameters influencing individual host fitness, behaviour and interspecific interactions. We also investigate the relationship between parasite prevalence and host population structure in the field. In our G. d. celticus study population, P. mulleri prevalence was strongly seasonal, ranging from 8.5% in summer to 44.9% in winter. The relative abundance of hosts with the heaviest parasite burden increased during summer, which coincided with high host mortality, suggesting that parasitism may regulate host abundance to some degree. Females were more likely to be parasitized than males and parasitized males were paired with smaller females than unparasitized males. Parasitism was associated with reduction in the host's activity level and reduced both its predation on the isopod Asellus aquaticus and aggression towards precopula pairs of the invasive G. pulex. We discuss the pervasive influence of this parasite on the ecology of its host.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol & Biochem, Ctr Med Biol, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; Univ Leeds, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, Sch Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England","MacNeil, C (corresponding author), Govt Lab, Ballakermeen Rd, Douglas 1M1 4BR, Man, England.",,,"Dunn, Alison/0000-0002-4855-1077",,,,24,26,26,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA",0031-1820,,,PARASITOLOGY,Parasitology,SEP,2005,131,,3,,,,331,336,,10.1017/S0031182005007754,,,6,Parasitology,Parasitology,970MZ,WOS:000232315600006,16178354,,,,2021-09-27,

This study evaluated the influence of the small-scale spatial distribution of artificial modules on infaunal community structure and associated it with the hydrodynamic and geochemical characteristics of the surrounding sediments and with fish predation pressure. Reefballs (TM) were placed on a sandy bottom on the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro in modules with a triangular set configuration with side lengths of 0.5, 5 and 15 m. The availability of potential macrobenthic prey for the reef-associated fish community was evaluated using gillnets for each inter-module distance. The input of organic matter and fine sediment into the reef complex during the rainy season favored deposit feeders. Shorter distances showed reduced fine sediment and nutrient deposition and, consequently, a lower density of deposit feeders in the infauna compared with more distant modules, which had a greater number of predators and suspension feeders. The surrounding infauna responded positively to the grain-size composition. This result suggests that transient fishes use the artificial reefs for purposes such as shelter, nursery and breeding habitats. Shifts in infaunal structure reflected the physical disturbance following the deployment of the artificial reefs and the seasonal variations but did not respond to the spatial design, showing the importance of these configuration variables and their influence on the associated infaunal community.

The effect of turbulence on the feeding efficiency of an ambush predator was tested with laboratory experiments. The experiments were conducted in 100-L aquaria in which ten individuals of fourth instar Chaoborus flavicans larvae were placed as predators. Two prey densities (3 and 10 ind. of Daphnia pulex L-1) and two durations (30 and 120 min) were tested in a nonturbulent treatment and five different turbulence levels [average root-mean-square (RMS) velocities ranging from 0 to 7.3 cm s(-1), corresponding dissipation rates from 7.2 x 10(-7) to 1.3 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-3)]. We hypothesized that the feeding rate of C. flavicans would be enhanced by turbulence due to increasing encounter rates up to a turbulence level above which a disturbance in post-encounter processes would lead to reduced feeding efficiency. However, the results showed no significant increase in the feeding rate of C. flavicans at intermediate turbulence. At high turbulence we found the expected significant negative response in the feeding rate of Chaoborus larvae. The feeding rate declined below the rates at nonturbulent and intermediate turbulence conditions as the average RMS velocity exceeded 3.1 cm s(-1) (dissipation rate 9.9 x 10(-5) m(2) s(-3), respectively).","[Harkonen, Laura; Pekcan-Hekim, Zeynep; Hellen, Noora; Horppila, Jukka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Harkonen, L (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",laura.harkonen@helsinki.fi,,"Harkonen, Laura/0000-0003-1399-5978",Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [131579],"The study was financed by the Academy of Finland (project 131579).

The results indicate that these transgenic fish possess an elevated ability to compete for limited food resources, which could be advantageous after an escape into the wild. It may be that other factors in the natural environment (i.e. predation risk and food distribution), however, would offset this advantage.

This study tests whether wild tufted capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella nigritus) use alarm calls in a functionally deceptive manner to usurp food resources. If capuchins use alarm calls 'deceptively', it was predicted that false alarms should be: (i) given by subordinates more than by dominants, (ii) more frequent when food is most contestable, (iii) more frequent when less food is available, and (iv) given when the caller is in a spatial position in which it could increase its feeding success if conspecifics react to the call. These predictions were tested by observing subjects in experimental contexts, in which the amount and distribution of a high-value resource (banana pieces) were manipulated using wooden platforms suspended from tree branches. While false alarms were non-significantly more common when more food was available, the three remaining predictions were supported. These results generally support the hypothesis that alarm calls are used by capuchins to reduce the effects of feeding competition. Whether this is intentional on the part of the caller requires further investigation.","SUNY Stony Brook, Interdepartmental Doctoral Program Anthropol Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Wheeler, BC (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Interdepartmental Doctoral Program Anthropol Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",bcwheeler43@gmail.com,,,"American Society of Primatologists; Wenner-Gren Foundation [7244]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0550971, BCS-0515007]; National Geographic Society Committee on Research and ExplorationNational Geographic Society","Funding was provided by the American Society of Primatologists, the Wenner-Gren Foundation (grant no. 7244), the National Science Foundation (DDIG nos 0550971 and BCS-0515007 to C.

These models can be applied to nearly any situation in which consumers compete-by any mechanism-for resources that are patchily distributed in their environment. Although IFD models have come to be broadly accepted, experiments that simultaneously test more than a single prediction are rare. Instead, investigators normally either test (1) for a relationship between the distribution of consumers and the distribution of resources or (2) whether average fitnesses are equal across resource patches. We conducted experiments with pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris) feeding on two patches of fava beans (Vicia faba L.) to fully independently parameterize an IFD model with interference competition and then test quantitative predictions about aphid spatial distributions and the payoffs of patch choice. We found a precise fit between aphids' predicted and observed reproductive successes. Furthermore, by varying patch quality in two ways, we were able to show that aphid distributions vary with the mode of resource variation in the predicted manner: aphids (1) matched resources when patches varied in size but not quality and (2) overmatched the good patch when patches varied in quality but not size (predicted as a consequence of weak interference). The close correspondence between quantitative predictions of the model with observed behaviors suggests that IFD theory is a framework with more explanatory power than is generally appreciated.","Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Cornell Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Univ Texas, Sect Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Flaxman, SM (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, 106A Guyot Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",sflaxman@princeton.edu,,/0000-0002-6238-1174,,,,49,14,14,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

We exposed individual guppy (Poecilia reticulata) females either to larger females, smaller females or held them alone for five weeks. All replicates had visual access to a sexually mature mate. At the end of the experiment, there were no significant differences in daily growth or mass between the three treatments. However, females held alone had a higher reproductive output (in terms of ovary weight and GSI) than females held with either larger or smaller companions. This was mainly caused by a higher number of fully developed eggs in the ovaries of these females. The total number of eggs (including all stages) did not differ between the treatments. We suggest that the 'extra' energy not used in reproduction in the competitive treatments might have been spent on interactions between the females. In guppies socialising with other females seems to impose a cost on female reproduction.","Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Program Teacher Educ, NTNU, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; Gothenburg Univ, Dept Marine Ecol, Kristineberg Marine Res Stn, S-41124 Gothenburg, Sweden; Univ Oulu, Dept Zool, FIN-90570 Oulu, Finland","Borg, AA (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Program Teacher Educ, NTNU, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",asa.borg@plu.ntnu.no,,"Amundsen, Trond/0000-0003-4261-0555",,,,64,10,10,0,16,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,1568-539X,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,JUN,2006,143,,6,,,,747,761,,10.1163/156853906777791324,,,15,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,080EX,WOS:000240231800006,,,,,2021-09-27,

The first assumption has been upheld by studies showing the beneficial nature of plasticity. The second assumption is difficult to test since it requires knowing about selection acting in the past. However, it can be tested in its general form by asking whether natural selection currently acts to maintain phenotypic plasticity. We adopted this approach in a study of plastic morphological traits in larvae of the wood frog, Rana sylvatica. First we reared tadpoles in artificial ponds for 18 days, in either the presence or absence of Anax dragonfly larvae (confined within cages to prevent them from killing the tadpoles). These conditioning treatments produced dramatic differences in size and shape: tadpoles from ponds with predators were smaller and had relatively short bodies and deep tail fins. We estimated selection by Anax on the two kinds of tadpoles by testing for non-random mortality in overnight predation trials. Dragonflies imposed strong selection by preferentially killing individuals with relatively shallow and short tail fins, and narrow tail muscles. The same trails that exhibited the strongest plasticity were under the strongest selection, except that tail muscle width exhibited no plasticity but experienced strong increasing selection. A laboratory competition experiment, testing for selection in the absence of predators, showed that tadpoles with deep tail fins grew relatively slowly. In the cattle tanks, where there were also no free predators, the predator-induced phenotype survived more poorly and developed slowly, but this cost was apparently not associated with particular morphological trails. These results indicate that selection is currently promoting morphological plasticity in R. sylvatica, and support the hypothesis that plasticity represents an adaptation to variable predator environments.

As a single variable, the gillnet catch per unit effort (CPUE) of R. rutilus was negatively related to the mean mass of small (< 200 mm) and the growth rate of young (1-2 years) P. fluviatilis. The mean mass of large (>= 200 mm) P. fluviatilis was the highest at intermediate CPUE of R. rutilus. Redundancy analysis including environmental factors and P. fluviatilis population variables suggested that 'predation-productivity-humus' gradient affected P. fluviatilis populations by decreasing the CPUE and mean mass of small individuals but increasing these variables of large individuals. The CPUE of R. rutilus and lake area had a negative effect on small and a positive effect on large P. fluviatilis growth rate. In small boreal forest lakes, P. fluviatilis populations are affected by the partially opposite forces of competition by R. rutilus and predation by E. lucius, and the intensity of these interactions is regulated by several environmental factors.","[Olin, M.; Vinni, M.; Lehtonen, H.; Saulamo, K.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Rask, M.; Ruuhijarvi, J.] Evo Fisheries Res Stn, Finnish Game & Fisheries Res Inst, FIN-16970 Evo, Finland; [Ala-Opas, P.] Lammi Biol Stn, FIN-16900 Lammi, Finland","Olin, M (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Environm Sci, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",mikko.olin@helsinki.fi,"Olin, Mikko/I-9258-2012",,Bergsradet Bror Serlachius Stiftelse foundation,We thank all the field-workers for an excellent job and J.

Mast seeding is an important resource pulse in deciduous forests; these boom and bust cycles of seed production generate strong lagged population responses by post-dispersal seed predators such as rodents, which then cascade through multiple trophic levels and regulate population dynamics of their predators and prey. However, similar interactions in another major pulsed system, coniferous forests, are inconsistent, and the effects of interannual variation in conifer seed production on many consumer populations are largely unknown. We used large-scale manipulation and intensive monitoring to examine the population dynamics of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) in relation to fall seed production by two northern conifers, white spruce (Picea glauca) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). Previous studies have shown that spruce seeds are a preferred food source of mice, while fir seeds are generally avoided if other foods are available. Therefore, we expected that there would be a positive relationship between mouse demography and previous spruce seed production, but no effect of fir mast seeding. Supplementation of a mouse population using spruce seeds indicated that increased fall spruce seed availability can enhance overwinter survival and population densities in the following spring, summer, and fall. However, long-term population monitoring indicated that mouse demography was not positively affected by spruce mast seeding, likely due to strong interspecific competition with the North American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudoniscus), a dominant pre-dispersal spruce seed predator. Conversely, we observed an unexpected delayed effect of fir mast seeding, where increased fall fir seed production did not influence overwinter or spring mouse demography, but instead enhanced summer survival, body masses and pregnancy rates of overwintered adults. This led to increased summer population densities and may have been mediated by population responses of invertebrate post-dispersal seed predators to increased fir seed availability. Our results indicate that rodent responses to resource pulses in coniferous forests are more complex than in deciduous environments and reveal previously unobserved direct and indirect consumer-resource dynamics that require further examination. This system is ideal for the large-scale, integrative ecosystem studies that ecologists are encouraged to pursue.","[Lobo, Nikhil; Millar, John S.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada","Lobo, N (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",nlobo3@uwo.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,"We are grateful to the BC Ministry of Forests and Range Tree Seed Centre for donating the white spruce seeds used in this study, the graduate students and research assistants who helped collect data in the field, and L.

To overcome these challenges, non-invasive methods were used to monitor rhinoceros in two sections of Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa, namely Addo and Nyathi. These sections were separated by a public road, and the numbers of elephants, predators and tourists were higher in Addo. Faecal samples (n = 231) were collected (from July 2007 to November 2010) from known individuals and analysed for progestagen and androgen metabolite (FPM and FAM, respectively) concentrations. As biotic factors could impact reproduction, we predicted that demographics, FPM and FAM would vary between sections and with respect to season (calendar and wet/dry), climate and age of the rhinoceros. Mean FPM concentrations from pregnant females were seven times higher (P < 0.05) than samples from non-pregnant rhinoceros. Positive relationships were found between monthly temperatures and FPM from non-pregnant females (r(2) = 0.25, P = 0.03) and the percentage of calves born (r = 0.609, P = 0.04). Although FAM peaked in the spring, when the majority of calves (40%) were conceived, no seasonal patterns in male androgen concentrations were found with respect to month of conception and parturition. Females in Addo had a longer inter-calving interval and were less likely to be pregnant (P < 0.05) compared with those in Nyathi. The biotic stressors (e.g. predators and more competitors) within Addo section could be affecting the reproductive physiology of the rhinoceros negatively. Enhanced knowledge about how black rhinoceros populations respond to environmental stressors could guide management strategies for improving reproduction.","[Freeman, Elizabeth W.] George Mason Univ, New Century Coll, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Meyer, Jordana M.; Santymire, Rachel M.] Lincoln Pk Zoo, Dept Conservat & Sci, Chicago, IL USA; [Bird, Jed; Adendorff, John] Addo Elephant Natl Pk, South African Natl Pk, Addo, South Africa; [Schulte, Bruce A.] Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Biol, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA","Freeman, EW (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, 4400 Univ Dr,MS 5D3, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",efreeman@gmu.edu,"Meyer, Jordana M./AAE-8368-2021",,South African National Parks; George Mason University; Lincoln Park Zoo,"We wish to thank Thando Mendela, Margaret Hook ( WKU) and Malgorzata Wisniewska ( WKU), as well as game guide drivers from AENP and the Gorah, Nguni and Riverbend conservancies for their invaluable assistance gathering faecal samples and field data.

For nest-breeding fishes, nest site availability is a crucial resource that has been found to affect local sexual selection regimes and thus breeding systems. In this study, we compared the availability and size distribution of nest sites and their consequences for habitat preference, fish distributions and the breeding system in sand gobies (Pomatoschistus minutus) breeding in two different habitats. The usual breeding sites of sand gobies are shallow sandy beaches, but here we report their breeding in a novel environment, on rocky bottoms. We found obvious differences between the two habitats. The density of occupied nests was nearly 50 times higher in rock habitat than on sand bottoms. However, competition for nest sites was stronger on sand; nearly all natural nest sites found were in use and empty nest sites were occupied at a much higher rate on sand than in rock habitat. In addition to the numerical differences, nests were larger and contained more eggs in rock habitat than in sand habitat. Moreover, we found significant habitat-specific differences in fish size distribution. The intensity of intrasexual competition as a result of the degree of nest site availability explains the observed patterns within the habitats, but not between them. These habitat-related differences are better explained by the larger average size of nests on rocky bottoms. The effect of nest size on habitat preference was confirmed experimentally by laboratory experiments. When nest size did not differ between the habitats, gobies originating in the two environments showed an equal preference for the sand habitat.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Ecol & Systemat, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Lehtonen, T (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Ecol & Systemat, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",kai.lindstrom@helsinki.fi,"/B-5479-2008; Lehtonen, Topi/A-6679-2010; Lindstrom, Kai/ABG-4353-2020","/0000-0002-8356-5538; Lehtonen, Topi/0000-0002-1372-9509; Lindstrom, Kai/0000-0002-8356-5538",,,,46,29,29,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2004,104,2,,,,,327,335,,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12489.x,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,772NV,WOS:000188848900010,,,,,2021-09-27,

We surveyed young-of-year and older juveniles at 191 sampling sites over 39 sampling areas considerably expanding the known depth range and geographic limits of benthic recruitment. Young-of-year densities were strongly correlated in space with the abundance of older juveniles, signifying consistently strong settlement in the Gulf of Maine, lower Bay of Fundy, southwestern Nova Scotia and southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, and relatively weak settlement in southern New England, eastern coastal Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, a pattern consistent with commercial lobster harvests. Passive collectors elucidated bathymetric patterns of young-of-year recruitment in oceanographically contrasting regions. Although we observed young-of-year lobsters as deep as 80 m, they were most abundant above the thermocline in summer-stratified regions, such as the western Gulf of Maine and southern New England, and depth-wise differences were less extreme in thermally mixed waters of the eastern Gulf of Maine-Fundy region, a finding consistent with previous observations that postlarvae concentrate above the thermocline. Between the two samplers, we detected no sampling bias for young-of-year lobsters, although collectors may slightly under-represent older juveniles entering from the surrounding sea bed. Finally, we found that interactions between juvenile lobsters and suspected predators or competitors in collectors, such as crabs and fishes, are weak and unlikely to bias collector results.","[Wahle, Richard A.; Bergeron, Charlene] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Darling Marine Ctr, Walpole, ME 04573 USA; [Tremblay, John] Dept Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Wilson, Carl] Maine Dept Marine Resources, Boothbay Harbor, ME USA; [Burdett-Coutts, Victoria] Mem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NF, Canada; [Comeau, Michel] Dept Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Moncton, NB, Canada; [Rochette, Remy] Univ New Brunswick, St John, NB E2L 4L5, Canada; [Burdett-Coutts, Victoria; Lawton, Peter] Dept Fisheries & Oceans Canada, St Andrews, NB, Canada; [Glenn, Robert] Massachusetts Div Marine Fisheries, New Bedford, MA USA; [Gibson, Mark] Rhode Isl Div Fish & Wildlife, Jamestown, RI USA","Wahle, RA (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Darling Marine Ctr, Walpole, ME 04573 USA.",richard.wahle@maine.edu,"Wahle, Richard/AAI-3047-2020","Rochette, Remy/0000-0003-3390-8413",US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Northeast Consortium; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Fisheries and Oceans Canada; Fishermen and Scientists Research Society; Community-University Research for Recovery Alliance,"Long-term and broad geographic analyses are predicated on a large group of dedicated scientific support teams and industry participants.

Such neighbourhood effects can have important evolutionary consequences as they may either promote the evolutionary stability of plant defences or, alternatively, select against the fixation of plant defences and instead promote a stable polymorphism of palatable and unpalatable plants. These consequences depend on whether the difference in herbivore damage between unpalatable and palatable plants is smaller or, alternatively, greater when the neighbours are unpalatable instead of palatable. Such relations can arise when the neighbourhood effects are non-parallel among palatable and unpalatable plants. We outline two basic situations of non-parallel neighbourhood effects and illustrate how they can come about. A detailed dissection of these interactions reveals that there are several qualitatively distinct mechanisms that promote either evolutionary stability of plant defences or alternatively polymorphism. Our classification of mechanisms can be used to clarify and explain observations obtained in the field of plant herbivore interactions and predator prey interactions, both at the population and the community level.","[Rautio, Pasi] Stockholm Univ, Tovetorp Zool Res Stn, SE-64050 Bjornlunda, Sweden; [Bergvall, Ulrika A.; Leimar, Olof] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Bergvall, Ulrika A.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Tuomi, Juha; Kesti, Kari] Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland","Rautio, P (corresponding author), Finnish Forest Res Inst, No Unit, Etelaranta 55, FI-96300 Rovaniemi, Finland.",pasi.rautio@metla.fi,"Rautio, Pasi/A-6595-2013; Leimar, Olof/L-3781-2014","Rautio, Pasi/0000-0003-0559-7531; Leimar, Olof/0000-0001-8621-6977","Academy of FinlandAcademy of FinlandEuropean Commission [213235, 80486]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [621-2010-5437]",JT and PR were financially supported by the Academy of Finland (projects 213235 and 80486) and OL was supported by the Swedish Research Council (project 621-2010-5437).

A small frog in eastern Brazil, Phyllodytes luteolus (Wied-Neuwied, 1824), is widely distributed in association with bromeliads. At the end of the last glaciation, parts of the mainland became islands due to rising sea levels, thereby isolating frog populations on these islands. If the island rule holds, we predicted that frogs on islands would tend to be larger than frogs on the mainland. We compared sizes (weight and length) of 30 randomly selected male frogs from the mainland with 30 from an island in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. We also sampled population density on the island and mainland because concurrent with changing sizes, depending on the causal relationship, density may also change. As predicted, island frogs tended to be larger (both in snout-vent length and weight) and were much more abundant. While not specifically addressed in this study, the absence of predators and interspecific competitors may explain both of these trends.","[Mageski, Marcio; Ferreira, Rodrigo B.; Jesus, Paulo R.; da Costa, Larissa C.; Roper, James J.] Univ Vila Velha, Dept Ecol Ecossistemas, BR-29102920 Vila Velha, ES, Brazil; [Ferreira, Paulo D.] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Gemol, BR-29075710 Vitoria, ES, Brazil","Mageski, M (corresponding author), Univ Vila Velha, Dept Ecol Ecossistemas, Rua Comissario Jose Dantas de Melo 21, BR-29102920 Vila Velha, ES, Brazil.",marcioherpetologia@gmail.com,"Roper, James Joseph/H-7986-2012","Roper, James Joseph/0000-0002-2947-5136; Ferreira, Rodrigo/0000-0001-6099-5116; Corteletti, Larissa/0000-0002-2821-2561",Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Espirito Santo (FAPES); Universidade Vila Velha (UVV); Ecology Center at Utah State University; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [231020/2013-9],"We are grateful to Shai Meiri, Renato Feio and Rute Carvalho for their comments and great suggestions and Elaine Campinhos, Mariana Mageski, Rebeka Ferreira, Werther Krohling and Weslley Rangel for their help in the field.

In this study, we compare the morphology and foraging behavior in New Holland Honeyeaters (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) between Kangaroo Island and the South Australian mainland. We (1) provide descriptive information on morphology traits across populations to test previously described differences; (2) test the prediction that island birds will have a wider foraging niche, different use of foraging substrate, and different foraging techniques, and (3) test for evidence of reduced prey diversity on islands as evidenced by longer foraging time. The results provide support for the predictions. Island birds were larger than the mainland birds in tarsus (2.5%) and bill length (3.7%), had a wider foraging niche (mostly due to greater insect consumption), and foraged more from the bark and air (sallying). Consistent with other studies of island biogeography, at least one common mainland predator and several bird species are absent from Kangaroo Island, which may facilitate niche expansion in the island birds. A wider niche could also be favored by lower prey diversity on islands (a depauperate community): in this study, island birds had longer foraging times than mainland birds, which may be evidence for lower total prey density.","[Myers, Steven; Brown, Geoffrey; Kleindorfer, Sonia] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 5042, Australia","Kleindorfer, S (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Bedford Pk, Adelaide, SA 5042, Australia.",sonia.kleindorfer@flinders.edu.au,,"Kleindorfer, Sonia/0000-0001-5130-3122",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council; Birds for Biodiversity program and the Conservation Council of South Australia,"This study was funded by the Australian Research Council.

However, the short-term benefits of priority access to resources have not always translated into long-term benefits in terms of growth and survival. In the present study, we test whether dominant Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) that were able to monopolize a food source in laboratory conditions had a growth advantage over subordinates in their natural stream. There was no relationship between initial size and rank, and high-ranking individuals showed no growth advantage over subordinates over a 2-month period when returned to the wild. A fish's growth rate in the wild was also unrelated to its sex or initial size, or the density of other salmon of the same age class within each experimental site. There was, however, spatial variability in growth, with salmon in one site gaining twice as much weight as did fish from the other sites. This suggests that at most of the sites, resources were limited in availability and that the absence of a relationship between growth and dominance rank was not owing simply to an excess of food being available. The lack of a positive correlation between social status and growth in the wild may be explained by several mechanisms, including the spatio-temporal variability in resources, interspecific interactions, fluctuations in habitat, or the presence of predators.","Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Fish Biol Grp, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; Fisheries Res Serv Freshwater Lab, Pitlochry PH16 5LB, Perthshire, Scotland; Cardiff Sch Biosci, Cardiff CF10 3TL, S Glam, Wales","Harwood, AJ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, W Vancouver Lab, 4160 Marine Dr, W Vancouver, BC V7V 1N6, Canada.",andrewh@interchange.ubc.ca,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009; Griffiths, Sian/A-5240-2010; Brennan, Shea/A-9877-2010; Metcalfe, Neil B./C-5997-2009","Metcalfe, Neil B./0000-0002-1970-9349; Armstrong, John/0000-0003-2015-0500; Griffiths, Sian/0000-0001-6348-7352",,,,47,56,57,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Food web theory predicts that the responses of subsidized consumers are a key to understanding the net impacts of spatial subsidies on in situ prey/resources of recipient systems. However, less is known about the factors triggering the cascading biotic interactions across coupled ecosystems. Here, we quantify how riverine productivity (donor system) mediates terrestrial food web interactions through spatial subsidies to simplified gravel bar communities. Our comparative study in Japan indicated that higher algal biomass in aquatic systems led to increased supplies of emerging aquatic insects, which were associated with greater densities of terrestrial consumers (Carabid beetles) and enhanced consumption rates of supplemental in situ prey on gravel bars. Our results highlight the potential of donor productivity to drive cascading biotic interactions across coupled ecosystems. Because cross-system energy flows should originate, at least in part, from primary producers of donor systems, our fundamental finding may form the basis of future studies exploring the driving factors of cross-system trophic interactions.","[Terui, Akira] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 140 Gortner Lab,1479 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Terui, Akira; Nakamura, Futoshi] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Dept Forest Sci, Kita Ku, Kita 9,Nishi 9, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan; [Negishi, Junjiro N.; Watanabe, Nozomi] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Environm Earth Sci, N10W5, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan","Terui, A (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, 140 Gortner Lab,1479 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.; Terui, A (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Dept Forest Sci, Kita Ku, Kita 9,Nishi 9, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan.",hanabi0111@gmail.com,"Terui, Akira/O-8285-2018; Nakamura, Futoshi/A-6696-2012","Terui, Akira/0000-0003-3774-2844; ","Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism of Japan","We are grateful to B.

Survival of a population can be influenced by foraging success that is determined by ecological and physiological factors. Foraging in air-breathing marine vertebrates is constrained by the duration of their dives, which is in part determined by their oxygen stores. Such organisms are excellent models to study how and when physiology limits behaviour and the associated role of ecological factors such as seasonal change. 2. The Galapagos sea lion (GSL) Zalophus wollebaeki is endangered and its population is declining. Previous work found that GSL exhibited three distinct foraging strategies during a warm season when resources are less abundant, possibly caused by intraspecific competition. 3. We examined adult female GSL diving behaviour during a cold, productive season compared to a warm season to test the hypothesis that they would converge onto one foraging strategy as a consequence of increased productivity. We investigated intra and inter-seasonal changes in GSL oxygen stores during a warm (March 2005, n = 11) and cold season (August-September 2006, n = 12) at Caamano Islet, Galapagos. 4. GSL exhibited persistence of three foraging strategies during the cold, productive season similar to those found during the warm season. This suggests that intraspecific competition associated with limited resources in this area of the Galapagos Islands is maintained throughout the year. 5. GSL exhibited contrasting seasonal changes in their oxygen stores. During the warm season haemoglobin (Hb) and blood volume (Bv) were significantly higher while myoglobin (Mb) was significantly lower compared to that in the cold season. Given that diving behaviour was similar between seasons, these changes are attributed to other causes such as pregnancy as most females were pregnant during the cold season. 6. GSL exhibited physiological plasticity within each season that was attributed to dive behaviour. Oxygen stores of the three foraging strategies, increased according to dive durations: haematocrit, Hb and Mb during the warm season and Hb, Mb and Bv during the cold season. 7. Knowledge of an organism's physiological plasticity is important to assess its vulnerability to climate change. We document for the first time inter and intraseasonal physiological response coupled with diving behaviour in the same sex and age class of an air-breathing diving vertebrate.","[Villegas-Amtmann, Stella; Costa, Daniel P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Long Marine Lab, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","Villegas-Amtmann, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Long Marine Lab, 100 Shaffer Rd, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.",stella@biology.ucsc.edu,"Costa, Daniel/E-2616-2013","Costa, Daniel/0000-0002-0233-5782","Sloan, Packard and Moore FoundationsAlfred P.

Furthermore, we investigated feeding on zooplankton by these two species in suspended culture conditions and compared them with previously published results of their feeding on zooplankton in the natural benthic environment. Experimental studies were conducted in Mali Ston Bay (Adriatic Sea) from December 2009 to December 2010. Differences were observed in terms of survival of tagged M. barbatus and A. noae-specimens of M. barbatus exhibited much better survival rates both in suspended culture and in on-bottom cages than did A. noae. Growth of A. noae under both culture conditions was essentially negligible, while M. barbatus grew several times faster in suspended culture than on the bottom. Values for the growth constant K and L (inf) for M. barbatus in suspended culture were 0.45 year(-1) and 55.9 mm, while corresponding values for on-bottom culture were 0.09 year(-1) and 58.6 mm, respectively. Zooplankters were present in the stomachs of 86.3 % of M. barbatus and 86.4 % of A. noae. Most abundant taxa were bivalve larvae followed by tintinnids, copepods, unidentified eggs and gastropod larvae. In conclusion, this study clearly shows that M. barbatus is a promising candidate for suspended aquaculture in southern Croatia.","[Peharda, Melita; Ezgeta-Balic, Daria; Vrgoc, Nedo] Inst Oceanog & Fisheries, Split 21000, Croatia; [Davenport, John] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Cork, Ireland","Peharda, M (corresponding author), Inst Oceanog & Fisheries, Setaliste Ivana Mestrovica 63, Split 21000, Croatia.",melita@izor.hr; ezgeta@izor.hr; j.davenport@ucc.ie; vrgoc@izor.hr,"Peharda, Melita/G-9426-2017; Balic, Daria Ezgeta/G-9440-2017","Peharda, Melita/0000-0002-9486-9633; Balic, Daria Ezgeta/0000-0003-0763-3647",Croatian 'Unity Through Knowledge' [3A],"This research was financed and supported by the Croatian 'Unity Through Knowledge' grant 3A Bivalve feeding, competition and predation-what is at play''.

Their reproductive success is affected mainly by predation. The most important predator on blackbird nests is the Marsh Wren (Cistothorus palustris), which breaks blackbird eggs and kills small nestlings. We examined whether colonial nesting in Yellow-headed Blackbirds may represent an adaptation to reduce Marsh Wren predation. Marsh Wren predation may be reduced by (1) mutual nest defense by adult blackbirds, (2) predator satiation or dilution, or (3) selfish-herd effects. We tested these hypotheses using experimental nests and found that their safety increased with decreasing distance to the nearest blackbird nest and with increasing density of simultaneously active blackbird nests located nearby. Safety also was higher for nests placed inside a blackbird colony rather than outside. These findings support the nest-defense hypothesis. We also found that Marsh Wrens are capable of destroying a whole blackbird colony in a few days, and that colony size is not correlated with nest safety. These results suggest that the satiation or dilution benefits are negligible. Finally, we found that central nests are safer than peripheral nests in a blackbird colony, but not in an artificial colony, providing weak support for the selfish-herd hypothesis. We conclude that nest predation is reduced mainly by mutual nest defense of adult birds and may represent an important selective force favoring colonial nesting in this species.

Thus, coping with changes in food availability is one of the most crucial behavioural and physiological processes in wildlife. Food intake is a key concept in animal ecology that is directly conditioned by food quality and abundance or diet choice, but may also vary according to individual-related factors (e.g. foraging behaviours, social rank or energy-demanding periods) and the influence of the endocrine system on energy metabolism. Here, we studied food intake in relation to individual characteristics (sex, breeding condition and age) and whether steroid hormones (testosterone and corticosterone metabolites) mediate food intake in wild wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus). Field work was carried out in February-March 2014 in Monte de Valdelatas (Madrid, Spain). Wood mice were live-trapped for 10 consecutive days in four independent plots. Traps were baited with 4g of toasted corn and food intake was calculated by subtracting the remaining bait found inside traps. Fresh faecal samples from 130 different wood mice were collected and faecal testosterone and corticosterone metabolites (FTM and FCM, respectively) were analysed by enzyme immunoassays. Food intake was higher in females than males, probably due to greater energy requirements. Non-breeders and young individuals also showed a higher food intake. These individuals usually hold a lower social rank which is associated to limited food resources because of dominants; thus, increased food intake may be a result of freely exploit food bait inside traps while avoiding risky competition. In addition, food intake negatively correlated with FTM levels and positively with FCM levels indicating that both hormones have an active role mediating food intake in the wood mouse. Our data suggest that food intake is a function of both individual traits and the endocrine system that accordingly respond throughout different energy-demanding periods.","[Navarro-Castilla, Alvaro; Sanchez-Gonzalez, Beatriz; Barja, Isabel] Univ Autonomous Madrid, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Ethophysiol Grp,Unit Zool, C Darwin 2,Campus Univ Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Barja, Isabel] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Ctr Invest Biodiversidad & Cambio Global CIBC, C Darwin 2, E-28049 Madrid, Spain","Navarro-Castilla, A (corresponding author), Univ Autonomous Madrid, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Ethophysiol Grp,Unit Zool, C Darwin 2,Campus Univ Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",alvaro.navarrocastilla@inv.uam.es,"Navarro-Castilla, Alvaro/M-7315-2018","Navarro-Castilla, Alvaro/0000-0003-0928-3978",Spanish Ministry of Education and ScienceSpanish Government [AP2008-03430],ANC was supported by a FPU scholarship from the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science (grant number AP2008-03430).,,65,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0028-1042,1432-1904,,SCI NAT-HEIDELBERG,Sci.

There was a tendency toward increased settlement of hard clam larvae with increasing density of gem clams. Microscopic examination showed that increased settlement did not result from trapping or entanglement in sticky secretions from gem clams. Enhanced settlement in the presence of gem clams was persistent in both gently aerated and recirculated waters, and in both sand and muddy sand, suggesting that M mercenaria larvae could recognize settlement cues associated with G. gemma in various habitats and hydrodynamic conditions. Preferential settlement in sediment previously exposed to gem clams indicates that gem clams alter sediment in some way to make it attractive for larval settlement. In addition, increased settlement in the presence of empty gem clam shells in sediment suggests that settlement cues are properties of the shell, although the nearly significant settlement with gravel particles suggests that physical cues, such as grain size and bottom roughness, may play a role. Thus, this study demonstrates dense assemblages of small suspension feeders can enhance larval settlement of another bivalve species.","SUNY, MARINE SCI RES CTR, STONY BROOK, NY 11794 USA; KOREA OCEAN RES & DEV INST, POLAR RES CTR, SEOUL 425600, SOUTH KOREA; OREGON STATE UNIV, OREGON SEA GRANT INST, CORVALLIS, OR 97331 USA",,,,,,,,51,10,10,0,1,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

We investigated the motivation and decision-making to forage in captive bushveld gerbils (Gerbilliscus leucogaster) using an individually tailored experimental protocol. Individual gerbils were subjected to 4 experiments, where we assessed behavior and decision-making in response to: (a) food quality when resources were clumped (Experiment 1), (b) food quality when resources were scattered (Experiment 2), (c) changing food distribution (clumped vs. scattered; Experiment 3), and (d) predation risk. Each experiment comprised 4 treatments, where both cost (a weighted door) and incentive (preferred vs. nonpreferred seeds; clumped vs. scattered seeds) varied according to the mass and personal preferences of individual gerbils. We counted the number of seeds eaten, assessed the frequency of door usage, and measured the duration of exploration, vigilance, and foraging (as a proportion of total time) of gerbils in each experiment. Gerbils showed individual preferences for different seed types although all preferred sunflower or sorghum seeds. Generally, gerbils ate more seeds and used the door more frequently when the costs were low. Similarly, gerbils tended to forage more when the costs were low and predation risk was low. We also found that males, in general, were more vigilant than females in Experiments 3 and 4, likely because of risk of intrasexual competition over a high-resource patch. There was considerable individual variation in behavior, but there was also consistency in most behaviors, indicating that individual gerbils perform consistently differently to other gerbils.","[Rymer, Tasmin L.; Cruise, Megan; Pillay, Neville] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Rymer, Tasmin L.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Rymer, Tasmin L.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia","Pillay, N (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",neville.pillay@wits.ac.za,"Rymer, Tasmin/P-3555-2019","Rymer, Tasmin/0000-0002-9963-6345; Pillay, Neville/0000-0002-0778-726X","National Research Foundation, South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa [80567]; University of the Witwatersrand","The authors declare no conflict of interest.

We looked for evidence of genetic adaption in a population of the water flea Daphnia pulex that faced a novel, introduced predator, Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), selectively preying upon large zooplankton. Theory predicts adaptive changes towards a faster life history. We compared growth, age and length at maturation, egg size, and fecundity of two groups of clones kept in common-garden conditions, 13 clones isolated at around the time of the perch introduction and 14 isolated 3 years after. All animals were photographed daily and observed every third hour to detect maturation and measure the clutch size. Post-introduction clones matured earlier, but this was an indirect response triggered by genetic change in growth: post-introduction clones had faster growth prior to maturation than pre-introduction ones, reaching earlier the size threshold for maturation, but the threshold itself remained unchanged. Post-introduction clones showed also higher clutch size for 2nd and 3rd clutch, and slower growth from maturation (first appearance of eggs) to the moult after the release of the first clutch. Egg size did not differ between the periods. The experiment shows how life-history responses to predation involve multiple interlinked traits and both direct and indirect genetic responses.","[Wathne, Ingrid; Enberg, Katja; Jensen, Knut Helge; Heino, Mikko] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol Sci, Box 7083, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Enberg, Katja; Heino, Mikko] Inst Marine Res, Box 1870, N-5817 Bergen, Norway; [Heino, Mikko] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Heino, Mikko] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 106, Taiwan","Wathne, I (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Biol Sci, Box 7083, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",ingrid.wathne@uib.no,"Enberg, Katja/C-8630-2009; Heino, Mikko/C-7241-2009","Enberg, Katja/0000-0002-0045-7604; Heino, Mikko/0000-0003-2928-3940","University of Bergen; Bergen Research Foundation; Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), R.O.C.

In generalist predators in particular, individual diet specialization is likely to have important consequences for food webs. Understanding individual diet specialization empirically requires the ability to quantify individual diet preferences accurately. Here we compare the currently used frequentist maximum likelihood approach, which infers individual preferences using the observed prey proportions to Bayesian hierarchical models that instead estimate these proportions. Using simulated and empirical data, we find that the approach of using observed prey proportions consistently overestimates diet specialization relative to the Bayesian hierarchical approach when the number of prey observations per individual is low or the number of prey observations vary among individuals, two common features of empirical data. Furthermore, the Bayesian hierarchical approach permits the estimation of point estimates for both prey proportions and their variability within and among levels of organization (i.e., individuals, experimental treatments, populations), while also characterizing the uncertainty of these estimates in ways inaccessible to frequentist methods. The Bayesian hierarchical approach provides a useful framework for improving the quantification and understanding of intraspecific variation in diet specialization studies.","[Coblentz, Kyle E.; Novak, Mark] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Rosenblatt, Adam E.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Coblentz, KE (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",kyle.coblentz@oregonstate.edu,"Coblentz, Kyle/AAU-5549-2021; Novak, Mark/E-2194-2012","Coblentz, Kyle/0000-0002-0069-8491; Novak, Mark/0000-0002-7881-4253",NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1314109]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1353827],"We thank members of the NovakLab, Paul Conn, and an anonymous reviewer for critical comments and feedback that improved the manuscript.

Few studies have attempted to study the relative importance of these factors considered simultaneously. In this study we tested the hypotheses that hare population density is regulated by bottom-up (food), top-down (predation) or abiotic factors including tidal floods and climatic conditions. We related data on hare population density on a relatively isolated island to changes in surface area of suitable vs. unsuitable vegetation for forage, predator densities, flooding parameters and climatic variables. During the study period (1996-2012), hare numbers decreased from 580 to 219. Estimated population density was positively correlated with the cover of short, intermediate successional vegetation types and was negatively correlated with the cover of tall, late successional vegetation types. These findings corroborate results from earlier experimental studies that reported a strong aversion of hares to tall vegetation. Additionally, we found indications that raptor population density and unusually high floods also exerted negative effects on hare population density. We conclude that bottom-up factors (the availability of suitable forage) are the main regulators of the studied hare population. This suggests that the importance of bottomup effects has been underestimated and could explain leporid population decline in areas that have experienced a similar increase in tall, unsuitable vegetation.","[Schrama, Maarten] Univ Manchester, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England; [Schrama, Maarten; Veeneklaas, Roos M.; Bakker, Jan P.] Univ Groningen, Community & Conservat Ecol, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands; [Kuijper, Dries P.

In many gregarious caterpillars, collective use of a network of silk trails is thought to improve foraging. Grouping, i.e., close contact with conspecifics, has been postulated to have both positive (thermoregulation and predator defense) and negative (competition and pathogen transmission) effects. The present experiment distinguishes between silk produced by group members and grouping per se in their effects on growth and development of both early and late larval stadia of the forest tent caterpillar [Malacosoma disstria Hubner (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae)] in a laboratory context. For both developmental stadia tested, pre-established silk trails decreased latency to food finding and hence increased food consumption and growth rate. For younger larvae, pre-established silk also decreased investment in silk production. Grouping young caterpillars accelerated development at the expense of growth, possibly as a mechanism to avoid intraspecific competition in later larval stadia. In older caterpillars, grouping decreased meal duration, suggesting that competition can indeed occur towards the end of larval development, even in the presence of surplus food. This led to a decrease in growth without any effect on instar duration. The benefits of exogenous silk thus decreased during larval development, whereas the costs associated with crowding increased. Ontogenetic shifts in grouping are common in many taxa: the present study is among the first to provide empirical evidence for an adaptive explanation of observed ontogenetic changes in aggregative behavior.","Concordia Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada","Despland, E (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Biol, 7141 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H4B 1R6, Canada.",despland@alcor.concordia.ca,"Despland, Emma/ABI-5924-2020",,,,,36,35,35,3,21,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-8703,,,ENTOMOL EXP APPL,Entomol.

Apparently, trophic cascades are more frequently reported from freshwater than from marine plankton. We argue that this difference is real and mainly caused by biological differences at the zooplankton-phytoplankton link: cladocerans (particularly Daphnia) in the lakes and copepods in the sea. We derive these conclusions from recent literature and a number of own, similarly designed mesocosm experiments conducted in a lake, a brackish water and a marine site. In all experiments, phytoplankton were exposed to gradients of experimentally manipulated densities of zooplankton, including freshwater copepods and cladocerans, and marine copepods and appendicularians. The suggested reasons for the difference between lake and marine trophic cascades are: (1) Both copepods and cladocerans suppress only part of the phytoplankton size spectrum: cladocerans the small and copepods the large phytoplankton. (2) If not controlled by grazing, small phytoplankton may increase their biomass faster than large phytoplankton. (3) Copepods additionally release small phytoplankton from grazing pressure by intermediate consumers (protozoa) and competitors (predation on appendicularian eggs), while cladocerans do not release large phytoplankton from grazing pressure by any functional group. (4) Cladocerans sequester more of the limiting nutrient than copepods, leaving fewer nutrients available for compensatory growth of ungrazed phytoplankton.","Leibniz Inst Marine Sci, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; Danish Inst Fisheries Res, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark","Sommer, U (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Marine Sci, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",usommer@ifm-geomar.de; fso@dfu.min.dk,,,,,,88,168,177,2,115,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,MAR,2006,147,2,,,,,183,194,,10.1007/s00442-005-0320-0,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,011ME,WOS:000235271600001,16341887,,,,2021-09-27,

We call this method phenotypic engineering. To the extent that natural selection moulds organisms on a trait-by-trait basis, we would expect fitness of unmanipulated (control) individuals to be higher than that of experimentally altered individuals. However, other outcomes are possible and of interest. If, for example, a single trait were altered and the fitness of manipulated and unmanipulated organisms were found to be similar, we might conclude that selection is not currently operating on the altered trait. Phenotypic engineering with hormones describes an experimental approach to the study of adaptive variation in suites of traits that are hormonally mediated and correlated in their expression. A likely outcome of such manipulations is that some traits would be altered so as to elevate fitness but that changes in other, correlated traits would lower fitness. If the net effect were to depress fitness, a process by which natural selection shapes and maintains organisms as integrated units would be demonstrated. We have employed this approach in studies of the Dark-eyed Junco Junco hyemalis, a small passerine whose reproductive success varies with the abundance of nest predators. We treated males with testosterone, documented the phenotypic consequences and related these to various measures of fitness. Summarizing results to date: Behavioural comparison of males treated with testosterone (T-males) and control males (C-males) shows that T-males sing more frequently, are less attentive to offspring, have larger home ranges and are more attractive to females. Physiologically, testosterone accelerates entry into breeding condition in spring (loss of winter lipid stores) and results in higher levels of corticosterone. If exposure to testosterone is prolonged beyond the breeding season, pre-basic moult is delayed or prevented. We are currently comparing T- and C-males with respect to corticosteroid binding proteins, sperm reserves, response to nestling vocalizations and neuroanatomy. The relationship between testosterone-induced phenotypic variation and fitness is still under study. When treatment extends well beyond the breeding season, testosterone significantly reduces survivorship; otherwise it does not. With respect to apparent reproductive success (i.e. estimates of paternity that are not based on genetic analysis), more young leave the nests of C-males than of T-males, but treatment groups do not differ in the number of young that reach independence. Preliminary data on realized reproductive success (i.e. number of genetic offspring sired) suggest that production as the result of extra-pair fertilizations is greater in T- than in C-males but that T-males lose paternity of more of the offspring of their social mates to other males. Continued investigation will, we hope, reveal the factors governing the trade-offs between male mating effort and parental effort and between survival and current reproduction, as well as the frequency with which the typical phenotype outperforms one that has been experimentally altered.","INDIANA UNIV, CTR INTEGRAT STUDY ANIM BEHAV, BLOOMINGTON, IN 47405 USA; BALL STATE UNIV, DEPT PHYSIOL & HLTH SCI, MUNCIE, IN 47306 USA; OHIO STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA; JAMES MADISON UNIV, DEPT MATH, HARRISONBURG, VA 22801 USA","Ketterson, ED (corresponding author), INDIANA UNIV, DEPT BIOL, BLOOMINGTON, IN 47405 USA.",,,,,,,127,176,177,0,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0019-1019,1474-919X,,IBIS,Ibis,JAN,1996,138,1,,,,,70,86,,,,,17,Ornithology,Zoology,TU907,WOS:A1996TU90700008,,,,,2021-09-27,

About 75 % of the fish stock was removed (425 000 kg fish). The fish was mainly composed of bream and roach. In May 600000 young pikes (3-4 cm) were introduced. In May 1991 the water became very clear (Secchi depth 1.8 m) during a spring bloom of large Daphnia. Then the grazing by zooplankton was eight times higher than the primary production of algae and the total suspended matter concentration became very low. Compared to the situation before the fish reduction, the grazing had increased only slightly, while the primary production had decreased significantly in early spring. The fish stock reduction might have contributed to the reduction in primary production by a reduced internal nutrient load. The clear water period lasted six weeks. Daphnia disappeared in July due to food limitation, the algal biomass increased and the Secchi depth became 50 cm. Daphnia did not recover during summer, due to predation that was not caused by 0 + fish but by the mysid shrimp Neomysis integer. Neomysis could develop abundantly, because of the reduced biomass of the predator perch. The production of young fish had been low because of the cold spring weather. The cold weather was probably also responsible for the slow increase in density of macrophytes. After 1991, perch probably can control Neomysis. Due to lack of spawning places and shelter for 0 + pike, pike was probably not able to control the production of 0 + fish. In a lake of this scale, it will not be easy to get more than 50% coverage of macrophytes, which seems necessary to keep the algal biomass low by nutrient competition. Therefore, we expect also in the future a decrease in transparency in the summer. Locally, especially near Characeae, the water might stay clear.","WITTEVEEN & BOS, 7400 AE DEVENTER, NETHERLANDS; RWS, DIRECTIE FLEVOLAND, 8200 AP LELYSTAD, NETHERLANDS; CTR LIMNOL, 3631 AC NIEUWERSLUIS, NETHERLANDS","MEIJER, ML (corresponding author), RIZA, POB 17, 8200 AA LELYSTAD, NETHERLANDS.",,"van Nes, Egbert H/F-2681-2011; Gulati, Ramesh D/F-4943-2013; Gulati, Ramesh D./A-3155-2011","van Nes, Egbert/0000-0002-6345-104X",,,,37,31,31,1,12,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,FEB 25,1994,275,,,,,,31,42,,10.1007/BF00026697,,,12,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,NB198,WOS:A1994NB19800004,,,,,2021-09-27,

The study also assessed the theoretical influence of density dependence and cannibalism during immature stages, on the population dynamics of the species. The survival curves were similar, indicating that populations of C. albiceps exhibit the same pattern of survival among life stages. A strong nonlinear trend was observed, suggesting density dependence, acting during the first life stages of C. albiceps. The time-series simulations produced chaotic oscillations for all life stages, and the cannibalism did not produce qualitative changes in the dynamic behavior. The bifurcation analysis shows that for low values for survival, the population reaches a stable equilibrium, but the cannibalism results in chaotic oscillations practically over all the parametric space. The implications of the patterns of dynamic behavior observed are discussed.","[Godoy, W. A.

In species lacking any physical means to inflict injuries upon combatants, such as butterflies, the factors determining mating success are less clear. Against this background, we explored the determinants of male mating success in the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana Butler (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Satyrinae), by comparing physiological, immunological, and morphological traits between winning and losing males. Our results showed that successful males are characterized by a better flight performance, evidenced by having longer wings, a heavier thorax, a lighter abdomen, a higher fat content, and higher phenoloxidase expression levels than their unsuccessful counterparts, when being compared after their first mating. Males that won three consecutive trials against the same combatant were also characterized by a better flight performance, having larger forewings, a higher body mass, and a higher fat content. Thus, successful males were larger and in better condition than unsuccessful ones. Strikingly, many differences found indicated an enhanced flight performance for the former, which we suggest ultimately plays the key role for male mating success in B. anynana. As fat is the main energy source for flying insects, being crucial to flight endurance and in turn presumably to male mating success, it may represent a key determinant at the proximate level.","[Kehl, Tobias; Bensch, Julia; Boehm, Friederike; Kniepkamp, Bjoern Ole; Leonhardt, Vivien; Schwieger, Sarah; Fischer, Klaus] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Zool Inst & Museum, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany","Kehl, T (corresponding author), Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Zool Inst & Museum, Johann Sebastian Bach Str 11-12, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.",tobias.kehl@uni-greifswald.de,"Schwieger, Sarah/W-4676-2019","Schwieger, Sarah/0000-0002-6206-7150","German Research Council (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Fi 846/5-1]; 'Landesgraduiertenforderung' of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany","We thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful and constructive criticism.

The main objective of this study was to examine changes in several blood physiological parameters in a demersal shark, the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula), in the wild in relation to season, sex and maturity stage. For this purpose, 108 individuals at different deKelopmental stages were captured and released alive in the western Mediterranean. Blood was obtained from caudal vessels and plasma lipid fractions (total cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids) and a ketone body (3-beta-hydroxybutyrate) were measured. During summer, plasma triglyceride and phospholipid levels were lower in adults than in juveniles (mainly in females, probably related to breeding season and laying eggs). Plasma cholesterol levels also showed higher values in summer, indicating higher physical activities during summer and revealing that lipid fractions are more related to reproduction than to nutrition. Plasma 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate variations showed a different pattern. No differences were found between sex or maturity stage during summer, although the highest values in adult and juvenile males during winter indicates higher physical activity of males. This study, uses an innovative methodology to establish a correlation between lipid fractions and ketone bodies from the blood of wild individuals and changes in sexual and nutritional status. This method was conducted without damage to the target species and provides new information on the physiology of this abundant elasmobranch in the Mediterranean Sea. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Despite extensive effort testing for genetic benefits, there now seems to be a consensus that the so-called good genes' effects are at most weak. In parallel the search for direct benefits has mostly focused on the period surrounding egg laying, thus neglecting potential correlates of EPC that might be expressed at later stages in the breeding cycle. Here we used Bayesian methods to analyse data collected over four years in a population of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus, where no support was previously found for good genes' effects. We found that broods with mixed paternity experienced less brood failure at the nestling stage than broods with single paternity, and that females having experienced complete brood failure in their previous breeding attempt had higher rates of mixed paternity than either yearling or previously successful females. To better understand these observations we also explored relationships between extra-pair mating, male and female phenotype, and local breeding density. We found that in almost all cases the sires of extra-pair offspring were close neighbours, and that within those close neighbourhoods extra-pair sires were older than other males not siring extra-pair offspring. Also, females did not display consistent EPC status across years. Taken together our results suggest that multiple mating might be a flexible female behaviour influenced by previous breeding experience, and motivate further experimental tests of causal links between extra-pair copulation and predation.","[Mennerat, Adele; Jorgensen, Christian; Eliassen, Sigrunn] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol Sci, Bergen, Norway; [Mennerat, Adele] UPJV, CNRS, UMR 7058, Ecol & Dynam Syst Anthropises, Amiens, France; [Charmantier, Anne] Campus CNRS, UMR 5175, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, Montpellier, France; [Charmantier, Anne] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Mennerat, A (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Biol Sci, Bergen, Norway.",adele.mennerat@uib.no,"Jorgensen, Christian/B-4453-2009; Mennerat, Adele/K-4133-2019","Mennerat, Adele/0000-0003-0368-7197; Jorgensen, Christian/0000-0001-7087-4625",European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [ERC-2013-StG-337365-SHE]; OSU OREME; Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway [222021/F20],"AC was funded by the European Research Council (Starting grant ERC-2013-StG-337365-SHE to AC) and the OSU OREME.

There are many biological, environmental and procedural factors that potentially cause seed losses. The present understanding of these factors is highly limited, based on disparate lines of evidence and constrained by the challenges associated with quantifying the fate of minute organisms in the field. Addressing these knowledge gaps is a prerequisite for meeting the growing global demand for farmed seafood and requires significant and coherent research. We identify the diverse range of potential drivers of seed loss in mussel aquaculture and review existing knowledge around these factors to identify critical knowledge gaps and research priorities. Losses appear to be caused by a complex suite of interacting factors that include stress during transfer between regions, underlying variations in seed condition, change in the farm environment, predation, competition from biofouling organisms and migratory behaviour of seed mussels. Solutions to the losses of mussel seed in commercial culture are mostly likely to be achieved through research directed at evaluating a range of practical interventions during the critical phase of nursery culture of mussel seed.","[South, Paul M.; Delorme, Natali J.; Floerl, Oliver] Cawthron Inst, Private Bag 2, Nelson 7042, New Zealand; [South, Paul M.; Jeffs, Andrew G.] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Skelton, Bradley M.] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand","South, PM (corresponding author), Cawthron Inst, Private Bag 2, Nelson 7042, New Zealand.",paul.south@cawthron.org.nz,,"South, Paul/0000-0003-1096-8990","New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and EmploymentNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) [CAWX1315, CAWX1801]","New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Grant/Award Number: CAWX1315 and CAWX1801",,185,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1753-5123,1753-5131,,REV AQUACULT,Rev.

Activity level, movement rate, home-range size, number of same-sex neighbors, and number of agonistic interactions decreased as the mating season finished for males but not for females. The number of females' home ranges overlapped by the home range of each male was also higher in the mating season than in the nonmating season. Measurements of available ambient temperatures showed that the thermal environment was suitable for the activity of lizards in both seasons, therefore the seasonal changes cannot be explained by thermal constraints. Males gain access to several females by increasing their home-range size, thus overlapping a larger number of females' home ranges, but as a consequence, also those of a larger number of male competitors. Thus, the cost of incurring agonistic interactions also increases. These results suggest that because activity and aggressiveness in males are related to their mating success, the balance between the costs and benefits of their activity and spatial strategies differs seasonally, and this may be the cause of the observed seasonal changes.","CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Martin, J (corresponding author), CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, E-28006 Madrid, Spain.",,"Martin, Jose/B-1073-2014; Aragon, Pedro/B-2598-2009; Lopez, Pilar/K-6221-2014","Martin, Jose/0000-0001-6648-3998; Aragon, Pedro/0000-0002-6849-7274; Lopez, Pilar/0000-0001-6577-1509",,,,39,31,33,0,15,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,OTTAWA,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1A 0R6, CANADA",0008-4301,,,CAN J ZOOL,Can.

Such 'supply-side' effects have been relatively poorly studied in soft-sediment habitats because of the difficulty of sampling very small infaunal recruits. I investigated whether spatial patterns of infaunal recruitment along an estuarine gradient could account for the observed cline in adult diversity. On 9 occasions spread over 13 mo, cores of sterile sediment from 2 different sources were embedded in beaches along the estuarine axis of Puget Sound, Washington, and sampled 6 wk later for new recruits. Identities and abundances of recruits (mostly polychaetes and bivalves) varied among seasons, but differed little between sediments from different sources. Contrary to expectations, neither recruit richness nor abundance was lower at the southern (more estuarine) end of the gradient, where adult taxonomic diversity is low. For a number of taxa and time periods, recruitment was actually stronger at the southern beaches. Multivariate differences between assemblages of recruits and adults were much greater at the southern sites, indicating that post-recruitment processes at these sites modify diversity and abundance patterns initially established by recruitment. These processes could include predation on juveniles, adult-juvenile competition, or physiologically stressful abiotic conditions.","[Dethier, Megan N.] Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Labs, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA; [Dethier, Megan N.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA","Dethier, MN (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Labs, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA.",mdethier@u.washington.edu,,"Dethier, Megan/0000-0001-8900-0522",National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [R/ES-57],"This project received indispensable help from H.

Understanding and consideration of such environmental conditions is required in ecological risk assessment of toxicants, but it remains basically limited. In the present study, we aimed to determine how and to what extent alterations in the abiotic and biotic environmental conditions can alter the sensitivity of a community to an insecticide, as well as its recovery after contamination. We conducted an outdoor microcosm experiment in which zooplankton communities were exposed to the insecticide esfenvalerate (0.03, 0.3, and 3 mu g/L) under different regimes of solar radiation and community density, which represented different levels of food availability and competition. We focused on the sensitivity of the entire community and analysed it using multivariate statistical methods, such as principal response curves and redundancy analysis. The results showed that community sensitivity varied markedly between the treatments. In the experimental series with the lowest availability of food and strongest competition significant effects of the insecticide were found at the concentration of 0.03 mu g/L In contrast, in the series with relatively higher food availability and weak competition such effects were detected at 3 mu g/L only. However, we did not find significant differences in the community recovery rates between the experimental treatments. These findings indicate that environmental context is more important for ecotoxicological evaluation than assumed previously. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Many species of turtles, including the Diamond-backed Terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin), exhibit sexual dimorphism in body size, possibly enabling the sexes to exploit different resources and reduce intraspecific competition. Female terrapins not only have larger body sizes but also disproportionately larger skulls and jaws relative to males. To better understand the relationship between skull morphology and terrapin feeding ecology, we measured the in-lever to out-lever ratios of 27 male and 33 female terrapin jaws to evaluate biomechanics of the trophic apparatus. In addition, we measured prey handling times by feeding Fiddler Crabs (Uca pugnax), a natural prey item, to 24 terrapins in the laboratory. Our results indicate that although females have disproportionately larger heads, they have similar in: out lever ratios to males, suggesting that differences in adductor muscle mass are more important in determining bite force than jaw in: out lever ratios.

I tested the hypothesis that successional changes in vegetation structure, which affected invertebrate abundance, would influence growth rates and body condition in the early-successional, insectivorous gecko Nephrurus stellatus. I captured geckos at 17 woodland sites spanning a succession gradient from 2 to 48 years post-fire. Body condition and growth rates were analysed as a function of the best-fitting fire-related predictor (invertebrate abundance or time since fire) with different combinations of the co-variates age, sex and location. Body condition in the whole population was positively affected by increasing invertebrate abundance and, in the adult population, this effect was most pronounced for females. There was strong support for a decline in growth rates in weight with time since fire. The results suggest that increased early-successional invertebrate abundance has filtered through to a higher trophic level with physiological benefits for insectivorous geckos. I integrated the new findings about trophic interactions into a general conceptual model of mechanisms underlying post-fire population dynamics based on a long-term research programme. The model highlights how greater food availability during early succession could drive rapid population growth by contributing to previously reported enhanced reproduction and dispersal. This study provides a framework to understand links between ecological and physiological traits underlying post-fire population dynamics.","[Smith, Annabel L.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland","Smith, AL (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland.",annabel@smithecology.org,"Smith, Annabel L./M-6391-2014","Smith, Annabel L./0000-0002-1201-8713",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP0776604]; Native Vegetation Council of South Australia; DEWNR; Wildlife Conservation Fund; Sir Mark Mitchell Research Foundation; Lirabenda Endowment Fund; Ecological Society of Australia; Australian National UniversityAustralian National University,"This paper is dedicated to the memory of Professor C.

Subsequent recruitment was surveyed two years later. Of the 5487 seeds, 97% were trapped 120 m from the nearest adult tree. Seasonal dispersal curves were consistently right-skewed and leptokurtic. The inverse power law and the negative exponential model accounted for a similar fraction of the variation in the number of dispersed seeds at different distances (79-86% and 76-88%, respectively). Seed dispersal rates varied significantly among seasons. Eighty saplings (3-5 yr old) became established during the three years of the study, most within 15 m of the nearest canopy, some farther away, and none directly under the tree canopies. The estimated probability of seed survival to sapling stage increased significantly with increasing distance from adults, as predicted by the escape hypothesis. Winds varied significantly between seasons. generating significant interseasonal variation in seed deposition patterns far from, but not near to, adult trees. Coefficients of variation of seed dispersal rates were lower near adult trees than farther away. Both Moran's I correlograms and partial Mantel tests revealed interseasonal consistency in seed deposition patterns for the total study area and for the area near adult trees but showed considerable variation farther away. We suggest that the low spatiotemporal variation near adults and the high variation far away act to intensify the effects of predation (by increasing the efficiency of predators near adults and reducing it far away) and competition (by increasing the intensity of seedling competition near adults and reducing it far away) in structuring the observed survivorship curve predicted by the escape hypothesis.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Alexander Silberman Inst Life Sci, Dept Evolut Systemat & Ecol, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; Agr Res Org, Dept Field Crops & Nat Resources, Volcani Ctr, IL-50250 Bet Dagan, Israel","Nathan, R (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,"Nathan, Ran/A-9380-2008",,,,,63,129,161,0,36,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,WASHINGTON,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",0012-9658,,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,AUG,2000,81,8,,,,,2156,2169,,10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[2156:SVISDA]2.0.CO;2,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,346UF,WOS:000088888900010,,,,,2021-09-27,

Nest numbers and productivity were highest, and hatching was earliest, when spring conditions were warmest. Comparing Bluff with five other colonies in the Bering and Chukchi Seas with long-term data sets, breeding began relatively early along the Alaskan coast compared with the Pribilof Islands (St. Paul and SL George), and progressively much earlier relative to sea ice retreat at more northern coastal colonies. Average annual productivity was significantly higher at Bluff and Cape Lisburne than at Cape Peirce, owing perhaps to higher intraspecific competition for food or higher predation on eggs and chicks at Cape Peirce. Breeding chronology was positively correlated at Bluff and Cape Peirce, and productivity was positively correlated between Bluff and both capes Peirce and Lisburne; these colonies are in the flow field of Alaskan Coastal Water. Both breeding chronology and productivity on St. Paul Island in the Middle Shelf Domain were strongly and independently correlated with timing and productivity not only at nearby St. George Island but also at Bluff, possibly reflecting stronger couplings to continental-shelf food webs on St. Paul than St. George. Both breeding chronology and productivity were significantly correlated between Cape Peirce and both St. Paul and SL George islands, suggesting commonalities across water masses that have very different patterns and processes of seasonal food web development. Productivity on St. George Island was highest in years when winter sea ice concentration was highest. in apparent contrast to Bluff: however, productivity at both St. George and Bluff was higher in years of earlier ice retreat. Positive correlations in both timing and productivity among colonies in disparate oceanic regimes could be due to similarities in pre-breeding condition of adults if they winter or stage in early spring in the same or similar areas.","[Murphy, Edward C.] Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Roseneau, David G.; Byrd, G.

Earlier publications report various numbers of released animals and that all founders originated from West Africa. We revise these assumptions through consultation of archived FZS records and genetic analyses of surviving descendants. Accordingly, 17 chimpanzees were transported to Africa in four waves, with male-female ratios of 3:8, 1:0, 1:0 and 2:2; one female died in transit. Thus, 16 chimpanzees were released in total. FZS and studbook records allocate a West African provenance to only 19% of the founders and a generic Africa origin to 56%. Still, studbook records render it unlikely that any of the founders were captive-born. In addition, our genetic analyses based on biological samples from the current descendants trace the geographical origin of their ancestors back to West Africa (P. t. verus) and Central Africa (P. t. troglodytes). Based on counts of individuals and night nests, we estimate that the population, since 1969, grew to around 35 individuals in 2014 (annual increase 3.3%). Thus, chimpanzees released onto a large forested island free from predators or hunting pressure, habitat destruction and conspecific competition can form a self-sustaining island population without human support.","[Msindai, Josephine N.; Sommer, Volker] Univ Coll London UCL, Dept Anthropol, London, England; [Roos, Christian] Leibniz Inst Primate Res, German Primate Ctr DPZ, Gene Bank Primates & Primate Genet Lab, Gottingen, Germany; [Schurmann, Felix] Forschungszentrum Gotha Univ Erfurt FZG), Gotha, Germany","Msindai, JN (corresponding author), Univ Coll London UCL, Dept Anthropol, London, England.",njmsindai@hotmail.co.uk,,"Msindai, Josephine/0000-0002-6952-9522",Honeyguide Foundation; Asilia Africa,"The Tanzanian Wildlife Research Institute, the Tanzanian Commission for Science and Technology and the Tanzania National Parks Authority kindly enabled JNM to conduct research on Rubondo.

We focused on low- to mid-order tributaries flowing into the river and spanning similar to 11 degrees of latitude. Physical-habitat characteristics and water chemistry were examined as factors affecting diversity both at the local and regional scale. No overall latitudinal trend was found in richness, but trends were apparent at the order level. Local generic richness of Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera declined toward the north, Trichoptera generic richness was lowest in the middle of the latitudinal range, and Diptera generic richness increased with latitude. Most orders of aquatic insects followed the expected decline in richness with increasing latitude, but the family Chironomidae was an exception, probably because of their ability to tolerate subarctic environmental conditions and because of the relative absence of potential predation and competition from other invertebrates. Streams were characterized along principal component axes corresponding to stream size and terrain, substrate, water source, and turbidity. Most groups were slightly more diverse in larger streams. Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera had higher richness on coarse substrates, and Trichoptera had lower richness in streams in the Norman Range that possessed unique hydrology and water-chemistry characteristics because of the presence of taliks. Chironomid richness was positively correlated with latitude and stream size. Latitudinal gradients in regional diversity largely followed the trends in local richness, but all taxa had small regional numbers of genera near the middle of the latitudinal range, and a decline in overall aquatic insect richness between the south and north was more apparent at the regional scale. We conclude that regional environmental factors control the maximum richness that can be expected in a locality at a given latitude, whereas local environmental factors control the number of taxa present at a site. Spatial gradients in benthic insect richness are likely to affect the applicability of biomonitoring metrics that use groups whose richness varies with latitude.","[Scott, Ryan W.; Barton, David R.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Evans, Marlene S.; Keating, Jonathan J.] Environm Canada, Aquat Ecosyst Protect Res Div, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada","Barton, DR (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",rwscott@scimail.uwaterloo.ca; drbarton@scimail.uwaterloo.ca; marlene.evans@ec.gc.ca; jonathan.keating@ec.gc.ca,,,Environment CanadaCGIAR; Indian and Northern Affairs Canada,"This study was funded by Environment Canada and a travel grant from Indian and Northern Affairs Canada through the Northern Student Training Program.

Mice mobilize and cache acorns to store them for winter consumption. They carry acorns away from potential competitors, face predation risks during mobilization, and cache acorns in areas where pilfering risks are low. However, mice can act either as net predators or as moderately efficient dispersers, depending on the way landscape management affects intraspecific competition for acorns and shelter availability. To assess the influence of landscape structure and mouse behavior on acorn dispersal, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) that translates forest management into changes in key environmental factors driving mouse foraging decisions. The model was able to predict accurately acorn dispersal patterns in a wide range of forest management practices based on information on forest habitat availability, stem density and shrub cover. Sensitivity analysis revealed that caching rates emerged from the interplay between intraspecific competition for seeds and predation risk accepted during mobilization. It also showed that intraspecific competition for acorns decreased with increasing habitat loss (due to positive edge effects on acorn production) while landscape resistance to mouse movements increased. As a result, the net benefits of caching declined and acorn predation became the dominant strategy. Finally, we assessed the effects of shrub encroachment as a management practice to enhance dispersal services in savanna-like landscapes (dehesas). The model predicted non-linear responses with a 65% threshold of shrub cover needed to achieve relatively high levels of acorn dispersal. This value may not be compatible with the traditional exploitation of dehesas (livestock rearing). Our study shows that integrated approaches that combine environmental change driven by management with behavioral responses of dispersers improve our understanding of the causes of recruitment bottlenecks, and are useful tools for evaluating conservation strategies aimed at enhancing dispersal services.","[Moran-Lopez, Teresa; Valladares, Fernando; Diaz, Mario] CSIC, Dept Biogeog & Global Change BCG MNCN, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, ES-28006 Madrid, Spain; [Wiegand, Thorsten] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modeling, DE-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Manuel Morales, Juan] Univ Nacl Comahue, Lab Ecotono, INIBIOMA CONICET, Black River, Argentina","Moran-Lopez, T (corresponding author), CSIC, Dept Biogeog & Global Change BCG MNCN, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, ES-28006 Madrid, Spain.",tmoranlopez@gmail.com,"Diaz, Mario/C-3052-2017; Wiegand, Thorsten/H-5877-2016; Lopez, Teresa Moran/ABI-2142-2020; Morales, Juan Manuel/B-6316-2009","Diaz, Mario/0000-0002-6384-6674; Wiegand, Thorsten/0000-0002-3721-2248; Lopez, Teresa Moran/0000-0002-5804-5258; Morales, Juan Manuel/0000-0001-7269-7490","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2010-22180-C03-03, CGL2009-08430, EEBB-I-13-06123, EEBB-I-14-08506]; Comunidad de MadridComunidad de Madrid [CM S2009 AMB 1783]; ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [233066]; FPI grant [BES-2011-048346]","We acknowledge D.

Travel time, cost of transporting food back to the central place, and exposure to predators should all act to increase foraging costs with increasing distance from the refuge. We examined habitat and patch use in rock hyraxes (Procavia capensis) inhabiting a group of kopjes in a semiarid savanna, Augrabies Falls National Park, South Africa. We tested the prediction of more intense patch use closer to the central place by measuring giving-up densities (GUDs) in experimental resource patches set at four different distances from the kopje and in two microhabitats differing in cover. Surprisingly, hyraxes had their lowest GUDs at intermediate distances from the kopje.

Trilobites allow the study of repaired damage over long time periods and large geographic areas due to their longevity as a group, global distribution, and well-preserved mineralized exoskeletons. Repair frequencies on trilobites from three sites representing offshore marine environments in the Iberian Chains ( Spain) show no injuries on 45 complete redlichiid thoraces from Minas Tierga (Huermeda Formation, Cambrian Series 2, Stage 4), or 23 complete Eccaparadoxides pradoanus thoraces from Mesones de Isuela (Murero Formation, Cambrian Series 3, Drumian). Ten injuries on 69 E. pradoanus thoraces from Purujosa (Murero Formation, Cambrian Series 3, Drumian) were noted. There is no evidence for laterally asymmetric predation or size selection on the trilobites in this study. Weak evidence for selection for the rear of the thorax is documented. A series of injured trilobites illustrates four stages of the healing process. Analysis of injury locations and frequency suggests that injuries to these trilobites are predatory in origin. Semilandmark analysis of previously described exoskeletons with unrepaired damage assigned to the ichnotaxon Bicrescomanducator serratus alongside newly collected damaged exoskeletons from Purujosa (Mansilla and Murero Formations, Stage 5, Drumian), Mesones de Isuela (Murero Formation, Drumian), and Minas Tierga (Huermeda Formation, Stage 4) found that shapes of biotic and abiotic breaks could not be distinguished.","[Pates, Stephen] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Pates, Stephen; Daley, Allison C.] Univ Lausanne, Inst Earth Sci, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Bicknell, Russell D.

Location: North of Navarre (Spain). Methods: Bird censuses were taken at breeding and wintering periods in study plots during 2001, 2002 and 2003. Nest boxes were placed in half of the study plots, and plots with and without nest boxes were compared for variation in nesting guild abundance and richness. Results: Results showed an increase in cavity-nesting bird abundance and species richness between two breeding periods and in abundance between two non-breeding periods in the plots where nest boxes were added in both types of forest. No difference in abundance or richness during breeding was observed for the non-cavity nesting birds in plots where there was an increase in the abundance of cavity-nesters. However, an increase in abundance of non-cavity nesters in non-breeding periods was observed in plots where nest boxes were added in pine forests. Conclusion: Results suggest that cavity-nesting bird communities were limited by the availability of suitable natural holes in the two forest types studied and highlight the importance of cavities outside the breeding season as shelter or roosting places for both cavity and non-cavity nesting bird communities.","[Sanchez, Sara; Javier Cuervo, Jose; Moreno, Eulalia] CSIC, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, E-04001 Almeria, Spain","Sanchez, S (corresponding author), CSIC, Estac Expt Zonas Aridas, Gen Segura 1, E-04001 Almeria, Spain.",sara.schez@gmail.com,"Cuervo, Jose Javier/K-1646-2014; Moreno, Eulalia/D-4230-2014","Cuervo, Jose Javier/0000-0001-7943-7835; Moreno, Eulalia/0000-0002-7197-5679",,,,55,17,19,0,11,SOC ESPANOLA ORNITOLGIA,MADRID,"MELQUIADAS BIENCINTO 34, E-28053 MADRID, SPAIN",0570-7358,2341-0825,,ARDEOLA,Ardeola,DEC,2007,54,2,,,,,261,274,,,,,14,Ornithology,Zoology,285UX,WOS:000254802800008,,,,,2021-09-27,

However, an individual's position depends not only on its own behaviour, but also on the behaviour of others. Theoretical models of collective motion suggest that global patterns of spatial assortment can arise from individual variation in local interaction rules. However, this prediction remains untested. Using high-resolution GPS tracking of members of a wild baboon troop, we identify consistent inter-individual differences in within-group spatial positioning. We then apply an algorithm that identifies what number of conspecific group members best predicts the future location of each individual (we call this the individual's neighbourhood size) while the troop is moving. We find clear variation in the most predictive neighbourhood size, and this variation relates to individuals' propensity to be found near the centre of their group. Using simulations, we show that having different neighbourhood sizes is a simple candidate mechanism capable of linking variation in local individual interaction rules-in this case how many conspecifics an individual interacts with-to global patterns of spatial organization, consistent with the patterns we observe in wild primates and a range of other organisms.","[Farine, D.

Competitive interactions between fish and jellyfish have been depicted as a major mechanism controlling this variability. Biological associations involving jellyfish are, however, more diverse than predation-prey interactions and remain poorly understood. Parasitic associations in particular may have relevant effects on jellyfish host populations. We studied basic patterns (temporal patterns of parasite intensity-biomass and the distribution pattern of parasites among hosts) of the association between the parasitic anemone Peachia chilensis and its scyphozoan host, Chrysaora plocamia. The mean number of parasites per host (MI) was high (average = 465) and showed significant differences during the pelagic life phase of the medusa. The mean biomass of parasites per host was also significantly different among months but showed a different temporal pattern to that of MI, which may reflect recruitment pulses of parasitic larvae. The mean biomass of P. chilensis per host averaged 56.3 mg ash-free dry mass, which represents a trophic flow of energy probably linking pelagic and benthic food webs. The distribution of parasites among hosts was best fitted to the negative binomial distribution model, as typical for host-parasite systems. We concluded that the parasite-induced host mortality and reduction of fecundity, represented by parasitic castration, is restricted to a few hosts and is therefore under the expected levels that characterize the dynamic equilibrium of host-parasite systems.","[Riascos, Jose M.; Villegas, Viviana; Caceres, Ignacio; Pacheco, Aldo S.] Univ Antofagasta, Inst Invest Oceanol, Climate Change Ecol Res Grp, CENSOR Lab, Antofagasta, Chile; [Gonzalez, Jorge E.] Univ Antofagasta, Programa Doctorado Ciencias Aplicadas, Antofagasta, Chile","Riascos, JM (corresponding author), Univ Antofagasta, Inst Invest Oceanol, Climate Change Ecol Res Grp, CENSOR Lab, Ave Univ Antofagasta 02800, Antofagasta, Chile.",josemar.rv@gmail.com,"Riascos, Jose M./J-5816-2013; Pacheco, Aldo S/L-9939-2017","Pacheco, Aldo S/0000-0002-2767-6436; Riascos, Jose/0000-0001-8631-8877",National Fund for Scientific & Technological Development (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11100256]; FONDECYTComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [3100085],"We thank M.

Inadequate livestock management, including keeping sheep numbers above carrying capacity, has led to a degradation of the Patagonian steppe. Recently, interest has grown towards a reduction in sheep density and diversification of extractive activities. Guanaco populations could be potentially amenable to a number of sustainable uses. Our aim was to investigate the factors that determine guanaco distribution in southern Argentine Patagonia and to generate a predictive cartography at the regional scale. We hypothesized that guanaco distribution could be determined by primary productivity, terrain ruggedness, human disturbance and poaching, and competition with livestock. Guanaco surveys were performed from vehicles using a road survey method. To analyze the relationship between guanaco occurrence and potential predictors we built Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) using a binomial error and a logistic link. We found that guanaco occurrence increased in the less productive and remote areas, far from cities and oil camps, and decreased in regions with high sheep density. These results suggest that guanacos tend to occur where human pressure is lower. One way to promote guanaco conservation would be to highlight the economic value of guanacos under the regulations imposed by a sustainable exploitation of their populations. The predictive models developed here could be a useful tool for the implementation of conservation and management programs at the regional scale.","[Pedrana, Julieta; Travaini, Alejandro] Univ Nacl Patagonia Austral, Ctr Invest Puerto Deseado, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, RA-9050 Puerto Deseado, Santa Cruz, Argentina; [Bustamante, Javier] CSIC, Estac Biol Donana, Dept Wetland Ecol, Seville 41092, Spain; [Rodriguez, Alejandro] CSIC, Estac Biol Donana, Dept Conservat Biol, Seville 41092, Spain","Pedrana, J (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Patagonia Austral, Ctr Invest Puerto Deseado, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, POB 238,Avenida Prefectura Naval S-N, RA-9050 Puerto Deseado, Santa Cruz, Argentina.",jpedrana@yahoo.com.ar,"Bustamante, Javier/AAA-7273-2019; Bustamante, Javier/C-2735-2008; Rodriguez, Alejandro/E-7709-2011","Bustamante, Javier/0000-0001-7515-0677; Bustamante, Javier/0000-0001-7515-0677; Rodriguez, Alejandro/0000-0001-9367-3420; Travaini, Alejandro/0000-0002-2694-6617",BBVA FoundationBBVA Foundation; CONICET (Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"This work was primarily funded by the BBVA Foundation through a grant under the Conservation Biology Programme.

The mirrors allowed us to visually simulate increased density, without the tadpoles' behavior being confounded by chemical cues from additional tadpoles. In the first experiment, we demonstrated that Xenopus tadpoles have a right eye preference for mirrors, contrary to the left eye preference of all other anuran species studied to date. This lateralized eye use disappeared, however, as tadpoles approached metamorphosis. Next, we examined how mirrored aquaria walls affected tadpole growth and development. We found that tadpoles raised in aquaria with partially mirrored walls showed depressed growth compared to tadpoles raised without mirrors, despite the fact that Xenopus larvae normally thrive when raised in visual contact with conspecifics. The tadpoles raised with mirrors had, though not significantly, proportionally larger bodies relative to their tail length (d=0.51). This suggests that a phenotypically plastic response in body proportions was induced in these tadpoles solely by the sight of other tadpoles. The third experiment established that X. laevis tadpoles are more active in front of a mirror; i.e., they turn more often and spend more time in front of mirrored surfaces. We consider this increased activity to be an aberrant behavior of the tadpoles, which were attempting to school with their own images. We suggest that this extra activity reduced the amount of energy available for growth, accounting for the depressed growth seen in our second experiment.","[Gouchie, G. M.; Roberts, L.

Adult body mass varies by more than 10-fold, and body length (snout-vent length, SVL) varies by approximate to 2.2-fold. Predation and interspecific food competition are largely absent and can be excluded as potential forces explaining differences in body size among populations. This provides an ideal system in which to determine how proximate environmental factors affect adult body size, We compared the small iguanas from Genovesa Island (mean adult male SVL 250 mm) to the larger Santa Fe iguanas (mean adult male SVL 400 mm). Marine iguanas forage on intertidal algae pastures in scramble competition. Energy availability was lower on Genovesa than on Santa Fe, because of lower marine productivity on Genovesa. The length of grazable algal turf decreased with increasing sea surface temperature (SST). SST was approximate to 2 degrees C lower on Santa Fe than on Genovesa, implying approximate to 1.5 mm lower algae pastures on the latter. Genovesa showed a fivefold lower standing algal biomass and a twofold lower productivity of algae pastures than did Santa Fe. The smallest iguanas of each island had approximate to 1.5-fold higher bite rates during foraging, and their absolute food intake per day was 35% that of the largest iguanas. However, food intake per bite per gram of body mass was about twice as high for small iguanas as for large iguanas. Large iguanas of both islands showed a marked decline in body mass during the two study years, whereas small iguanas (SVL < 170 mm on Genovesa and < 320 mm on Santa Fe) increased in mass, Growth rates of SVL reflected these findings. A comparison of measured metabolizable energy with published field metabolic rates (FMR) suggested that iguanas above a threshold size were in negative energy balance, because energy intake scaled to body mass with a lower exponent (0.3) than FMR (0.97). Threshold body size was lower on Genovesa than on Santa Fe and differed between years: In the lean El Nino year (1991/1992), iguanas > 200 mm SVL on Genovesa and > 310 mm SVL on Santa Fe significantly lost mass; in the more productive year (1992/1993), thresholds were 230 mm and 350 mm SVL, respectively. Thus, food abundance (length and turnover of algal swards) explained differences in adult body length and mass between islands as a result of energetic limitation. On a given island, foraging efficiency (intake/bite) explained the negative energy balance of large compared to small iguanas. This also explained why, on both islands, the largest animals suffered higher mortality rates than did medium-sized ones when food was scarce. The finding that small animals outcompeted larger ones because of their higher foraging efficiency resembles the grazing succession in ungulate herbivores.","UNIV BIELEFELD, DEPT ANIM BEHAV, D-33501 BIELEFELD, GERMANY; MAX PLANCK INST BEHAV PHYSIOL, D-82319 SEEWIESEN, GERMANY",,,,,,,,64,70,71,0,48,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,OCT,1997,78,7,,,,,2204,2217,,10.2307/2265956,,,14,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XZ789,WOS:A1997XZ78900023,,,,,2021-09-27,

Here we exposed wood-frog tadpoles (Lithobates sylvaticus) to a control diet and one that was soaked in chemical cues released from injured conspecifics, and documented growth and development of the tadpoles. If animals perceive repeated exposure to injured conspecific cues as indicating a high risk environment, then we predict that tadpoles would reduce foraging, prolonging time to metamorphosis, reducing growth rate and initiating adaptive changes in tail morphology. Conversely, if tadpoles interpret repeated exposure to these chemical cues as an indicator of competitor density, they should increase growth rate and body size to become better competitors. We found that tadpoles exposed to chemical cues exhibited significantly larger body width and body length relative to the control. These patterns are inconsistent with a response to risk but correspond with observed responses of wood-frog tadpoles to increased competition.","[Jefferson, Dale M.; Hobson, Keith A.; Chivers, Douglas P.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada; [Hobson, Keith A.] Environm Canada, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada","Jefferson, DM (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Biol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E2, Canada.",dala.jefferson@usask.ca,"Hobson, Keith/Q-9306-2019","Chivers, Douglas/0000-0002-9497-4329",University of Saskatchewan; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Environment Canada operating funds,"DMJ was supported by a Dean's Scholarship from the University of Saskatchewan.

These encounters are likely to occur with regularity inside surface-bound communities that microbes most often occupy in natural environments. Such communities, termed biofilms, are spatially constrained: interactions become limited to near neighbors, diffusion of solutes and particulates can be reduced, and there is pronounced heterogeneity in nutrient access and physiological state. It is appreciated from prior theoretical work that phage-bacteria interactions are fundamentally different in spatially structured contexts, as opposed to well-mixed liquid culture. Spatially structured communities are predicted to promote the protection of susceptible host cells from phage exposure, and thus weaken selection for phage resistance. The details and generality of this prediction in realistic biofilm environments, however, are not known. Here, we explore phage-host interactions using experiments and simulations that are tuned to represent the essential elements of biofilm communities. Our simulations show that in biofilms, phage-resistant cells-as their relative abundance increases-can protect clusters of susceptible cells from phage exposure, promoting the coexistence of susceptible and phage-resistant bacteria under a large array of conditions. We characterize the population dynamics underlying this coexistence, and we show that coexistence is recapitulated in an experimental model of biofilm growth measured with confocal microscopy. Our results provide a clear view into the dynamics of phage resistance in biofilms with single-cell resolution of the underlying cell-virion interactions, linking the predictions of canonical theory to realistic models and in vitro experiments of biofilm growth. IMPORTANCE In the natural environment, bacteria most often live in communities bound to one another by secreted adhesives. These communities, or biofilms, play a central role in biogeochemical cycling, microbiome functioning, wastewater treatment, and disease. Wherever there are bacteria, there are also viruses that attack them, called phages. Interactions between bacteria and phages are likely to occur ubiquitously in biofilms. We show here, using simulations and experiments, that biofilms will in most conditions allow phage-susceptible bacteria to be protected from phage exposure, if they are growing alongside other cells that are phage resistant. This result has implications for the fundamental ecology of phage-bacteria interactions, as well as the development of phage-based antimicrobial therapeutics.","[Simmons, Emilia L.; Bond, Matthew C.; Nadell, Carey D.] Dartmouth, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Koskella, Britt] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Drescher, Knut] Max Planck Inst Terr Microbiol, Marburg, Germany; [Drescher, Knut] Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Phys, Marburg, Germany; [Bucci, Vanni] Univ Massachusetts, Med Sch, Dept Microbiol & Physiol Syst, Worcester, MA 01605 USA","Nadell, CD (corresponding author), Dartmouth, Dept Biol Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.; Bucci, V (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Med Sch, Dept Microbiol & Physiol Syst, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.",vanni.bucci2@umassmed.edu; carey.d.nadell@dartmouth.edu,"; Drescher, Knut/N-6730-2015","Bond, Matthew/0000-0002-7188-9252; Drescher, Knut/0000-0002-7340-2444","GANN Fellowship from Dartmouth College; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [StG-716734]; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 987]; Behrens-Weise-Foundation; NSF ABI [1458347]; UMass President Science and Technology award; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB 1817342]; Burke Award from Dartmouth College; Cystic Fibrosis FoundationItalian Cystic Fibrosis Research Foundation [STANTO15RO]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P30-DK117469, 2R01AI081838, P20-GM113132]; Human Frontier Science FoundationHuman Frontier Science Program [RGY0077/2020]","M.C.B. was supported by a GANN Fellowship from Dartmouth College.

Previous studies focused on the role of leaching nutrients from mineral particles of Saharan (S) origin, and were restricted to single locations at given times of the year. In this study, we evaluate the effect of atmospheric particles from diverse sources and with a markedly different chemical composition [S dust and anthropogenic (A) aerosols] on marine planktonic communities from three locations of the northwestern Mediterranean with contrasted anthropogenic footprint. Experiments were also carried out at different times of the year, considering diverse initial conditions. We followed the dynamics of the heterotrophic community and a range of biogeochemical and physiological parameters in six experiments. While the effect of aerosols on bacterial abundance was overall low, bacterial heterotrophic production was up to 3.3 and 2.1 times higher in the samples amended with A and S aerosols, respectively, than in the controls. Extracellular enzymatic activities [leuaminopeptidase (AMA) and beta-glucosidase (beta-Gl)] were also enhanced with aerosols, especially from A origin. AMA and beta-Gl increased up to 7.1 in the samples amended with A aerosols, and up to 1.7 and 2.1 times, respectively, with S dust. The larger stimulation observed with A aerosols might be attributed to their higher content in nitrate. However, the response was variable depending the initial status of the seawater. In addition, we found that both A and S aerosols stimulated bacterial abundance and metabolism significantly more in the absence of competitors and predators.","[Marin, Isabel; Nunes, Sdena; Sanchez-Perez, Elvia D.; Txurruka, Estibalitz; Antequera, Carolina; Sala, Maria M.; Marrase, Celia; Peters, Francesc] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Barcelona, Spain","Marin, I (corresponding author), CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar, Barcelona, Spain.",isabel.marin.beltran@gmail.com,"Marrase, Celia/I-1166-2015; Peters, Francesc/A-6364-2009; Montserrat, Maria Montserrat/AAW-7487-2021; SALA, Maria Montserrat/O-4726-2014","Marrase, Celia/0000-0002-5097-4829; Peters, Francesc/0000-0001-9405-4306; Montserrat, Maria Montserrat/0000-0002-3804-5680; SALA, Maria Montserrat/0000-0002-3804-5680; Marin Beltran, Isabel/0000-0002-8389-0859; TXURRUKA ALBERDI, ESTIBALITZ/0000-0001-9512-9672","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad through the project ADEPT [CTM2011-23458]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad through the project DOREMI [CTM2012-342949]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad through the project ANIMA (MINECO/FEDER, EU) [CTM2015-65720-R]; FPI Spanish scholarship program [BES 2012-052976]; National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq) of BrazilConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) of MexicoConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)","This study was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad through the projects ADEPT (CTM2011-23458), DOREMI (CTM2012-342949), and ANIMA (CTM2015-65720-R, MINECO/FEDER, EU).

Theory suggests climate change is an increasingly stressful environment, predicting extinctions or decreased abundances. However, if favourable conditions align, such as an increase in resources or release from competition and predation, future climate can fuel population growth. Tests of such population growth models and the mechanisms by which they are enabled are rare. We tested whether intergenerational increases in population size might be facilitated by adjustments in reproductive success to favourable environmental conditions in a large-scale mesocosm experiment. Herbivorous amphipod populations responded to future climate by increasing 20 fold, suggesting that future climate might relax environmental constraints on fecundity. We then assessed whether future climate reduces variation in mating success, boosting population fecundity and size. The proportion of gravid females doubled, and variance in phenotypic variation of male secondary sexual characters (i.e. gnathopods) was significantly reduced. While future climate can enhance individual growth and survival, it may also reduce constraints on mechanisms of reproduction such that enhanced intra-generational productivity and reproductive success transfers to subsequent generations. Where both intra and intergenerational production is enhanced, population sizes might boom.","[Heldt, Katherine A.; Connell, Sean D.; Russell, Bayden D.; Munguia, Pablo] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Southern Seas Ecol Labs, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Anderson, Kathryn] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Russell, Bayden D.] Univ Hong Kong, Swire Inst Marine Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Russell, Bayden D.] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Munguia, P (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Southern Seas Ecol Labs, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",pablo.munguia@adelaide.edu.au,"Russell, Bayden D./A-9942-2008; Connell, Sean D/A-8874-2008; Russell, Bayden D./R-9325-2019","Russell, Bayden D./0000-0003-1282-9978; Connell, Sean D/0000-0002-5350-6852; Russell, Bayden D./0000-0003-1282-9978; Munguia, Pablo/0000-0002-9900-2123",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [FT0991953],"We thank the Marine Experiments for a Sustainable Outcome (MESO) team for assistance in monitoring and maintaining mesocosms, and the Munguia lab volunteers for their assistance with sorting specimen samples.

Studying the relationship between behavior and other fitness-related traits within the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) framework, which explains the integration of different traits using the concept of a fast-slow life-history continuum, may thus be a useful approach to understanding the evolution and maintenance of animal personality. According to the POLS hypothesis, for example, fast individuals should be behaviorally more active, bolder or less sociable, and potentially invest more in reproduction than slow individuals. Here, we examined whether the sociability of juvenile sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is linked with their key reproductive traits, carotenoid-based nuptial coloration of males and egg production of females. We also tested whether experimental manipulation of environmental conditions (control vs. warm winter) can change pace-of-life and the link between behavioral and reproductive traits. Male sticklebacks prone to shoaling expressed lower peak red coloration at the reproductive stage, during which they were solitary and territorial. In females, fecundity was not correlated with early social behavior. Experimental sticklebacks reared in warm winter conditions decreased their investment in reproduction, but the negative relationship between sociability and sexual signal of males was maintained. Our results suggest that the POLS could partly explain the maintenance of personality under predation pressure or severe mating competition. In natural environments, any benefit to sociable male sticklebacks may be counterbalanced by the cost of growing less attractive. Why do animals vary in personality, and how is such variation maintained within a population? An interesting approach for understanding this is studying how personality traits are correlated with other fitness-related traits within the pace-of-life framework. For the first time, our results show the link between sociability at the juvenile stage and the expression of sexual ornament during reproduction in male three-spined sticklebacks. Sociable juveniles may benefit from reduced predation risk, but they grow less attractive and this may reduce their mating success during reproduction. Thus, the trade-off between survival and reproduction may contribute to the maintenance of among-individual variation in behavior.","[Kim, Sin-Yeon; Velando, Alberto] Univ Vigo, Dept Ecoloxia & Bioloxia Anim, Vigo 36310, Spain","Kim, SY (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Dept Ecoloxia & Bioloxia Anim, Vigo 36310, Spain.",yeonkim@uvigo.es,"Kim, Sin-Yeon/K-2770-2014; Velando, Alberto/B-1701-2009","Velando, Alberto/0000-0001-8909-0724","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [CGL2012-40229-C02-02, CGL2014-60291-JIN]; Xunta de GaliciaXunta de GaliciaEuropean Commission [2012/305]",Funding was provided by the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (CGL2012-40229-C02-02 and CGL2014-60291-JIN) and the Xunta de Galicia (2012/305).,,45,4,4,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

However, the independent evolution of single traits cannot explain how observed phenotypic variations of these traits are maintained within populations. We studied genetic and phenotypic correlations between antipredator behaviors (shoaling and risk-taking) and morphology traits (pigmentation and size) in juvenile three-spined sticklebacks by using pedigree-based quantitative genetic analysis to test phenotypic integration (or complex phenotype) as an evolutionary response to predation risk. Individuals with strongly melanized (i.e., camouflaged) phenotype and genotype were less sociable to conspecifics, but bolder during foraging under predation risk. Individuals with faster growing phenotype and genotype were bolder, and those with lager eyes were more fearful. These phenotypic integrations were not confounded with correlated plastic responses to predation risk because the phenotypes were measured in naive fish born in the laboratory, but originated from a natural population with predation pressure. Consistent selection for particular combinations of traits under predation pressure or pleiotropic genes might influence the maintenance of the genetic (co)variations and polymorphism in melanin color, growth trajectory, and behavior patterns.","[Kim, Sin-Yeon; Velando, Alberto] Univ Vigo, Dept Ecoloxia Bioloxia Anim, Vigo 36310, Spain","Kim, SY (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Dept Ecoloxia Bioloxia Anim, Vigo 36310, Spain.",yeonkim@uvigo.es,"Velando, Alberto/B-1701-2009; Kim, Sin-Yeon/K-2770-2014","Velando, Alberto/0000-0001-8909-0724; ",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [CGL2012-40229-C02-02]; Xunta de GaliciaXunta de GaliciaEuropean Commission [2012/305]; Xunta de Galicia (Parga Pondal fellowship)Xunta de Galicia,"The authors are grateful to two anonymous referees for constructive comments.

In agricultural regions of the world, the effects of invasive fish on amphibians may coincide with pollution by agricultural fertilizers. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to examine the potential independent and interactive effects of introduced Western Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) and ammonium nitrate, an agricultural fertilizer, on Green Frog (Lithobates clamitans) tadpoles. Mosquitofish had a negative effect on the survivorship of Green Frog tadpoles. Green Frog tadpoles from mesocosms with mosquitofish were larger than tadpoles from mesocosms without mosquitofish, possibly due to a thinning effect that reduced intraspecific competition, as well as increased primary productivity. Ammonium nitrate additions did not affect survivorship in Green Frogs. However, Green Frog tadpoles in ammonium nitrate addition treatments were larger than those from treatments without ammonium nitrate addition, possibly due to increased phytoplankton abundance. In conclusion, mosquitofish and ammonium nitrate addition each had independent and additive effects on Green Frog tadpoles, but there was no evidence for significant interactions between these two stressors. Our results suggest that environmental stressors can have additive effects in some systems and that introduced fish predators may have greater impacts on amphibian populations than low level chemical contamination.","[Smith, Geoffrey R.; Dibble, Christopher J.; Terlecky, Andrew J.; Dayer, Christopher B.; Burner, Allison B.; Ogle, Megan E.] Denison Univ, Dept Biol, Granville, OH 43023 USA","Smith, GR (corresponding author), Denison Univ, Dept Biol, 100 South Rd, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",smithg@denison.edu,,,Denison University Research Foundation; Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute; Anderson Endowment of Denison University,"We thank M.

However, some slightly larger forms can also be omnivorous, i.e., forage upon both bacterial and eukaryotic resources. This hitherto largely ignored feeding mode may have pronounced implications for the interpretation of experiments about protistan bacterivory. We followed the response of an uncultured group of omnivorous cercozoan nanoflagellates from the Novel Clade 2 (Cerc_BAL02) to experimental food web manipulation in samples from the Gulf of Gdansk (Southern Baltic Sea). Seawater was either prefiltered through 5 mu m filters to exclude larger predators of nanoflagellates (F-treatment), or prefiltered and subsequently 1:10 diluted with sterile seawater (F+D-treatment) to stimulate the growth of both, flagellates and bacteria. Initially, Cerc_BAL02 were rapidly enriched under both conditions. They foraged on both, eukaryotic prey and bacteria, and were highly competitive at low concentrations of food. However, these omnivores were later only successful in the F+D treatment, where they eventually represented almost one fifth of all aplastidic nanoflagellates. By contrast, their numbers stagnated in the F-treatment, possibly due to top-down control by a concomitant bloom of other, unidentified flagellates.

Possible ability of the El Tor strains to adapt better than the classical strains to undefined environmental forces have been largely implicated for the change. Here we describe an environmental bacteriophage designated JSF9 which might have contributed to the range of factors. Methods: Competition assays were conducted in the infant mice model and in microcosms between representative El Tor and classical biotype strains in the absence or in the presence of JSF9 phage. Results: The JSF9 phage was found to kill classical strains and favour enrichment of El Tor strains, when mixtures containing strains of the two biotypes and JSF9 phage were subjected to alternate passage in infant mice and in samples of environmental water. Spontaneous derivatives of the classical biotype strains, as well as transposon mutants which developed resistance to JSF9 phage were found to be defective in colonization in the infant mouse model. Interpretation & conclusions: These results suggest that in addition to other factors, the inherent ability of El Tor biotype strains to evade predation by JSF9 or similar phages which kill classical biotype strains, might have enhanced the emergence of El Tor strains as the predominant pandemic biotype.","[Zahid, M.

Direct effects on macroinvertebrates are discussed in detail in a separate article. The present article presents the effects on other end points and discusses the hypothesized ecologic effect chain. Negative treatment effects on the zooplankton community were only recorded for the highest carbendazim treatment (NOECcommunity = 100 mu g/L). The rotifer Keratella tropica, cladocerans (Moina micrura, Ceriodaphnia cornuta, and Diaphanosoma sp.), and cyclopoid copepods were decreased or even eliminated at this treatment level. The decrease in zooplankton and macroinvertebrate abundances was accompanied by an increase in numbers of several tolerant invertebrates, presumably caused by a release from competition and predation. The death of sensitive invertebrates probably also led to an overall decreased grazing pressure because increased levels of chlorophyll-a and bloom of the floating macrophyte Wolffia sp. were noted. The increase in primary producers is discussed to be the probable cause of changes in physicochemical water conditions, eventually resulting in an anoxic water layer during the last 3 weeks of the experiment. This is likely to have resulted in decreased invertebrate abundances noted in that period. Furthermore, the decreased decomposition of Musa (banana) leaves observed 8 weeks after application is considered to be the indirect effect of a decreased microbial activity resulting from these anoxic water conditions, rather than a direct toxic effect of carbendazim.","[Daam, Michiel A.] Univ Tecn Lisboa, Inst Super Agron, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Daam, Michiel A.; Nogueira, Antonio J.

Nevertheless, complex developmental routes present parasites with a sequence of highly unlikely transmission events in order to complete their life cycles. Some trematodes like Coitocaecum parvum use facultative life cycle abbreviation to counter the odds of trophic transmission to the definitive host. Parasites adopting life cycle truncation possess the ability to reproduce within their intermediate host, using progenesis, without the need to reach the definitive host. Usually, both abbreviated and normal life cycles are observed in the same population of parasites. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that C. parvum can modulate its development in its amphipod intermediate host and adopt either the abbreviated or the normal life cycle depending on current transmission opportunities or the degree of intra-host competition among individual parasites. In the presence of cues from its predatory definitive host, the parasite is significantly less likely to adopt progenesis than in the absence of such cues. An intermediate response is obtained when the parasites are exposed to cues from non-host predators. The adoption of progenesis is less likely, however, when two parasites share the resource-limited intermediate host. These results show that parasites with complex developmental routes have transmission strategies and perception abilities that are more sophisticated than previously thought.","Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand","Lagrue, C (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",lagcl981@student.otago.ac.nz,"Poulin, Robert/C-3117-2008","Poulin, Robert/0000-0003-1390-1206; Lagrue, Clement/0000-0003-3347-6497",,,,32,52,52,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1010-061X,1420-9101,,J EVOLUTION BIOL,J.

The variation in density reflects a similar variety of processes ranging from density-dependent habitat selection at small scales to independently regulated populations at much larger ones. I measured each scale with experiments capitalizing on the behavior of individual deer mice foraging in badland habitats in Alberta, Canada. First, I used patterns in rodent density along transects crossing badland and prairie habitats to measure the scale of habitat selection. Consistent with theoretical predictions, differences in the intercepts of isodars (graphs of density in adjacent habitats assuming ideal habitat selection) comparing prairie and badland densities revealed a maximum scale of habitat selection on the order of only 140 m. Second, I used foraging experiments to estimate density-dependent declines in fitness measured by the surrogate of giving-up-density of mice foraging in artificial foraging patches. Habitat selection should tend to equalize giving-up-densities among replicated, but spatially segregated, grids containing different numbers of foragers. Contrary to predictions from habitat selection theory, giving-up-densities declined with increased forager density in the majority of grids. Giving-up densities in nine of 12 grids increased linearly as population density was reduced in 1997. Giving-up densities in eight of 10 grids increased linearly with resource supplements in 1998. The results of both experiments are consistent with independent resource harvest by varying numbers of foraging mice. The identity of outlier grids, that showed little response to either manipulation, varied between years. The combined results document spatially-structured populations and allow us to estimate the frequency of stochastic dynamics that may have a profound influence on evolution and conservation strategies in heterogeneous landscapes.","Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; Lakehead Univ, Fac Forestry & Forest Enviornm, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada","Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",,,,,,,61,15,16,0,5,FINNISH ZOOLOGICAL BOTANICAL PUBLISHING BOARD,UNIV HELSINKI,"P O BOX 26, FI-00014 UNIV HELSINKI, FINLAND",0003-455X,1797-2450,,ANN ZOOL FENN,Ann.

We investigated effects of enrichment (increasing carrying capacity, K, of the resource) on a system consisting of a resource (R), an intermediate consumer (N), and an omnivore (P) using a general mathematical model and tested the relevance of some of its predictions to a laboratory system of mixed bacteria (=R) and the ciliates Tetrahymena (=N) and Blepharisma (=P). The model produced six major predictions. First, N may facilitate or inhibit P. Enrichment may revert the net effect of N on P from facilitation to inhibition. Second, along a gradient of K, up to four regions of invasibility and stable coexistence of N and P may exist. At the lowest K, only R is present. At somewhat higher K, N can coexist with R. At intermediate it, either N and P coexist, or either consumer excludes the other clef ending on initial conditions. At the highest K, N may be excluded through apparent competition and only R and P can coexist. The pattern of persistence of Tetrahymena and Blepharisma along an enrichment gradient conformed fairly well to the scenario allowing coexistence at intermediate K. Third, fur stable equilibria of the omnivory system, R always increases and N always decreases with R. The abundances of bacteria and Tetrahymena were suggestive of such a pattern but did not allow a strict test because coexistence occurred at only one level of enrichment. Fourth, an omnivore can invade an R-N system at a lower K than an otherwise identical specialist predator of N. Fifth, an omnivore can always invade a food chain with such a specialist predator. Sixth, over ranges of K where both omnivory systems and otherwise identical three-level food chains are feasible, N is always less abundant in the omnivory system, whereas the relative abundances of R and P in omnivory systems compared to food chains may change with K. It is thus possible that total community biomass at a given It is lower in an omnivory system than in a food chain. Both the model and the experimental results caution that patterns of trophic-level abundances in response to enrichment predicted by food chain theory are not to be expected in systems with significant omnivory.","Univ Munich, Inst Zool, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Diehl, S (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Inst Zool, Karlstr 23-25, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",diehl@zi.biologie.uni-muenchen.de,"Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; ",,,,62,183,186,2,54,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

The survival rate of tadpoles before Gosner stage 30 varied widely and was not correlated with initial tadpole number.

This indirect interaction is further complicated because M. balthica facultatively switches between suspension- and deposit-feeding in response to the availability of suspended food particles. Laboratory experiments showed that the proportion of clams deposit feeding with exposed siphons increased with decreasing food concentrations in the water column and this resulted in shallower burial depths in the sediment. The clams showed similar responses in feeding mode and burial depth to the concentrations of suspended food indirectly manipulated by the presence and/or density of either interspecific (suspension-feeding soft-shelled clam Mya arenarin L.) or intraspecific competitors.","SMITHSONIAN ENVIRONM RES CTR,EDGEWATER,MD 21037",,,,,,,,55,64,64,0,19,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,1994,69,1,,,,,28,36,,10.2307/3545280,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MR887,WOS:A1994MR88700003,,,,,2021-09-27,

Nine percent of the millepores examined were colonized, there was a mean of 2.58 barnacles per colony and adult barnacles were contagiously distributed. A positive correlation between the abundance of millepore colonies on reefs and the frequency of colonies bearing barnacles indicated that barnacle larvae were attracted to settlement sites in proportion to the density of the host millepore colonies. From size-frequency distributions and regressions it was determined that barnacles grew at the rate of 1.1 mm per month and attained a length of about 19 mm in 18 months. Recruitment was low compared to densities of recruits of shore barnacles reported elsewhere. Seventy-four percent of annual recruits occurred upon the millepore colony length increment formed during the current year. It was concluded that settlement mortality was least near the growing edge of the host colony where the density of millepore predatory zooids was lowest. Mortality was higher during the second year than during the first year of growth and dead barnacles became overgrown by millepore skeleton and soft tissue. The low abundance of predators and the lack of inter- and intraspecific competition suggests that most adult mortality was due to age. In comparison to shore barnacles, the supply-side ecology of M. stultus was distinguished by lower recruitment, more rapid growth and settlement interaction with the host substratum, as well as a shorter adult life, lack of competition and escape from predators as adults.",,"LEWIS, JB (corresponding author), MCGILL UNIV, DEPT BIOL RM-N611, 1205 DR PENFIELD AVE, MONTREAL H3A 1B1, QUEBEC, CANADA.",,,,,,,33,14,14,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-0981,1879-1697,,J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,J.

Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin) recruitment varied across all temporal and spatial scales with the exception of among reefs within restricted zones of the Wando River Estuary. Both biological and physical factors could be related to the variability observed at different scales. At the finest spatial scales, oyster larvae indicate a preference for crevices and shells or tests of other organisms as attachment sites. Higher recruitment on the shaded sides of plates in the high intertidal zone was consistent with observations documenting the preference of larvae for shaded attachment sites, adverse effects of direct exposure to light and heat, and sedimentation. Observations made at broader spatial scales (100s m) suggested that the availability of potential settlement surfaces may be the underlying factor contributing to the observed distribution of intertidal oyster reefs. Recruitment patterns were affected by choice and position of substrata. Sampling frequency was observed to influence the number of peak recruitment events observed within a season, estimates of total net recruitment, and the variability associated with recruitment observations made at different levels in the intertidal zone. Gregarious settlement behavior, sedimentation, and biophysical modification of the substrata were implicated in the regulation of recruitment patterns at shorter time scales. Competition and predation appeared to be important in regulating recruitment patterns at longer time scales, although the effects varied across the intertidal gradient.

Despite the wide-spread use of amphibians as experimental model organisms, there is a limited understanding of how multiple abiotic and biotic factors affect the variation in metamorphic traits under natural conditions. The aim of our study was to quantify the effects of abiotic and biotic factors on spatial variation in the body size of tadpoles and size at metamorphosis of the European common toad (Bufo b. spinosus). Our study population was distributed over the riverbed (active tract) and the fringing riparian forest of a natural floodplain. The riverbed had warm ponds with variable hydroperiod and few predators, whereas the forest had ponds with the opposite characteristics. Spatial variation in body size at metamorphosis was governed by the interactive effects of abiotic and biotic factors. The particular form of the interaction between water temperature and intraspecific tadpole density suggests that abiotic factors laid the foundation for biotic factors: intraspecific density decreased growth only at high temperature. Predation and intraspecific density jointly reduced metamorphic size. Interspecific density had a negligible affect on body size at metamorphosis, suggesting weak inter-anuran interactions in the larval stage. Population density at metamorphosis was about one to two orders of magnitudes higher in the riverbed ponds than in the forest ponds, mainly because of lower tadpole mortality. Based on our results, we conclude that ponds in the riverbed appear to play a pivotal role for the population because tadpole growth and survival is best in this habitat.","[Indermaur, Lukas] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol EAWAG, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Indermaur, Lukas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Benedikt R.] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolut Biol & Umweltwissensch, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Benedikt R.] KARCH, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Tockner, Klement] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Tockner, Klement] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Schaub, Michael] Swiss Ornithol Inst, CH-6203 Sempach, Switzerland; [Schaub, Michael] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut Conservat Biol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Indermaur, L (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol EAWAG, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.",lukas.indermaur@eawag.ch,"Tockner, Klement/G-9265-2011; Schmidt, Benedikt R./B-8491-2008","Schmidt, Benedikt R./0000-0002-4023-1001; Tockner, Klement/0000-0002-0038-8151",MAVA Foundation (Switzerland),"We are grateful to Simone Blaser, Pascal Meuwly and Ursina von Planta for field data collection.

The main sources of this research are the materials of field research in the Altai in 1990-2016 with the use of the ethnographic and oral history methods and archive documents (the State Archive of Altai Krai). The author suggests a hypothesis that during the war the state (after defarming) made local authorities rely on their own sources and natural resources, which returned rural population to the traditions of peasant household. The situation when particular relations between agrarian population and domestic and wild animals are developed is being analyzed. Relations with wolves are considered as an independent research problem. The articles points out the expansion of the hunting area of predators. They approached villages that, with the reduction of livestock, became places of concentration of protein food, while the demographic imbalance weakened the settled rural population. The places of struggle between men and predators are brought to light - the manufacturing sector of collective farms with barnyards, pastures and individual farmsteads; the objects of struggle were small size cattle, the implements of struggle were fire, light, loud sounds. It is stated that relations between the human community and wolf packs aggravated in winter when natural resources were limited. It coincided with the ritual activity of the agricultural folk calendar of holidays and made collisions of men and predators more frequent. The second topic was relations of the rural community with dogs, whose number increased in the 1940s. The article describes their use as shepherds of collective farm cattle and watchers at individual farmsteads. The role of dogs as the source of raw materials (skins, wool) with the lack of byproducts of cattle breeding is considered. The article points out the use of dog skin and wool for sewing clothes and headwear. The use of dogs as transport means with homemade carriages, which is not characteristic of settled agrarian population, is also mentioned. Special attention is paid to the role of great cattle (especially cows) in the system of life sustaining of the rear village. It is proved that they were not only the source of protein (milk, but not meat), but the main burden cattle in individual and collective farmsteads, the most important source of fuel (cow patties and dung cakes); their skins were used in footwear manufacturing, their wool in game-playing culture for making balls for children. A conclusion is made that the wolf turned into the main competitor of man for the natural rent, but man developed a sort of symbiosis with cows and dogs, their functions in individual and collective households extended; their significance in everyday adaptation practices of the struggle with hunger and cold grew greatly.","[Shcheglova, Tatiana K.] Altai State Pedag Univ, Barnaul, Russia","Shcheglova, TK (corresponding author), Altai State Pedag Univ, Barnaul, Russia.",tk_altai@mail.ru,"Shcheglova, Tatiana/W-4064-2017",,,,,10,1,1,2,8,TOMSK STATE UNIV,TOMSK,"LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",1561-7793,1561-803X,,TOMSK STATE UNIV J,Tomsk State Univ.

AimsTo investigate whether food limitation of House Sparrow population size during the winter varied spatially in relation to agricultural landscape intensification and farm management. MethodsWe experimentally increased the winter food supply for populations on farmsteads in replicated landscapes that differed in agricultural intensification (open plains versus mixed farming) and/or farm management (crop farming versus animal husbandry), and estimated possible differences in effects on winter population change. ResultsWe found no effect of supplementary winter feeding on changes in House Sparrow population sizes over the winter, irrespective of agricultural landscape type or presence of animal husbandry at the farm. However, we found a significantly larger winter population decline in mixed farmland and when farms contained animal husbandry. ConclusionsThe results suggest that House Sparrow populations in south Swedish farmland are not primarily limited by winter food availability. Alternatively, supplemental winter feeding may augment interspecific competition or attracts predators, offsetting any positive effect on population change. However, the stronger population decline in landscapes in which more breeding resources may be available (animal husbandry farms, mixed farmland), suggests stronger intraspecific competition during the winter in line with the resource separation hypothesis.","[Von Post, Maria; Stjernman, Martin; Smith, Henrik G.] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Biodivers Sect, Lund, Sweden; [Smith, Henrik G.] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res, Lund, Sweden","Von Post, M (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Biodivers Sect, Lund, Sweden.",maria_von.post@biol.lu.se,,,"Stiftelsen Oscar och Lilli Lamms minne; FORMAS (the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning)Swedish Research Council Formas; Kungliga Fysiografiska Sallskapet; SYSAV Natur- och Viltvard","We would like to thank all the farmers that were involved in this study and that helped out filling up the stations.

Potential mechanisms controlling zooplankton abundance and community structure were considered. Main channel and backwater habitats included in this study differed between a turbid upper pool reach where aquatic macrophytes were sparse and a lower pool reach which was considerably less turbid and had extensive aquatic macrophyte coverage. Samples were collected monthly during the summer over a 2-year period and multivariate analysis was used to examine the spatial and temporal distribution of zooplankton. Significant differences were found in zooplankton density and community composition among habitats and reaches within the pool. Rotifers were the dominant taxa and seasonality was pronounced, with peak densities often occurring in late-spring. Community structure varied by habitat and reach, which suggests that water quality, physical habitat characteristics, presence of aquatic macrophytes, and zooplankton sources can all influence the zooplankton communities of the Upper Mississippi River. Characterization of the zooplankton communities provides a basis for understanding changes in the river ecosystem and examination of zooplankton communities among habitats provides insight into the mechanisms affecting zooplankton dynamics.","[Burdis, Robert M.] Minnesota Dept Nat Resources, Long Term Resource Monitoring Program, Lake City, MN 55041 USA; [Hoxmeier, R.

Although spider mites and honeydew-producing aphids often live on the same host plant, it has not previously been determined whether the ants tending these aphids affect spider mite survival. Using replicated microcosms, each containing an artificial ant nest, we compared experimentally the survival of two-spotted spider mites on kidney bean plants with and without cowpea aphids. Our results showed significantly fewer spider mites on plants with aphids, indicating that spider mites were preyed upon by ants tending aphids. On the other hand, there was no detectable plant-mediated indirect effect of aphids on mite performance in the microcosms. Therefore, we conclude that aphids indirectly reduced the survival of spider mites living on the same host plant via their tending ants. Nonetheless, spider mites did not avoid settling on plant leaves infested with aphids.","[Adachi, Masaaki; Yano, Shuichi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Ecol Informat, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Yano, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Lab Ecol Informat, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",yano@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15K07792]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15K07792] Funding Source: KAKEN",We thank H.

Patterns of egg and tadpole deposition and mortality in the Amazonian poison frog, Dendrobates ventrimaculatus, were monitored in rainforest near Pompeya in Sucumbios Province, Ecuador. Oviposition and tadpole deposition typically ocurred in leaf axils of Heliconia plants. Pools typically received more than one oviposition. Egg survivorship was low, and significantly lower when eggs were deposited in pools with large tadpoles, indicating that cannibalism is an important source of mortality. Tadpole survivorship was also associated with the presence of other tadpoles: most pools ended with only one surviving tadpole, regardless of the number of tadpoles deposited in the pool. Egg deposition was signifcantly less likely for pools that had a tadpole in them, suggesting that adults can detect the presence of tadpoles and avoid ovipositing in pools that contain them. This hypothesis was tested with a series of pool choice experiments, which revealed that D. ventrimaculatus avoid placing either eggs or tadpoles into a pool which contains a large tadpole. Several hypotheses which could explain multiple deposition in this species are discussed.","E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA","Summers, K (corresponding author), E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",,,,,,,21,49,51,0,15,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUN,1999,119,4,,,,,557,564,,10.1007/s004420050819,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,210WU,WOS:000081128300011,28307714,,,,2021-09-27,

The growth rate of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) populations is sensitive to changes in survival of adult females during the breeding season. Much of the PPR is suitable for large-scale wind-energy development and collisions of breeding females with wind turbines may be a novel source of mortality in this area. We assessed the effects of wind energy on breeding female mallard and bluewinged teal (A. discors) survival by monitoring 77 radio-marked mallards and 88 blue-winged teal during the 2009 and 2010 breeding seasons at the Tatanka Wind Farm (TWF) near Kulm, North Dakota. During the same period, we monitored 70 female mallards and 75 blue-winged teal at an adjacent reference site without wind turbines (REF). We used an information-theoretic approach to investigate relationships between female survival and site (TWF vs. REF), year (2009 vs. 2010), and date. Collision mortalities were rare. Only 1 radio-marked female mallard and no blue-winged teal collided with wind turbines. Most mortalities were caused by predators (78.3%; 36/46), irrespective of species and site. For mallards, the best-approximating model indicated that breeding season survival was 1) lowest when a high proportion of radio-marked females were incubating, and 2) dependent on year and site such that expected survival ((S) over cap) in 2009 was higher at TWF ((S) over cap 0.90, 85% CI 0.79-0.98) than at REF ((S) over cap 0.83, 85% CI 0.68-0.95), but expected survival in 2010 was lower at TWF ((S) over cap 0.62, 85% CI 0.46-0.79) than at REF ((S) over cap 0.84, 85% CI 0.72-0.94). For blue-winged teal, the constant model was the best-approximating model and indicated that expected female survival was 0.75 (85% CI 0.69-0.82). The most competitive model for blue-winged teal that included the effect of wind turbines indicated that expected survival at TWF ((S) over cap 0.71, 85% CI 0.62-0.79) was lower than survival at REF ((S) over cap 0.81, 85% CI 0.73-0.89). The limited number of collisions observed for female mallards and blue-winged teal nesting at TWF suggests that wind turbines had no direct effect on female survival. Thus, conservation strategies that include protection of wetland and grassland habitat in wind-developed landscapes will most likely not cause a direct reduction in survival of breeding females due to collisions with wind turbines.

Consequently, females may evolve counterstrategies to retain control of mating. Females can do this directly by resisting copulations, or indirectly by manipulating other males to intervene and prevent the copulation. Uttering copulation calls may be one indirect method for females to trigger male intervention. Copulation calls are commonly observed in mammals, primarily in primates, and also in some birds. Female fowl, Gallus gallus, sometimes utter calls during copulation, particularly in forced copulations with low-ranking males. These loud calls, called distress calls, attract other males and can result in disruption of the copulation, and subsequent mating with the intervening male if he is high ranking. Consequently, uttering such calls can act both to abort a coerced copulation and to generate novel opportunities for females to copulate with higher-ranking males. Nevertheless, uttering loud calls can carry costs, such as attracting predators. Females are therefore predicted to utter copulation calls primarily when doing so offers benefits, which for female fowl requires the presence of another high-ranking male. We tested this prediction by altering the social environment of female domestic fowl, G. g. domesticus. We found that females uttered copulation calls more frequently during copulations in the presence of dominant 'observer' males than in their absence. Thus, we provide evidence of context-dependent utterance of female calls during copulations in a bird. This type of female vocalization is rarely investigated in nonprimate vertebrates, but increased research in this field offers potential to improve understanding of female mate choice strategies and the dynamics of sexual selection.

The model provides insights into the manner in which self- and pathogen regulation combine in determining the coexistence or otherwise of hosts and the structure of biological communities generally. A number of outcomes are possible: coexistence of both hosts with the pathogen, coexistence of both hosts without the pathogen, the predictable elimination of one host by the other, which then remains with the pathogen, and the elimination of either host by the other, contingent on initial densities. However, whereas without self-regulation coexistence of both hosts with their shared pathogen can only be achieved by the partitioning of enemy-free space, with self-regulation there is a wider range of paths, including coexistence mediated by the hosts' resources (analogous to exploiter-mediated coexistence), coexistence mediated by interspecific transmission, and coexistence arising when elements of these other mechanisms are combined. Also, a more affected, regulated-alone host can eliminate a less affected, nonregulated-alone host, but not vice versa; whereas without self-regulation only the opposite outcome is possible. The incorporation of self-regulation adds a necessary element of realism.","NATL TECH UNIV ATHENS,DEPT MATH,GR-147 ATHENS,GREECE; UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT APPL MATH & THEORET PHYS,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND","BEGON, M (corresponding author), UNIV LIVERPOOL,DEPT ENVIRONM & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL,POB 147,LIVERPOOL L69 3BX,ENGLAND.",,,"Bowers, Roger/0000-0001-8207-297X; Begon, Mike/0000-0003-1715-5327",,,,26,108,113,0,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 S WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637",0003-0147,,,AM NAT,Am.

However, the respective importance of absolute and relative size to such thresholds remains uncertain. If absolute size governs expression, morph frequency should differ among environments that influence absolute sizes (e.g. resources, competition), and individuals of the same morph should have similar average sizes across environments. If relative size determines expression, the frequency of each morph may not differ among environments, but morphs within each environment should differ in size relative to one another. We tested these predictions in a salamander (Ambystoma talpoideum) that develops into either a terrestrial metamorph or an aquatic paedomorph. To generate size variation within and among environments, we reared individuals in mesocosm ponds across three conspecific densities. We found that morph frequency did not differ among density treatments, and the morphs were not similarly sized within each density treatment. Instead, within each environment, relatively larger individuals became metamorphs and relatively smaller individuals became paedomorphs. Relative size therefore determined morph development, highlighting the importance of an individual's social context to size-dependent morph induction.","[Moore, Michael P.; Whiteman, Howard H.] Murray State Univ, Watershed Studies Inst, Murray, KY 42071 USA; [Moore, Michael P.; Whiteman, Howard H.] Murray State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Murray, KY 42071 USA; [Moore, Michael P.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Pechmann, Joseph H.

Drought-induced intermittency concentrates aquatic organisms into drying pools. These pools represent refugia from desiccation but apply other stressors, such as extreme temperatures and increased competition for dwindling resources. In the Southern United States, fishes and freshwater mussels are often concentrated together in drying pools during seasonal, summer droughts. This can result in increased competition for food among invertivorous fish, but also increased food abundance for these fish because mussels increase macroinvertebrate abundance. Further, since mussels require fish as hosts for their ectoparasitic larval phase, glochidia, competition with their host during this biologically active time is detrimental to mussels. We conducted an experiment to examine the effects of freshwater mussels on trophic resources and fish survival in drying pools. We stocked mesocosms with juvenile largemouth bass that were infected or uninfected with glochidia and tracked abiotic conditions, trophic resources and fish survival for 10 days. We found that fish survived longer in the presence of adult mussels, regardless of their infection status. We suspect that prey items supplemented by adult freshwater mussels increased the survival of fish. Thus, the presence of adult mussels and the resources that increase in their presence potentially mitigate stress to fish in ecological crunch times. By conserving mussels, fish populations might withstand droughts more easily.","[DuBose, Traci P.; Ashford, Kathryn; Vaughn, Caryn C.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Oklahoma Biol Survey, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Ashford, Kathryn] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Visual Arts, Norman, OK 73019 USA","DuBose, TP (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Oklahoma Biol Survey, 111 E Chesapeake St, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",tracipopejoy@ou.edu,,"Vaughn, Caryn/0000-0003-3749-836X; DuBose, Traci P./0000-0002-9309-4397",,,,96,1,1,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

Cannibalism is most often studied in terms of the benefits it provides the predator, but the prevalence of such an ecologically significant behaviour is also shaped by the costs inherent in a cannibalistic attack. Perhaps most intuitively, the risk of injury when attacking a conspecific of similar or larger size has been considered, and led to the prediction that cannibalism should be most common by larger individuals among asymmetrically sized pairs. This prediction is commonplace in the cannibalism literature, and leads to the more novel hypothesis that siblicide then may be reduced to the extent that maternal investment yields developmental synchrony and size-matched siblings. Here we test these hypotheses in the western black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, by rearing some eggs at 4 degrees C warmer temperatures for 7 days, and thus experimentally creating size asymmetries between clutchmates. Our temperature manipulation was successful at speeding development (eggs reared at warmer temperatures attained their first moult 2.5 days sooner than their counterparts). This developmental asynchrony accelerated cannibalism by more than 3 days relative to control groups in which eggs and spiderlings were all reared at either consistently colder or warmer temperatures. Lastly, the mass and size of an egg were poor predictors of cannibalism in both treatments that included individuals reared at warm temperatures. In contrast, in our control group where both eggs were reared at cooler temperatures, we found that families typified by heavier and larger eggs were slower to show cannibalistic behaviour. We discuss the implications of these findings, paying particular attention to their relevance to the black widow's emerging role as an urban pest.

Ciliates have a higher reproductive capacity than copepods, but copepods can graze on ciliates. Hence we have an omnivorous system in which the inferior grazer can graze on its competitor. We conducted a 3(2) factorial mesocosm experiment with natural plankton communities to explore how the copepod-ciliate interaction affects algal development on the timescale relevant for algal blooms. We used nutrient load and copepod biomass as the experimental variables. Ciliate biomass was positively correlated to nutrient addition and negatively correlated to copepod biomass, with copepod biomass as the predominant factor at the highest densities tested. Both increasing copepod biomass and nutrient addition resulted in increased algal biomass, with the strongest effect on nanoalgae. The mechanism involved was carnivory by copepods and a resulting trophic cascade through ciliates to algae. We conclude that even a moderately high biomass of copepods may promote algal blooms when the initial size distribution of the algal community is appropriate (i.e. dominance of algae eaten primarily by ciliates).","Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondhjem Biol Stn, Dept Biotechnol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondhjem Biol Stn, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; Univ Munich, Dept Biochem 2, Sect Aquat Ecol, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Vadstein, O (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondhjem Biol Stn, Dept Biotechnol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",olav.vadstein@biotech.ntnu.no,"Ross, Donald J/F-7607-2012","Ross, Donald J/0000-0002-8659-3833",,,,28,49,51,0,35,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

This study documents variation in herbivore damage by the chrysomelid beetle Erynephala maritima to the annual forb Atriplex patula in two microhabitats within New England salt marshes: bare patches and dense matrix vegetation. Environmental conditions within bare patches differ from those within matrix vegetation in a number of ways. Bare patches are characterized by the absence of perennial grasses and rushes (matrix vegetation) and greater levels of physical stress, and are rapidly colonized by the fugitive annual, Salicornia europaea, a second host plant of these beetles. Surveys of herbivore damage across three marshes revealed that A. patula in bare patches had a greater proportion of leaves damaged by beetles than those within matrix vegetation. Presence or absence of matrix vegetation and presence or absence of S. europaea were experimentally manipulated, to determine the proximate cause of this pattern. The presence of S. europaea significantly increased the susceptibility of A. patula to herbivory in experimental plots. Both the extent of herbivore damage to plants and the proportion of plants damaged through time were greater in treatments with S. europaea than in controls, regardless of the presence or absence of matrix vegetation. Plants in S. europaea addition treatments were also less likely to survive to reproduction. Decreased survival appears to result from increased herbivory, suggesting that the negative effect of S. europaea on A. patula is mediated indirectly through shared insect herbivores. These results support the hypothesis that indirect interactions between alternative host plants, mediated by insect herbivores, can be important in natural communities.","Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA","Rand, TA (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",,,,,,,41,42,42,0,21,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,OCT,1999,121,1,,,,,39,46,,10.1007/s004420050905,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,245WT,WOS:000083131600006,28307887,,,,2021-09-27,

They graze meadows surrounding talus producing a gradient of grazing pressure extending out from the tarus edge. We asked: 1) how does the physical structure of the talus slope affect pika foraging behavior? and 2) how do differences in foraging behavior affect the relative abundance of different plant functional groups? Pikas at three talus-meadow interfaces differed in the distances they traveled for forage, depending upon the structure of the talus slope. Pikas fed preferentially on vegetation within the talus, ventured into the surrounding meadow when intra-talus Vegetation was rare, and ranged farther when haying than when grazing. They ventured into the surrounding meadow less when talus fields were more fragmented and intra-talus vegetation was more abundant. We tested the effects of pikas on meadow vegetation by excluding pikas from small plots located at various distances from talus edges. When habitat structure forced pikes to venture out from the tarus to forage, they decreased total vegetative biomass by as much as 80% and increased the relative importance of cushion plants and sedges. These effects were undetectable at distances beyond one meter. These patterns appear to result from a change in the relative performance of different plant functional groups caused by herbivory.","Idaho State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA; Idaho State Univ, Ctr Ecol Res & Educ, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA","Roach, WJ (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Dept Biol, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",,"; Huntly, Nancy/A-9329-2010","Inouye, Richard/0000-0002-2759-3390; Huntly, Nancy/0000-0001-6051-6365",,,,43,28,30,2,29,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,FEB,2001,92,2,,,,,315,324,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.920214.x,,,10,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,412NF,WOS:000167560700014,,,,,2021-09-27,

Quantification of these beneficial effects in temperate arable fields is still limited, however, and most studies focus on one sole parameter (i.e., impact on crop productivity, soil quality, biodiversity, etc.). Combined effects are only rarely considered, resulting in a lack of integrated quantification. Here we assess the effect of rows of walnut trees (Juglans regiaL.) on soil organic carbon (SOC), soil nutrient status, the presence of potentially beneficial ground-dwelling arthropods and on the yield and quality of neighboring arable crops. Significantly higher SOC and soil nutrient concentrations were found near the trees, which is assumed to be primarily a result of tree leaf litter input. Abundance of macro-detritivorous arthropods was increased in and near the tree rows, whereas only limited effects of tree presence were found on the presence of the predatory arthropod taxa under study. The yield of all crops under study was reduced as a result of tree presence, with the strongest reductions observed for grain maize and sugar beet near the trees (<10 m). In addition, alteration of crop quality was observed near tree rows with decreased dry matter concentration of grain samples and increased crude protein concentration of winter cereals.","[Pardon, P.; Mertens, J.; Verheyen, K.] Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Geraardsbergsesteenweg 267, B-9090 Gontrode, Belgium; [Pardon, P.; Reheul, D.] Univ Ghent, Dept Plants & Crops, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Pardon, P.; Reubens, B.; Nelissen, V] Flanders Res Inst Agr Fisheries & Food ILVO, Burgemeester Van Gansberghelaan 109, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium; [Coussement, T.; Elsen, A.] Soil Serv Belgium, Willem Croylaan 48, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium","Pardon, P (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Geraardsbergsesteenweg 267, B-9090 Gontrode, Belgium.; Pardon, P (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Plants & Crops, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.; Pardon, P (corresponding author), Flanders Res Inst Agr Fisheries & Food ILVO, Burgemeester Van Gansberghelaan 109, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium.",paul.pardon@ugent.be,"Mertens, Jan/AAM-5319-2021","Mertens, Jan/0000-0003-0656-4459; Verheyen, Kris/0000-0002-2067-9108; Elsen, Annemie/0000-0002-7026-5333",Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship (VLAIO) [135068],The doctoral research of P.

Our aim was to identify the form and ecological causes of annual variation in directional and correlational selection as expressed in the survival and growth of tadpoles. We found directional selection favoring early breeding, but pool choice was under weak stabilizing selection. However, the form of stabilizing selection and the position of the optimum trait value shifted among years with the severity of disturbance and the intensity of biotic interactions. In years when wave wash and pool desiccation were severe, selection shifted to favor tadpoles in habitats where these risks were less pronounced. If predatory dragonfly larvae were abundant, selection favored tadpoles in small pools where dragonflies did not occur. When intraspecific competition was strong, selection favored early broods within a broader range of pool types. The agents of selection in this study-biotic interactions and disturbance-are common to many ecological systems and frequently exhibit temporal variation; this suggests that fluctuating selection may be widespread in natural populations.","[Van Buskirk, Josh] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Smith, David C.] Williams Coll, Biol Dept, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA","Van Buskirk, J (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland.",joseph.vanbuskirk@uzh.ch,,"Van Buskirk, Josh/0000-0002-0486-3626","Edwards family; National Park Service; U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BSR-8516600, BSR-8801008, DEB-9408397]; Swiss NationalfondsSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31-50525.97]; Explorer's Club; Institute of Ecosystem Studies; Williams College","We thank the Edwards family and the National Park Service for support on Isle Royale, and the many undergraduate field assistants who helped catch tadpoles.

However, this simple treatment is typically unable to remove pesticide residues. As a solution, bioaugmentation of sand filter units (i.e., the addition of specific degrader strains) has been proposed as an alternative green technology for targeted pesticide removal. However, the introduced degraders are challenged by (i) micropollutant levels of target residue, (ii) the oligotrophic environment and (iii) competition and predation by the native microorganisms, leading to loss of population and degradation potential. To overcome these challenges, we propose the introduction of a novel hybrid treatment step to the overall treatment process in which reverse osmosis filtration and biodegradation are combined to remove a target micropollutant. Here, the reverse osmosis produces a concentrated retentate that will act as a feed to a dedicated biofilter unit, intended to promote biodegradation potential and stability of an introduced degrader. Subsequently, the purified retentate will be re-mixed with the permeate from reverse osmosis, for re-mineralization and downstream consumption. In our study, we investigated the effect of reverse osmosis retentates on the degradation potential of an introduced degrader. This paper provides the first promising results of this hybrid concept using the 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM)-degrading bacteria Aminobacter sp. MSH1 in batch experiments, spiked with radiolabeled BAM. The results showed an increased degradation potential of MSH1 in retentate waters versus untreated water. Colony-forming units and qPCR showed a stable MSH1 population, despite higher concentrations of salts and metals, and increased growth of native bacteria. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Because this shrimp, Halocaridina rubra ('opae'ula), displays a preference for autotrophic components of epilithon, we hypothesized that tree canopy would reduce their body condition and abundance, but that this would be moderated by nutrient quality of leaf litter (high-quality, non-native, nitrogen-fixing tree vs. low-quality, endemic non-nitrogen-fixing tree). We hypothesized that poeciliid invasion would reduce population size and body condition of H. rubra by direct predation and by inducing reductions in feeding rate. Analysis of stable isotopes (delta D, delta C-13, and delta N-15) showed that direct consumption of leaf litter detritus supplemented H. rubra diet in ponds with canopy cover. In addition, epilithon in ponds with canopy cover was isotopically more similar to leaf litter than epilithon in ponds without canopy cover, and our evidence suggests this may be due to contributions of allochthonous nutrient sources to epilithon assemblages. However, canopy cover, whether native or invasive, did not decrease epilithon growth rates and had little effect on shrimp body condition or population size. In contrast, poeciliid invasion reduced daylight grazing on the benthos, and caused a reduction in body condition among larger shrimp. Our results indicate that primary succession by invasive trees may shift food web linkages in these ponds from autotrophic to heterotrophic support, without negative impacts on native grazer/detritivore communities. We suggest that poeciliid invasions have sub-lethal effects on H. rubra as well as their direct predation effects, with potential long-term implications for the ecosystem function of anchialine ponds and other coastal systems.","[Dudley, Bruce D.; Ostertag, Rebecca] Univ Hawaii, Dept Biol, 200 West Kawili St, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [MacKenzie, Richard A.; Riney, Michael H.] US Forest Serv, Inst Pacific Isl Forestry, USDA, 60 Nowelo St, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Sakihara, Troy S.] State Hawaii, Div Aquat Resources, Dept Land & Nat Resources, 1160 Kamehameha Ave, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Dudley, Bruce D.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, 10 Kyle St, Christchurch 8011, New Zealand","Dudley, BD (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Dept Biol, 200 West Kawili St, Hilo, HI 96720 USA.; Dudley, BD (corresponding author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, 10 Kyle St, Christchurch 8011, New Zealand.",bruce.dudley@niwa.co.nz,,"Ostertag, Rebecca/0000-0002-5747-3285","NSF Hawai'i Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) [EPS-0903833, NSF REU 1005186]","This research was made possible by funding from NSF Hawai'i Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Grant Numbers EPS-0903833, NSF REU 1005186 for student funds, and in-kind support from the USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station.

However, this relationship has received only weak support in non-human primates. This result may be due to the failure to distinguish different forms of vigilance such as antipredatory vigilance and social monitoring. Here, we tested the effects of group size, reproductive status (breeding vs. nonbreeding), and sex on antipredatory vigilance and social monitoring in captive common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Behavioral observations using one-zero sampling were conducted on adult members of three captive groups of small, medium, and large size. Data were analyzed using a series of general linear models (GLMs) analyses of covariance (AN-COVAs). We found an overall negative group size effect on antipredatory vigilance and that breeders, especially breeding males, were significantly more vigilant than nonbreeders. Conversely, we found that social monitoring increased with group size. Unlike the results for antipredatory vigilance, neither breeders and nonbreeders nor males and females differed in their amounts of social monitoring. However, the effect of group size appeared to differ for nonbreeding males compared to all other adults. Our results generally support the idea that individuals in larger groups are safer with breeding males likely playing a prominent role in protection from predation. The increase in social monitoring may be related to increased reproductive competition with the presence of adult offspring, but future studies need to clarify the target of social monitoring in both breeders and nonbreeders. Overall, the study underlines the importance of distinguishing different forms of vigilance and other factors as they may confound the effects of group size on antipredatory vigilance. Am. J.

Yet, the factors that affect observation success are largely unknown for rare and elusive species, such as large carnivores. Here, we took advantage of intensive ground-based monitoring effort and an extensive GPS data set (2000-2018) and developed a winter sightability model for gray wolves (Canis lupus) in northern Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. Our resulting sightability model indicated that observation success was positively affected by the topographic nature of where wolves were in relation to observer locations (viewshed), areas being less forested (openness), and wolf group size, and negatively affected by distance from observer locations. Of these, viewshed had the strongest effect on the probability of observing a wolf, with the odds of observing a wolf being four times more likely when wolves were in the predicted viewshed. Openness was the next most influential covariate, and group size was the least influential. We also tested whether a wolf being harvested from a pack when they were outside of Yellowstone National Park had an effect on wolf sightability. We did not, however, find support for human-induced mortality affecting wolf sightability inside of Yellowstone National Park. Our results indicate that the ability to observe wolves was greatly affected by ecological and landscape-level factors, a finding that is likely to generally extend to other large carnivores. As such, our sightability model highlights the importance of considering landscape structure and variation in large carnivore use of the landscape when conducting observational-based studies.","[Metz, Matthew C.; SunderRaj, Jeremy; Hebblewhite, Mark] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Metz, Matthew C.; Smith, Douglas W.; Stahler, Daniel R.; Cassidy, Kira A.] Yellowstone Ctr Resources, Yellowstone Wolf Project, Yellowstone Natl Pk, WY 82190 USA; [Kohl, Michel T.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Metz, MC (corresponding author), Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Wildlife Biol Program, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.; Metz, MC (corresponding author), Yellowstone Ctr Resources, Yellowstone Wolf Project, Yellowstone Natl Pk, WY 82190 USA.",matthew.metz@umontana.edu,"hebblewhite, mark/G-6164-2013","Metz, Matthew/0000-0002-7037-9891; Kohl, Michel/0000-0001-8218-1455","Yellowstone Forever (Tapeats Fund); National Science Foundation (NSF) Long Term Research in Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0613730, DEB-1245373]; Wesley M.

The creation of forests edges reduces tree-to-tree competition, which may in turn temper water shortage during summer and, as a result, enhance acorn production. To test these two hypotheses we monitored acorn production and predawn water potential during the 2012-2014 period in two holm oak (Quercus Hex) forest archipelagos of the Iberian Peninsula. Acorn production and fragmentation effects did not differ between localities despite of their contrasting climatic conditions (accumulated water deficit from April to August was a 60% higher in the South). In general, forest interiors showed a high proportion of non-producing trees (similar to 50%) while trees at small forest fragments showed high acorn crops (acorn score >= 3, similar to 40% of studied trees). Our results confirmed the expectation that intraspecific competition in small forest fragments was reduced, which alleviated summer water shortage of the trees studied. This reduced water stress entailed an increased acorn production. Overall, our results show that local processes such as fragmentation may counteract climatic differences among localities and could even override the impacts of increased aridity on acorn crops.

Infant survival is a product of external risk factors and investment by kin, especially the mother, and is thus closely tied with the evolution of behavior and life history. Here we present a 9-yr study (2004-2012) of infant survival and sex ratio relative to age and dominance ranks of mothers and the presence of immigrant males in a free-ranging population of gray-cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We consider immigrant males because they are known to increase infant mortality in several other species. We found that infants of older mothers had higher survival than those of younger mothers but that high rank did not confer a significant benefit on infant survival. Female infants had higher survival than male infants. Young, low-ranking females had more male infants than young, high-ranking females, which had slightly more daughters, but this difference declined as females aged because low-ranking females had more daughters as they aged. With limited data, we found a significant relationship between the presence of male immigrants and infant mortality (falls and unexplained disappearances) to 18 mo. Our results suggest that infant survival in gray-cheeked mangabeys is most precarious when mothers must allocate energy to their own growth as well as to their infants, that sons of young mothers are at greatest risk, and that immigrant males can negatively affect infant survival.","[Arlet, Malgorzata E.; Kaasik, Ants; Maend, Raivo] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Dept Zool, EE-50090 Tartu, Estonia; [Arlet, Malgorzata E.] Univ Rennes 1, Anim & Human Ethol Res Unit, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Isbell, Lynne A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Isbell, Lynne A.] Univ Calif Davis, Anim Behav Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Molleman, Freerk] Univ Rennes 1, Ecosyst Biodivers & Evolut Res Unit, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Chancellor, Rebecca L.] West Chester Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Anthropol, W Chester, PA 19383 USA; [Chancellor, Rebecca L.] West Chester Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Sociobiol, W Chester, PA 19383 USA; [Chancellor, Rebecca L.] West Chester Univ Pennsylvania, Dept Psychol, W Chester, PA 19383 USA; [Chapman, Colin A.] McGill Univ, Dept Anthropol, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Chapman, Colin A.] McGill Univ, McGill Sch Environm, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Chapman, Colin A.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; [Carey, James R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Arlet, ME (corresponding author), Univ Rennes 1, Anim & Human Ethol Res Unit, F-35042 Rennes, France.",maarlet@yahoo.com,"Molleman, Freerk/H-2455-2012; Kaasik, Ants/H-2462-2012; Chapman, Colin/S-1911-2019","Molleman, Freerk/0000-0002-6551-266X; Kaasik, Ants/0000-0002-4904-0877; Chapman, Colin/0000-0002-8827-8140","Leakey Foundation; University of California, Davis, Department of AnthropologyUniversity of California System; NIH/NIAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [PO1 A6022500, PO1 A608761]; European Union through the European Social Fund [MJD56]; Estonian Ministry of Education and ScienceMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [0180004s09, 0180122s08, ESF 9215, 7406, 7699, 7522, 8413, GD6019]; European Regional Development Fund (Center of Excellence FIBIR)European Commission","We thank the Uganda Wildlife Authority, Uganda National Council for Science and Technology, and personnel at the Makerere University Biological Field Station in Kanyawara for permission to work in Kibale National Park.

These changes might in turn alter the circadian system due to co-evolutionary mechanisms or correlated selection responses both at behavioural and molecular levels, with knock-on effects on daily physiological processes and behavioural outputs. We examined the evolutionary impact of size-selective mortality on group risk-taking behaviour and the circadian system in a model fish species. We exposed zebrafish Danio rerio to either large or small size-selective harvesting relative to a control over five generations, followed by eight generations during which harvesting was halted to remove maternal effects. Size-selective mortality affected fine-scale timing of behaviours. In particular, small size-selective mortality, typical of specialized fisheries and gape-limited predators targeting smaller size classes, increased group risk-taking behaviuor during feeding and after simulated predator attacks. Moreover, small size-selective mortality increased early peaks of daily activity as well as extended self-feeding daily activity to the photophase compared to controls. By contrast large size-selective mortality, typical of most wild capture fisheries, only showed an almost significant effect of decreasing group risk-taking behaviour during the habituation phase and no clear changes in fine-scale timing of daily behavioural rhythms compared to controls. We also found changes in the molecular circadian core clockwork in response to both size-selective mortality treatments. These changes disappeared in the clock output pathway because both size-selected lines showed similar transcription profiles. This switch downstream to the molecular circadian core clockwork also resulted in similar overall behavioural rhythms (diurnal swimming and self-feeding in the last hours of darkness) independent of the underlying molecular clock. To conclude, our experimental harvest left an asymmetrical evolutionary legacy in group risk-taking behaviour and in fine-scale daily behavioural rhythms. Yet, the overall timing of activity showed evolutionary resistance probably maintained by a molecular switch. Our experimental findings suggest that size-selective mortality can have consequences for behaviour and physiological processes.","[Sbragaglia, Valerio; Arlinghaus, Robert] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Berlin, Germany; [Sbragaglia, Valerio] Inst Marine Sci ICM CSIC, Dept Marine Renewable Resources, Barcelona, Spain; [Lopez-Olmeda, Jose Fernando] Univ Murcia, Dept Physiol, Fac Biol, Reg Campus Int Excellence Campus Mare Nostrum, Murcia, Spain; [Frigato, Elena; Bertolucci, Cristiano] Univ Ferrara, Dept Life Sci & Biotechnol, Ferrara, Italy; [Arlinghaus, Robert] Humboldt Univ, Div Integrat Fisheries & Management, Fac Life Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Arlinghaus, Robert] Humboldt Univ, Integrat Res Inst Transformat Human Environm Syst, Berlin, Germany","Sbragaglia, V (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Berlin, Germany.; Sbragaglia, V (corresponding author), Inst Marine Sci ICM CSIC, Dept Marine Renewable Resources, Barcelona, Spain.",valeriosbra@gmail.com,"Bertolucci, Cristiano/Q-5804-2019; sbragaglia, valerio/K-7592-2014; Lopez-Olmeda, Jose Fernando/K-3848-2014","Bertolucci, Cristiano/0000-0003-0252-3107; sbragaglia, valerio/0000-0002-4775-7049; Lopez-Olmeda, Jose Fernando/0000-0003-4920-5704; Arlinghaus, Robert/0000-0003-2861-527X",Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [RTI2018-100678-A-I00]; Deutscher Akademischer AustauschdienstDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) [91632699],"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Grant/Award Number: IJC2018-035389-I and RYC-2016-20959; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, Grant/Award Number: 91632699; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Grant/Award Number: RTI2018-100678-A-I00",,98,1,1,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Variation in rate of development - from sowing, with synchronous germination, to first flowering and fruiting - was studied in experiments with Senecio vulgaris L. from the Botanic Garden of Cambridge University, England. Experiments revealed that the number of nodes on the main axis could not be used a 'genetic marker; for rate of development. From a large random sample of seed-parents, progenies were raised from open-pollinated capitula. Family lines differed significantly in rate of development, with markedly different degrees of variation within families. Twenty family lines, representing the extremes of variation, were chosen for further study. In cultivated selfed derivatives, the majority of the seed-parents appeared to be behaving as inbred lines for rate of development. Evidence of genetic segregation was detected in only two out of 20 cases. Using the radiate locus as a marker, there was also evidence for a very small amount of outcrossing, with greater values for radiate than non-radiate seed-parents. In an experiment in which six inbred lines, derived from the original seed-parents, were grown out-of-doors on fertile and infertile soils and on fertile soil in a glasshouse, there was considerable developmental flexibility in a number of heritable traits including rate of development. Although the methods of weed control in the Botanic Garden would seem to exert a powerful directional selective force favouring only the quickest-maturing variants of groundsel, a certain amount of variation was nevertheless detected. Many factors are likely to be important in the maintenance of population variation in rate of development in groundsels in the Garden. Several statistically significant lines x soils and lines x places of cultivation were discovered. Thus, the lines did not all behave in the same way in the inside and outside treatments and the rank order of date of maturity of the different lines was not the same in the two soils. This suggests that, in the Garden proper, relative fitness, in the face of weeding pressures, is not fixed but may vary seasonalIy and in soils of different fertility. This behaviour, in a species which is able to reproduce at all seasons of the year, could be a major factor in the maintenance of population variation. Other contributory factors are of great importance, namely, spatial and seasonal variation in the intensity of weeding, developmental flexibility and the effects of predators, pests and diseases.",,"BRIGGS, D (corresponding author), DEPT PLANT SCI,DOWNING ST,CAMBRIDGE CB2 3EA,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,56,8,8,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211",0028-646X,,,NEW PHYTOL,New Phytol.,JUN,1992,121,2,,,,,257,266,,10.1111/j.1469-8137.1992.tb01112.x,,,10,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,JA408,WOS:A1992JA40800012,,Bronze,,,2021-09-27,

Here, we use a linked-read sequencing strategy on a single female N. tenuis. From this, we assembled the 355 Mbp genome and delivered an ab initio, homology-based and evidence-based annotation. Along the way, the bacterial contamination was removed from the assembly. In addition, bacterial lateral gene transfer (LGT) candidates were detected in the N. tenuis genome. The complete gene set is composed of 24 688 genes; the associated proteins were compared to other hemipterans (Cimex lectularis, Halyomorpha halys and Acyrthosiphon pisum). We visualized the genome using various cytogenetic techniques, such as karyotyping, CGH and GISH, indicating a karyotype of 2n = 32. Additional analyses include the localization of 18S rDNA and unique satellite probes as well as pooled sequencing to assess nucleotide diversity and neutrality of the commercial population.

Here, we update our previous assessments of the importance of seagrass-herbivore interactions, focusing on recent studies that have examined (1) the diversity of herbivores feeding on live seagrass leaves; (2) the factors that determine the ability of seagrasses to respond to herbivore damage; (3) how potential chemical deterrents, and structural defenses, in seagrass leaves influence herbivore consumption; (4) how climate-driven changes in herbivore identity might change grazing intensity in temperate seagrasses; (5) the effects of herbivory on pollen, flowers, fruits, and seeds of seagrasses; and (6) the effects of human removal of seagrass megaherbivores and the top-down effects of overfishing top predators on seagrass consumption. We also identify important gaps in our understanding of the broadly defined topic of herbivory in seagrass-dominated ecosystems. Specifically, we suggest that future studies should consider focusing on increasing our understanding of herbivore foraging strategies, quantifying the impact of herbivory on seagrass reproductive biology, including effects on the fates of flowers, fruits, and seeds and documenting the commonness of compensatory responses and chemical defenses to grazing. Studies of the roles of the nutritional content (as measured by C/N/P ratios), in determining herbivore feeding preferences, remain fertile grounds for future studies, as do additional experiments to quantify the relative roles of top-down and bottom-up factors in determining seagrass abundance and energy fluxes in seagrass meadows.","[Valentine, John F.; Heck, Kenneth L., Jr.] Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA; [Valentine, John F.; Heck, Kenneth L., Jr.] Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, LSCB 25,5871 USA Dr North, Mobile, AL 36688 USA","Valentine, JF (corresponding author), Dauphin Isl Sea Lab, 101 Bienville Blvd, Dauphin Isl, AL 36528 USA.; Valentine, JF (corresponding author), Univ S Alabama, Dept Marine Sci, LSCB 25,5871 USA Dr North, Mobile, AL 36688 USA.",jvalentine@disl.edu,,"Valentine, John/0000-0001-9112-2254","National Undersea Research Center at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington; NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (UNCW) [9537, NA08OAR4300863]; Nature Conservancy's Ecosystem Research Program [HO-CSD-083100]; National Marine Fisheries Service (MARFIN) [NA17FF2015]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 919102217]; National Science Foundation (Alabama) Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive ResearchNational Science Foundation (NSF) [R11-8996152]; Environmental Protection Agency's EMAP program [2350-3-0882]; National Park Service [2350-3-0882]","We received financial support from the National Undersea Research Center at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington and the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (UNCW #9537 and NA08OAR4300863), The Nature Conservancy's Ecosystem Research Program (HO-CSD-083100 AL), The National Marine Fisheries Service (MARFIN Grant No: NA17FF2015), and NSF (awards OCE 919102217) The National Science Foundation (Alabama) Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (R11-8996152), the DISPro program, a joint program between the Environmental Protection Agency's EMAP program and the National Park Service (Grant No. 2350-3-0882).",,188,1,1,7,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-2723,1559-2731,,ESTUAR COAST,Estuaries Coasts,MAR,2021,44,2,,,SI,,491,505,,10.1007/s12237-020-00849-3,,OCT 2020,15,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,PX7PE,WOS:000581548600001,,,,,2021-09-27,

Numerical experiments predict that selection of a single genotype, co-persistence of both genotypes, and extinction are possible outcomes depending on environmental conditions. Our results indicated that in spatially homogenous settings, co-persistence of both genotypes can occur when population dynamics oscillate on limit cycles near a key stoichiometric threshold on food quality. Under spatially heterogeneous settings, dynamics are more complex, where co-persistence is observed on limit cycles, as well as stable equilibria.","[Dissanayake, Chandani; Juan, Lourdes; Long, Kevin R.; Peace, Angela; Rana, Md Masud] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Dissanayake, Chandani] Sri Lanka Technol Campus, Colombo, Sri Lanka","Juan, L (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",chandanid@sltc.edu.lk; lourdes.juan@ttu.edu; krlong014@gmail.com; a.peace@ttu.edu; md-masud.rana@ttu.edu,,"Juan, Lourdes/0000-0002-4208-7330; Peace, Angela/0000-0001-8200-8839",,,,43,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0092-8240,1522-9602,,B MATH BIOL,Bull.

Here we use original data from a unique natural experiment to study some of the mechanisms by which African lions Panthera leo impact on African wild dogs Lycaon pictus. Using a study site where wild dogs outnumbered lions for several years prior to lion population recovery, we aimed to investigate whether or not, and by which means, wild dog populations are regulated and influenced by lions. We used 38 pack-years of demographic and behavioural data across two 4-year periods where lion density differed 20-fold (pre-lion era: 1996-1999 and lion era: 2010-2013) to assess how lions may affect wild dog pack size and age structure, litter size and pup survival (n = 329 pups), as well as den site selection (n = 46 dens). Pack size was significantly greater during the pre-lion era. The pup to adult ratio was lower during the lion era and the change in pack composition was directly attributable to significantly greater lion-induced pup mortality. We also demonstrate a behavioural shift, with locations selected for the vulnerable denning period being in more rugged terrain and in areas with lower prey densities during the lion era, as compared with the pre-lion era. Lower adult recruitment into a population of an obligate cooperative breeder like the African wild dog can have complex consequences, including on feeding and defence of young, and mate finding.","[Groom, R.

As with later life-history switch points, plasticity in hatching timing may have carryover effects that affect subsequent interactions with predators and competitors. Moreover, the strength of such effects of hatching plasticity may be context dependent. We used red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, to test for lasting effects of hatching timing (four or six days post-oviposition) under factorial combinations of resource levels (high or low) and predation risk (none, caged, or lethal Pantala flavescens dragonfly naiads). Tadpoles were raised in 400-L mesocosms in Gamboa, Panama, from hatching until all animals had metamorphosed or died, allowing assessment of effects across a nearly six-month period of metamorphosis. Hatching early reduced survival to metamorphosis, increased larval growth, and had context-dependent effects on metamorph phenotypes. Early during the period of metamorph emergence, early-hatched animals were larger than late-hatched ones, but this effect attenuated over time. Early-hatched animals also left the water with relatively longer tails. Lethal predators dramatically reduced survival to metamorphosis, with most mortality occurring early in the larval period. Predator effects on the timing of metamorphosis and metamorph size and tail length depended upon resources. For example, lethal predators reduced larval periods, and this effect was stronger with low resources. Predators affected metamorph size early in the period of metamorphosis, whereas resource levels were a stronger determinant of phenotype for animals that metamorphosed later. Effects of hatching timing were detectable on top of strong effects of larval predators and resources, across two subsequent life stages, and some were as strong as or stronger than effects of resources. Plasticity in hatching timing is ecologically important and currently underappreciated. Effects on metamorph numbers and phenotypes may impact subsequent interactions with predators, competitors, and mates, with potentially cascading effects on recruitment and fitness.","[Touchon, Justin C.; McCoy, Michael W.; Warkentin, Karen M.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Touchon, Justin C.; Warkentin, Karen M.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; [McCoy, Michael W.] E Carolina Univ, Dept Biol, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Vonesh, James R.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA","Touchon, JC (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Apartado Postal 0843-03092, Balboa, Panama.",TouchonJC@si.edu,"; Vonesh, James/I-1573-2013","McCoy, Michael/0000-0002-7993-6236; Vonesh, James/0000-0003-2481-9988; Warkentin, Karen/0000-0002-7804-800X","Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente de Panama for permits [SC/A-32-09, SC/A-73-09]; Boston University IACUC [08-011]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0717220, DEB-0716923]","We thank the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) for logistical support and the Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente de Panama for permits (SC/A-32-09 and SC/A-73-09).

Wild populations of squirrel monkeys (Saimiri spp.) appear to conform to the predictions of the predation/competition socioecological model (Sterck et al. in Behav Ecol Sociobiol 41:291-309, 1997) and the dispersal/foraging efficiency model (Isbell in Kinship and behavior in primates. Oxford University, New York, pp 71-108, 2004). However, squirrel monkeys in captivity are reported to maintain patterns of social behavior observed in their wild conspecifics despite different food distribution, predation risk, and dispersal options. This behavioral similarity suggests squirrel monkeys' social behavior has limited flexibility to respond to environmental changes. In this study, we experimentally evaluated the flexibility of social behavior within a captive group of S. sciureus. First, we determined whether dominance and affiliative relationships observed under normal laboratory conditions (with abundant, widely distributed, food; no dispersal option; and no predators) better matched published reports of relationships among wild conspecifics or the predictions of the predation/competition model. Second, we made preferred food items defensible to determine whether dominance interactions would become more frequent and linear, as predicted by the model. The model correctly predicted rates of dominance behavior in both conditions and a linear hierarchy in the defensible food condition but did not predict the consistent affiliative relationships and linear dominance hierarchy observed in normal lab conditions. Although hierarchies were linear and male dominant, manipulating food distribution changed the dominant individual within each sex. Our findings suggest interaction rates adapt more rapidly than social structure to environmental changes in Saimiri and recommend caution in interpreting tests of socioecological models.","[Bashaw, Meredith J.; McIntyre, Chelsea; Salenetri, Nicole D.] Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Psychol, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA","Bashaw, MJ (corresponding author), Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Psychol, POB 3003, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA.",mbashaw@alumni.duke.edu,,,,,,48,1,1,0,49,SPRINGER TOKYO,TOKYO,"1-11-11 KUDAN-KITA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 102-0073, JAPAN",0032-8332,,,PRIMATES,Primates,OCT,2011,52,4,,,,,361,371,,10.1007/s10329-011-0263-5,,,11,Zoology,Zoology,833ES,WOS:000295865400007,21826586,,,,2021-09-27,

Environmental stressors have both lethal and sublethal effects, such as altered developmental rates and the induction of malformations. Ecological interactions, including predation and competition, often amplify such effects, for instance by inducing behavioural changes that increase susceptibility to the stress. 2. Using experimental mesocosms, we asked whether the density of conspecific competitors and predation risk from larval water beetles (Dytiscus spp.) affect the development of malformations in tadpoles of the wood frog (Rana sylvatica). We also examined whether such malformities increase the susceptibility of tadpoles to predation. 3. The risk of predation decreased the frequency of malformities in both low- and high-density treatments, although this effect was greater at low density. Behavioural observations suggested that reductions in activity by amphibian larvae induced by predators mediated these responses by decreasing cumulative exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation, the putative stressor causing the observed malformity. These results suggest that predators can reduce negative impacts of stressors by inducing behavioural changes in prey organisms. 4. Malformed individuals were twice as vulnerable to predators as non-malformed individuals, suggesting that sublethal effects can ultimately cause increased mortality.","[Michel, Matt J.; Burke, Stephanie] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Michel, MJ (corresponding author), St Louis Univ, 136 Macelwane Hall, St Louis, MO 63103 USA.",mmichel3@slu.edu,,,University of Notre Dame Environmental Research Center; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF DBI04-04983],"G.

Bioturbation by detritivores in small headwater streams could affect community structure by reintroducing buried detrital resources into the food web and could also affect the distribution of various taxa on detritus. We evaluated the ability of the caddisfly Pycnopsyche gentilis to uncover experimentally buried leaves in a headwater stream. Packs of leaves were placed in enclosures and covered with a known volume of sediment. We added 0, 3 or 6 large Pycnopsyche to the enclosures which were permeable to most other invertebrate taxa. Leaf packs were sampled after 23 days and leaf pack mass, the amount of sediment covering the leaf packs, and macro- and microinvertebrate densities on leaf packs were quantified. There was a significant negative relationship between Pycnopsyche density and leaf pack mass. Pycnopsyche also reduced the volume of sediment covering leaf packs. Pycnopsyche had complex effects on the abundance of invertebrate taxa associated with the leaves. Some taxa exhibited their highest abundance in the 3 Pycnopsyche treatment while others exhibited non-significant increases as Pycnopsyche density increased. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of Pycnopsyche (e.g. uncovering leaves which increases the availability of habitat and food) outweigh any negative effects (e.g. disturbance, encounter competition) of the caddisfly when it is present at lower densities. However, the negative impacts of Pycnopsyche appear to outweigh the positive effects via sediment removal at higher caddisfly densities for some taxa. Our results suggest that bioturbating organisms in streams have the potential to reintroduce organic matter to detrital food webs and affect the distribution and abundance of benthic taxa associated with organic matter.","[Creed, Robert P.; Taylor, Amy; Pflaum, James R.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA","Creed, RP (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Dept Biol, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",creedrp@appstate.edu,,,Dept of Biology; Graduate School at Appalachian State Univ.,"Funding for this research was provided by the Dept of Biology and the Graduate School at Appalachian State Univ.

Juvenile three-spot damselfish (Stegastes planifrons) were more closely aggregated in patch reef habitat than on continuous back reef. Agonistic interactions were more frequent but feeding rates were lower in the patch versus the continuous reef habitat. Growth rates were lower in patch reef habitat than on the continuous reef, but mortality rates did not differ. A separate experiment using standard habitat units demonstrated that the patterns observed in natural habitat were the result of the spatial distribution of the habitat patches rather than resource differences between habitats. Our results do not follow the predictions of simple IFD or IDD models. This deviation from IFD and IDD predictions may be the result of a number of factors, including lack of perfect information about habitat patches, high movement costs, and higher encounter rates of dispersed patches. Our results demonstrate that behavioral interactions are an integral part of population dynamics and that it is necessary to consider the spatial organization of the habitat in both behavioral and ecological investigations.","Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; Univ Auckland, Leigh Marine Lab, Warkworth, New Zealand; Northeastern Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Univ Windsor, Dept Biol, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada","Levin, PS (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",phil.levin@noaa.gov,"Sale, Peter/AAM-5414-2020",,,,,85,44,44,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

At higher food densities, slower developing herring, Clupea harengus, larvae in the pre-metamorphic stage may co-occur with more developed, post-metamorphic individuals. The development of schooling in herring is closely associated with metamorphosis. To assess whether the presence of schooling conspecifics encouraged the premature development of schooling in larvae, laboratory reared larvae (length 29-31 mm) were exposed to wild-caught schooling juveniles (length 55 mm) for the duration of the experiment. Observations of larvae from the experimental group were carried out for 37 days and the behaviour of the fish was recorded on video for subsequent analysis. These larvae were observed in the presence and absence of schooling juveniles with no food in the observation tank, and a few minutes and Ih after food was added. The behaviour of these two groups (juveniles present and juveniles absent) was compared with that of two additional groups (different rearing densities), where the larvae had not been exposed to schooling herring. The exposure to schooling conspecifics did not affect the degree of interaction among herring larvae unless the juveniles were present in the observation tank. Consequently, in the presence of a school the larvae seemed to opt for the increased protection of the school, regardless of associated disadvantages, such as greater competition for food. These findings are discussed in relation to larval vulnerability to predators.

Mole rats were initially indifferent or slightly attracted to the odour of both conspecific and heterospecific same-sex urine although their behaviour indicated that they could smell it. When animals were given the opportunity to touch the stimulus with their noses, they tended to avoid both types of urine. When exposed to the odour alone, in a separate experiment that followed the touch experiment, the avoidance tendency remained. These results suggest that the animal learns about the odour of the urine through nasal contact with it.

The environment of an individual vole can be considered to be predictable when the risks of predation and intra- and interspecific competition change with the cycle, such that both are high during the population highs of voles. The risk of predation is also high during the vole crash. After the crash, the vole population is characterized by low intra- and interspecific competition and low predation pressure. The main predators affecting voles during the crash are the small mustelids, least weasel and stoat. The density of these specialist predators declines drastically during the winter after the vole crash. We studied experimentally the impact of the perceived presence of stoats on the breeding and mating behaviour of voles. In a series of breeding experiments with bank voles, Clethrionomys glareolus, both old and young females suppressed breeding when exposed to the odour of stoats, Mustela erminea. The weights of females decreased in both experimental and control groups, but more among the voles under odour exposition. It seems that females actively avoided copulations under high predation risk and that breeding suppression is mediated by a change in female mating behaviour. There was no change in male behaviour or physical condition between the experimental and control treatments. An alternative mechanism for the observed breeding suppression could be the one caused by decreased feeding in females mediated with low energy intake which does not allow breeding. Regardless of its mechanism, delay of breeding should increase the probability of non-breeding females to survive to the next breeding season. The females surviving the crash should gain a strong selective advantage in a predator-free environment of the subsequent breeding season, which could explain the adaptive function of this antipredatory strategy.","UNIV JYVASKYLA,KONNEVESI RES STN,SF-Y0351 JYVASKYLA,FINLAND","YLONEN, H (corresponding author), UNIV JYVASKYLA,DEPT BIOL,POB 35,SF-Y0351 JYVASKYLA,FINLAND.",,,,,,,47,85,89,0,18,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0269-7653,,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

First, we used a bioassay to define the quality of Epilobium for A. varians. We established cohorts of first-instar A. varians on fireweed shoots of different heights. Development time, size at maturity, and the number and size of embryos per adult were significantly correlated with plant height. Therefore, plant height provided an indirect measure of plant quality. Second, we experimentally tested the effects of plant height and tending by ants on the growth of aphid populations. We conducted this experiment in the absence of natural enemies of A. varians in order to examine the direct link between plants, aphids and ants, rather than the indirect links involving the natural enemies of aphids. As expected, population growth of A. varians on individual Epilobium ramets was positively correlated with plant height. However, in the absence of natural enemies, the effect of ants on the growth of aphid populations did not vary with plant height. The absence of an interaction between tending by ants and plant quality was probably due to two processes. First, although there were more ants tending on higher quality host plants, the absolute number of ants tending aphids was low and the increase in the number of ants with increases in plant quality was small. Second, in the absence of natural enemies and at initial densities of approximately 100 aphids per plant, we were unable to detect a significant effect of ants on the growth of aphid populations. We conclude that host-plant mediation did not occur in this aphid-ant interaction, but we do not know whether this was the result of 1) excluding predators, 2) using initial densities above which ants no longer benefit aphids, 3) the low numbers of ants, or 4) small sample sizes.",,"BRETON, LM (corresponding author), UNIV ALBERTA,DEPT ZOOL,EDMONTON T6G 2E9,ALBERTA,CANADA.",,,,,,,26,34,37,0,18,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAR,1992,63,2,,,,,253,259,,10.2307/3545385,,,7,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HL789,WOS:A1992HL78900012,,,,,2021-09-27,

This may drive morphological divergences from their mainland counterparts, presenting gigantism and frequently sexual dimorphism. The aim of this study was to determine morphological divergence (i.e. head and limbs) and sexual dimorphism in the arboreal lizard Urosaurus bicarinatus on San Agustin Island off the Mexican Pacific Coast. We measured several morphological structures of U. bicarinatus on San Agustin Island, as well as on the adjacent mainland in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. Additionally, we measured individuals from the state of Michoacan and from a preserved collection with individuals from Michoacan and Guerrero. Our results indicated a divergence and an expansion of the morphological space of the island population compared with the mainland. The divergence was accompanied by dwarfism (reduction of the head and limbs with respect to body size) and a lack of sexual dimorphism in morphology and size. Our study contributes to understanding the effect of insularity on lizards' populations and enriches the knowledge concerning phrynosomatids such as U. bicarinatus.","[Siliceo-Cantero, H.

Reptiles use sensory cues, such as smell (chemoreception), to detect threats and flee. In Mediterranean ecosystems, fire is a threat faced by reptiles. We hypothesized that the Mediterranean lizard Psammodromus algirus recognizes the threat of fire by detecting the smoke, which triggers a behavioral response that enhances survival in fire-prone ecosystems. We predicted that lizards from fire-prone ecosystems will be more sensitive to fire stimulus than those from ecosystems that rarely burn. We conducted a terrarium experiment in which lizards from habitats with contrasted fire regimes (fire-prone vs. non-fire-prone) were exposed to smoke versus control (false smoke) treatment. We found that, in populations from fire-prone habitats, more lizards reacted to smoke, and their behavioral response was more intense than in lizard populations from non-fire-prone habitats. Our results suggest that an enhanced response to smoke may be adaptive in lizards from fire-prone ecosystems as it increases the chance for survival. We provide evidence that fire is likely an evolutionary driver shaping behavioral traits in lizard populations exposed to frequent wildfires. Understanding ecological and evolutionary processes shaping animal populations is relevant for species conservation in a changing fire regime world.","[Alvarez-Ruiz, Lola; Pausas, Juli G.] Ctr Invest Desertificac CIDE CSIC, Dept Ecol, Ctra Naquera Km 4-5, Valencia 46113, Spain; [Belliure, Josabel] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Ciencias Vida, UD Ecol, AP 20 Campus Univ, Madrid 28805, Spain","Alvarez-Ruiz, L (corresponding author), Ctr Invest Desertificac CIDE CSIC, Dept Ecol, Ctra Naquera Km 4-5, Valencia 46113, Spain.",lolaalvarez.r@gmail.com,,,"Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of the Spanish Government [CGL2015-64086-P, PGC2018-096569-B-I00, BES-2016-078225]","This work was supported by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of the Spanish Government (grant numbers CGL2015-64086-P, PGC2018-096569-B-I00, and BES-2016-078225)",,61,0,0,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

We recently proposed a new dynamic model of bacteria-phage interactions in which lysogeny predominates at high microbial abundance and growth rates. This model, named Piggyback-the-Winner (PtW), contrasts to current accepted models on the frequency of lysis and lysogeny and predicts that phages integrate into their hosts' genomes as prophages when microbial abundances and growth rates are high. According to PtW, switching to the temperate life cycle reduces phage predation control on bacterial abundance and confers superinfection exclusion, preventing that a closely-related phage infects the same bacterial cell. Here we examine how PtW is important for metazoans. Specifically, we postulate that PtW and the recently described bacteriophage adherence to mucus (BAM) model are strongly interrelated and have an important role in the development of the microbiome. In BAM, phage produced by the microbiome attach to mucins and protect underlying epithelial cells from invading bacteria. Spatial structuring of the mucus creates a gradient of phage replication strategies consistent with PtW. We predict that lysogeny is favored at the top mucosal layer and lytic predation predominates in the bacteria-sparse intermediary layers. The lysogeny confers competitive advantage to commensals against niche invasion and the lytic infection eliminates potential pathogens from deeper mucus layers.","[Silveira, Cynthia B.; Rohwer, Forest L.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA","Silveira, CB; Rohwer, FL (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",cynthiabsilveira@gmail.com; frohwer@gmail.com,"Rohwer, Forest/AAC-5315-2019","Silveira, Cynthia/0000-0002-9533-5588",Science Without Borders Program (CNPq-Brazil); Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation,"We thank Aaron Hartman, Antoni Luque, Parag Katira, Andreas Haas, Nathan Robinett and the SDSU bio-math group for manuscript review and thoughtful discussions.

In two sets of enclosure experiments, we studied the spatial pattern, relocation rates, pit construction rates, and microhabitat preference of Myrmeleon hyalinus larvae. 2. We showed that M. hyalinus larvae actively prefer shady sites and often relocate to shady areas when exposed to the sun. This behaviour may constitute a life-saving strategy in desert environments. 3. The initial spatial pattern in a cluster of antlion larvae did not affect the final pattern, relocation rate, or the pathway moved while relocating. We interpret this finding to mean that the spatial pattern of M. hyalinus larvae is mainly influenced by factors operating at large time-scales, such as exploitation competition and physical-microclimatological constraints, rather than those operating at shorter time-scales, such as interference competition. 4. In contrast, the likelihood of pit construction was positively correlated with nearest neighbour distance, possibly as a result of interference competition. 5. Pit construction rates were constant throughout the experiment, while relocation rates decreased with time. 6. Contrary to previous studies, we found no correlation between body mass and spatial position inside the cluster, suggesting that these differences are the products of slower processes (e.g. exploitation and body condition).","[Scharf, Inon; Hollender, Yael; Subach, Aziz; Ovadia, Ofer] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Scharf, I (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",schari@bgu.ac.il,"Scharf, Inon/AAF-2343-2020; Ovadia, Ofer OO/C-8292-2012","Scharf, Inon/0000-0002-8506-7161; Ovadia, Ofer/0000-0002-4941-4947",,,,39,25,26,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0307-6946,,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

Fluprazine (1-5 mg/kg) inhibited maternal attack on female, but not on male intruders. Thus, phenotypically different attack behaviors (offence and defence respectively) which have different functions may be modulated by different neurochemical substrates. Intrasexual attack and infanticide which are phenotypically different, but share similar functions (i.e. competition for mates and resources) were equally inhibited by Fluprazine (2 mg/kg) both in males and females of wild and laboratory mice. This indicates that the neural substrates of these behaviors are related and similarly regulated in the two sexes. Fluprazine was used to test the prediction of the evolutionary model on fighting strategies in male-male asymmetric contests as far as fighting ability and resource value (mating and cohabitation with a female) are concerned. Fluprazine inhibited the intensity of fighting (i.e. more 'defensive' behavioral phenotype of attack) only in animals without previous positive fighting experience, suggesting that different behavioral strategies are based on different neurochemical modulation. Experience of attack also influenced the effects of CDP (2.5-5 mg/kg) in both lactating females and male resident mice. The reported proaggressive effects of benzodiazepines were observed only in animals with prior fighting experience in both cases. Thus the understanding of the effects of drugs on behavior demands consideration of the biological variability (e.g. genetic, previous experience and/or interindividual diferences) and the adaptive significance of behavior in the experimental context. On this background ethopharmacology can be defined as an evolutionary approach to the study of a drugs effect on neurochemical mechanisms and functions of behavior. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Disturbance, biotic resistance of native biological communities and propagule pressure, are likely the important factors influencing the spread of invasive grasses and their influence on changing fire regimes. Over a 5-year period (2011-2016), we tested how the potential loss of biotic resistance of native plant and native rodent communities related to fire and rodent exclusion treatments, in concert with increased propagule pressure affected the establishment of Bromus tectorum L. (cheatgrass) and the spread of secondary fires. Our study results suggest that native plant and native rodent communities contribute to biotic resistance against cheatgrass invasion and that fire and high propagule pressure act to diminish biotic resistance by native communities. Five years into the study, cheatgrass establishment was 11-fold greater in burned plots than in unburned plots (with native plant communities still intact), 2.4-fold greater in rodent exclusion plots than rodent access plots and 1.8-fold greater with increased propagule pressure. At the start of the experiment in 2011 cheatgrass was present in the experimental blocks but at very low density (<1 plant/m(2)). However, by 2016, burned-rodent excluded plots were fully invaded (1625 stems/m(2)). High propagule pressure released cheatgrass from biotic resistance of rodent communities in post-fire conditions but had minimal effects on the biotic resistance of native plant communities in unburned plots. Fire in combination with either rodent exclusion or high cheatgrass propagule pressure produced higher density cheatgrass stands that were positively correlated with the spread of secondary fires that are characteristic of invasive grass-fire cycles. Synthesis. Loss of native plant cover or reduction in rodent populations due to fire, extreme climatic events or disease outbreaks, which are increasing with human activity, may provide windows of opportunity for invasive grasses to escape biotic resistance and reinforce invasive grass-fire cycles.","[St Clair, Samuel B.; Bishop, Tara B.

Lion (Panthera leo Linnaeus, 1758) populations experience a range of ecological and human influences that affect their demography. Few lion populations have reliable estimates of population size, trends in these, or demographic profiles. Threats such as those imposed by diseases are thus hard to evaluate and respond to. Aims. To calibrate call-up stations and de. ne survey effort required to achieve estimates with known precision, and extract age structures and estimate survival rates, to estimate lion numbers, sex and age structure and survival rates, and then to evaluate the effect of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) on estimates of lion density and survival. Methods. By using call-up stations, we developed a statistically robust approach to estimate selected population variables and evaluated the perceived threat of bTB in landscapes of varying prey biomass in the Kruger National Park. Key results. The size of the lion population was stable, although long intervals between present and historical estimates limit this conclusion. Density and survival rates associated positively with prey biomass, and a positive association was detected between the survival rate and bTB prevalence, with survival being higher in areas that had high prevalence of bTB. Male survival was lower than female survival, disregarding the effects of prey biomass or bTB prevalence. Body condition of lions was high, with scores lower at low to medium prey density. Conclusions. The effect of an exotic disease on the Kruger lion population may be negligible at present. Intraspecific competition in areas where lions live at high densities affects survival rate. However, droughts could disrupt the hierarchical influences of prey biomass and bTB prevalence on lion densities and survival. Implications. To evaluate the effect of an exotic disease on lion demography, population surveys should include age- and sex-structure assessments, complemented with focal studies of fecundity. This reflects the importance of understanding host-disease dynamics to inform management options.","[Ferreira, Sam M.] SANParks, Sci Serv, ZA-1350 Skukuza, South Africa; [Funston, Paul J.] Tshwane Univ Technol, Nat Conservat Dept, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa","Ferreira, SM (corresponding author), SANParks, Sci Serv, ZA-1350 Skukuza, South Africa.",SamF@sanparks.org,,,Conservation Force; Tshwane University of Technology (Department of Nature Conservation and Faculty Research Committee),"The South African National Parks are thanked for the opportunity to conduct this research in Kruger National Park.

While a given ecological driver might have a strong impact in one region, it does not necessarily hold that its importance will extend elsewhere. Coral reefs provide a striking example in that coral communities have low resilience in the Atlantic and remarkable resilience in parts of the species-rich Pacific. Recent experimental evidence from the Atlantic finds that fishing of large herbivorous fish can be a strong driver of coral resilience. Here, we repeat the Atlantic experiment in the highly resilient forereef of Moorea (French Polynesia), which has repeatedly recovered from disturbances. A combination of cages, fish deterrents (FDs), and controls allowed us to simulate the consequences of fishing large herbivores on algal assemblages, coral recruitment, and the demographic rates of coral juveniles. We find that the impacts of removing large herbivorous reef fish vary with early coral ontogeny. Reduced herbivore access led to a modest macroalgal bloom and reduction in coral recruitment. However, larger juvenile corals (> 1 cm diameter) survived better and grew faster under these conditions because of a reduction in corallivory. To determine the net impact of losing larger herbivorous fish, we combined experimental results with estimated demographic parameters in an individual-based model. Simulating coral recovery trajectories for five years, we find that protecting larger reef fish led to better recovery in 66-99% of simulations, depending on underlying assumptions (with the more credible assumptions being associated with greater likelihood of net positive impacts). While we find that fishing effects are detrimental to corals in both the Atlantic and Pacific systems studied, the nature of the interactions varied markedly. In the identical previously-published study in the Atlantic, macroalgae exhibited a rapid bloom and caused a sufficiently large reduction in coral recruitment to force a predicted ecosystem shift to an alternative attractor. The commensurate macroalgal bloom in Moorea was weak yet the corals were two orders of magnitude more sensitive to its presence. We do not suggest that a reduction in recruitment in Moorea will lead to alternative attractors but the long-term risks of a reduction in recovery rate are cause for concern as rates of coral mortality are projected to increase.

Most studies addressing the causes of the recent increases and expansions of mesopredators in many ecosystems have focused on the top-down, releasing effect of extinctions of large apex predators. However, in the case of the northward expansion of the red fox into the arctic tundra, a bottom-up effect of increased resource availability has been proposed, an effect that can counteract prey shortage in the low phase of the multi-annual rodent cycle. Resource subsidies both with marine and with terrestrial origins could potentially be involved. 2. During different phases of a multi-annual rodent cycle, we investigated the seasonal dynamics and spatial pattern of resource use by red foxes across a coast to inland low arctic tundra gradient, Varanger Peninsula, Norway. We employed two complementary methods of diet analyses: stomach contents and stable isotope analysis. 3. We found that inland red foxes primarily subsisted on reindeer carrions during the low phase of a small rodent population cycle. Lemmings became the most important food item towards the peak phase of the rodent cycle, despite being less abundant than sympatric voles. Isotopic signatures of tissue from both predator and prey also revealed that red foxes near the coast used marine-derived subsidies in the winter, but these allochthonous resources did not spillover to adult foxes living beyond 20-25 km from the coast. 4. Although more needs to be learned about the link between increasing primary productivity due to climatic warming and trophic dynamics in tundra ecosystems, we suggest that changes in reindeer management through a bottom-up effect, at least regionally, may have paved the way towards the establishment of a new mesopredator in the tundra biome.","[Killengreen, Siw T.; Lecomte, Nicolas; Ehrich, Dorothee; Schott, Tino; Yoccoz, Nigel G.; Ims, Rolf A.] Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway","Killengreen, ST (corresponding author), Univ Tromso, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",siw.killengreen@uit.no,"Ehrich, Dorothee/F-6492-2015; Killengreen, Siw/G-9205-2016; Yoccoz, Nigel/C-8561-2014","Ehrich, Dorothee/0000-0002-3028-9488; Yoccoz, Nigel/0000-0003-2192-1039; Lecomte, Nicolas/0000-0002-8473-5375",Norwegian Directorate of Nature Management; Norwegian Research CouncilResearch Council of NorwayEuropean Commission,"We thank the field inspectors from the Norwegian Directorate of Nature Management, I.

We hypothesized that the presence of the shrubs Buxus sempervirens and Juniperus communis alter the rate and the pathway of the succession by facilitating the regeneration of Q. humilis. To infer the process of facilitation at a large scale, the spatial distribution of Q. humilis was studied in relation to acorn sources and the type of plant cover in grazed and ungrazed sites. Abundant recruitment up to 80 m from the wood margins and from isolated oak trees in grassland shows that acorns are dispersed effectively. At the three study sites, the density of Q. humilis individuals was higher under shrubs than in grassland, suggesting that facilitation may occur. This density difference was much higher in the grazed sites than in the ungrazed site. Moreover, before grazing by livestock, the distribution of first-year seedlings is independent of vegetation cover. Thus, shrubs improve Q. humilis regeneration by protecting individuals from grazing. The high density of individuals at the northern edge of shrubs suggests that a second facilitation mechanism may exist, probably related to improved germination conditions. Facilitation by shrubs appears to be very important for Q. humilis dynamics.","CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Lepart, J (corresponding author), CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.",,,,,,,55,81,86,1,30,OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB,UPPSALA,"BOX 25137, S 752 25 UPPSALA, SWEDEN",1100-9233,,,J VEG SCI,J.

Gravid females pay a large tribute to this intense male sexual activity in terms of reduced foraging efficiency. Previous observations have demonstrated that gravid females, when chased by a male, dilute male harassment by moving closer to other females to form shoals. They also approach other males to promote male competition, and when males differ in size, they preferentially target large males, whose harassment is less intense. In this study, we tested whether the modulation of females' social preferences in response to male harassment is innate or learned. We tested social preference in three groups of females that differed in experience of sexual harassment and in the factors affecting it. Females of the first group were reared without any sexual experience, and pregnancy was induced through artificial insemination. The second group was composed of naive females kept singly with a male; these females experienced sexual harassment but were prevented from experiencing the effects of male-male competition and shoaling on the amount of male sexual harassment. In the third group (controls), females were reared in multi-male, multi-female groups and could experience the modulating effects of social interactions on sexual harassment. When exposed to a harassing male, females of the three groups immediately reduced their distance from another female, approached a group of males or moved toward the larger of two available males. Moreover, the results for these three groups of females were similar to those obtained in wild-caught females that were tested in the same three tests in a previous study (Dadda et al. An. Behav., 70:463-471, 2005). This suggests that the strategies adopted by females in response to male sexual harassment do not need to be learned through specific experience of the social contexts.","[Dadda, Marco; Bisazza, Angelo] Univ Padua, Dept Gen Psychol, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Pilastro, Andrea] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, I-35131 Padua, Italy","Dadda, M (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Gen Psychol, Via Venezia 8, I-35131 Padua, Italy.",marco.dadda@unipd.it,"DADDA, Marco/ABI-7266-2020; Dadda, Marco/D-2417-2014","DADDA, Marco/0000-0001-7944-4058; Bisazza, Angelo/0000-0003-0209-7638; Pilastro, Andrea/0000-0001-9803-6308","MIURMinistry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR); University of Padova",We thank Jamie L.

Life-histories of individually identified males of an Asian colobine monkey, the Hanuman langur, were followed in order to understand mechanisms and functions of social processes associated with the formation of male bands, especially the degree of cooperation and competition among males. 2. The monkeys belonged to a geographically isolated population which is subject of a field-study in Rajasthan, India, spanning more than 15 years. The population consists of 27-29 one-male/multi-female troops ('harems'; average 39 members, home ranges up to 1.3 km(2)) and 12-14 all-male bands (average 12 members, moving ranges up to 20 km(2)). Females are highly philopatric, whereas males transfer from bisexual troops into male bands. Harem holder residencies average 27 months (range 3 days to more than 74 months). No male achieved residency in more than one troop, suggesting that residency is associated with a distinct peak in a given male's resource holding potential. The proportion of infants sired by extra-troop males is minimal. The dispersal pattern of langur males seem to reflect a long-lasting effort to achieve reproduction. This goal is tied to the necessity to rise through the ranks of a male band to the top of its dominance hierarchy, because only the highest ranking males can replace current harem holders during male band invasions into the home range of bisexual troops. 3. The age-class composition of seven male bands with a mean membership of 3-25 individuals was studied in detail. The longitudinal fluctuation in membership was less pronounced than the differences between bands. This reflects ecological conditions in the moving range of a given band which determine a ceiling in the number of members. The bands contained 27% juveniles, 23% subadults, 13% young adults, 30% prime adults and 9% old males. At any given time, in each band lived at least one individual who was of at least young adult age. Immatures often followed elder males during daily travels, but not vice versa. Younger males obviously benefit from the presence of older, more experienced bachelors, who know about the dangers and resources in an unfamiliar terrain. However, the formation of bands is also associated with increased food competition. But, older males tolerate younger because they likewise benefit from their presence through e.g. the dilution effect in case of attacks by predators and harem holders. Moreover, high ranking males might have a greater chance Co gain a harem residency when surrounded by many companions who function as buffers in agonistic interactions with other bands and harem holders. 4. Data on 157 demographic changes in male bands are presented. With regard to immigrants, 42% of the males transferred from their natal troop, 35% came from another male band, 5% joined after a solitary period, and 19% were ousted harem residents. For emigrations, the following number were found: 6% of the males transferred back into their natal troop, 36% transferred into another male band, 33% gained residency as a harem holder, and 24% died. 5. Male life histories are extremely variable. The whereabouts of males were tracked for up to 12 years. Most die before they reach adulthood, either in their natal troop or somewhere in its vicinity after they transfer into a band, Males who leave their natal troop are on average 2.5 years old (range 1.2 - about 6.6 years). Thereafter, most of them live succesively in several bands. Others do not change their band within a decade. Some males die in their prime adult or old age without having pained a harem residency. Those which become harem holders and are finally ousted may live solitarily, join their former or still another male band. Some males die soon once they are ousted, others live for years thereafter. 6. Demographic data on 58 females revealed that those who survive until adulthood will likely spent several decades in their natal troop until they die. But, because male mortality is high and male transfer frequent, it is not likely that a male will be a long-lasting member of the social unit he joins. For instance, two-thirds of all individuals changed residency in a given band, when they were still juveniles. Juvenile transfers can be related to the motivation to live with males of similar age. Similarly, only 30-50% of adult, young adult and subadult males were still members of the same band after two years. They probably try to increase their chance to gain a harem residency by taking the risk of frequent transfers. Old males were the least mobile. These individuals - usually ousted harem holders - aggregated in the relatively richest male band habitat. This, together with the fact that they tended to stay relatively long in the same band, reflects that they were at the end of their reproductive career. 7. Males may emigrate alone or with a cohort of paternal siblings, with or without their father. Maturing males emigrating from the same troop during successive years may join different bands. Because mortality is high and transfer frequent, it is unlikely that (half-)brothers survive together until maturity. The influence of kin-selection in structuring coalitions within bands seems thus to be rather low. This is probably one important reason for the fact that multi-male troops are extremely rare in the Jodhpur population.","UNIV JODHPUR, DEPT ZOOL, JODHPUR 342001, RAJASTHAN, INDIA; UNIV GOTTINGEN, INST ANTHROPOL, D-37073 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY",,,,,,,,41,21,26,0,24,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0005-7959,1568-539X,,BEHAVIOUR,Behaviour,MAR,1995,132,,3-4,,,,255,299,,10.1163/156853995X00739,,,45,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,QY330,WOS:A1995QY33000007,,,,,2021-09-27,

The brown stingray Dasyatis lata is a large benthic predator that inhabits the coastal waters of Hawaii. Although abundant in these ecosystems, little is known about its basic ecology. Stomach content, bulk and amino acid stable isotope analyses were used to assess diet and habitat use of juvenile brown stingrays and to examine the possibility of competitive interactions with juvenile scalloped hammerhead sharks Sphyrna lewini that are sympatric with brown stingrays in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu. Based on stomach contents, brown stingrays fed almost exclusively on crustaceans. An ontogenetic shift in stingray diet and an increase in relative trophic position (TP) were apparent from stomach content and stable isotope analysis. Stingray bulk delta C-13 and delta N-15 values indicated long-term foraging fidelity to subregions of the bay. Use of Kaneohe Bay as a nursery habitat was supported by nitrogen isotopic analysis of individual amino acids from stingray muscle samples. Our results clearly demonstrated that stingrays foraged within the bay for the majority of their juvenile lives then shifted to offshore habitats with the onset of sexual maturity. Trophic enrichment factors used to estimate TPs from amino acid analysis in previous studies may underestimate TPs in elasmobranchs owing to urea retention for osmoregulation. Potential prey resources were partitioned between stingrays and juvenile scalloped hammerhead sharks, and TP estimates from each analytical method indicated that juvenile scalloped hammerhead sharks forage on higher TP prey than do juvenile brown stingrays. These results show that the study of foraging ecology and habitat use of marine animals can greatly benefit from integrating traditional stomach content and bulk stable isotopic analyses with nitrogen isotopic analyses of individual amino acids.","[Dale, Jonathan J.; Holland, Kim N.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Dale, Jonathan J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wallsgrove, Natalie J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Popp, Brian N.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Geol & Geophys, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Dale, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.",jjdale@hawaii.edu,,"Popp, Brian/0000-0001-7021-5478","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE02-32016, OCE-0852301, OCE-1041329]; PADI Foundation [2010-3930]; Directorate For GeosciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1041329, 1040810] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This research was funded by National Science Foundation grants to K.

We provide a first field test of whether kleptoparasites reduce their personal foraging effort in situations where the frequency and rewards of kleptoparasitism increase. We provided experimental food patches for wild European blackbirds that varied in the distribution of prey and that had a potentially high rate of kleptoparasitism within pairs of blackbirds feeding in them. Although individuals differed in their rate of kleptoparasitism, they did not vary in the size of the reward that they gained from kleptoparasitism. As prey became more clumped, kleptoparasitism rate and its reward per incident increased on average. There was, however, no evidence that individuals that were kleptoparasitising more quickly and/or at a higher frequency had lower personal foraging effort. In contrast, foraging effort increased in both birds compared to when they were foraging alone, independent of dominance, kleptoparasitic opportunity or reward. Our evidence suggests that in some circumstances a kleptoparasite can detect kleptoparasitic opportunities without compromising its own personal foraging rate.","Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","Smith, RD (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Inst Biomed & Life Sci, Graham Kerr Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,"Cresswell, Will/B-1472-2013","Cresswell, Will/0000-0002-4684-7624",,,,22,15,15,0,2,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,COPENHAGEN,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",0030-1299,,,OIKOS,Oikos,MAY,2002,97,2,,,,,205,212,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970206.x,,,8,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,570VF,WOS:000176678800006,,,,,2021-09-27,

Cognitive processes often require simultaneous processing of multiple sources of information from environmental and social cues. However, little experimental data exist on how cognitive ability affects such fitness-associated aspects of behaviour. Using advanced tracking techniques, we studied mating behaviours of guppies artificially selected for divergence in relative brain size, with known differences in cognitive ability, when predation threat and sex ratio was varied. In females, we found a general increase in copulation behaviour in when the sex ratio was female biased, but only large-brained females responded with greater willingness to copulate under a low predation threat. In males, we found that small-brained individuals courted more intensively and displayed more aggressive behaviours than large-brained individuals. However, there were no differences in female response to males with different brain size. These results provide further evidence of a role for female brain size in optimal decision-making in a mating context. In addition, our results indicate that brain size may affect mating display skill in male guppies. We suggest that it is important to consider the association between brain size, cognitive ability and sexual behaviour when studying how morphological and behavioural traits evolve in wild populations.","[Corral-Lopez, Alberto; Kotrschal, Alexander; Buechel, Severine D.; Kolm, Niclas] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool Ethol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Corral-Lopez, Alberto] UCL, Div Biosci Genet Evolut & Environm, London, England; [Romensky, Maksym] Uppsala Univ, Dept Math, Uppsala, Sweden; [Romensky, Maksym] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, London, England; [Kotrschal, Alexander] Wageningen Univ, Behav Ecol Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands","Corral-Lopez, A (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool Ethol, Stockholm, Sweden.",alberto.corral@zoologi.su.se,"Romenskyy, Maksym/G-5654-2014","Romenskyy, Maksym/0000-0003-2565-4994; Kotrschal, Alexander/0000-0003-3473-1402; Kolm, Niclas/0000-0001-5791-336X; Corral Lopez, Alberto/0000-0001-7784-0209","VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council [2012-03624, 2016-03435]; Knut och Alice Wallenbergs StiftelseKnut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation [102 2013.0072]","Vetenskapsradet, Grant/Award Number: 2012-03624 and 2016-03435; Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse, Grant/Award Number: 102 2013.0072",,85,1,1,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1010-061X,1420-9101,,J EVOLUTION BIOL,J.

They have also made the underlying network infrastructure the backbone of contemporary life, which enables us to connect to global flows of information, people and goods. Unfortunately, hostile attacks on various network infrastructures by malicious predators have grown significantly over recent years. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach, STBoost, which is based on a self-training process and the standard boosting algorithm, for network intrusion detection. The approach has its unique features and can be used with a small set of labeled training data to build up initial models of normal and anomalous network activity behaviors, and then it employs additional unlabeled audit data to further refine the behavior models. We have conducted a number of experiments with the approach on the KDD Cup 99 data set and also compared it with another fuzziness based semi-supervised algorithm and several widely used supervised learning approaches. The experimental results have shown that the proposed semi-supervised approach represents a viable and competitive technique for detecting potential network intrusions.","[Jiang, Eric P.] Univ San Diego, 5998 Alcala Pk, San Diego, CA 92110 USA","Jiang, EP (corresponding author), Univ San Diego, 5998 Alcala Pk, San Diego, CA 92110 USA.",jiang@sandiego.edu,,,,,,26,1,1,0,2,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1872-4981,1875-8843,,INTELL DECIS TECHNOL,Intell.

We assessed the olfactory acuity of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) infected experimentally with the monogenean Dactylogyrus olfactorius, the adults of which live within the host's olfactory chambers. Olfactory acuity was compared between infected and uninfected hosts by assessing electro-olfactography (EOG) neural responses to chemical stimuli that indicate the presence of food (L-alanine) or the presence of conspecifics (taurocholic acid). We also compared differences in gross morphology of the olfactory epithelium in infected and uninfected minnows. Differences in EOG responses between infected and uninfected minnows to both cue types were non-significant at 30days post-exposure. By days 60 and 90, coincident with a two times increase in parasite intensity in the olfactory chambers, the EOG responses of infected minnows were 70-90% lower than controls. When infected fish were treated with a parasiticide (Prazipro), olfactory acuity returned to control levels by day 7 post-treatment. The observed reduction in olfactory acuity is best explained by the reduced density of cilia covering the olfactory chambers of infected fish, or by the concomitant increase in the density of mucous cells that cover the olfactory chambers. These morphological changes are likely due to the direct effects of attachment and feeding by individual worms or by indirect effects associated with host responses. Our results show that infection of a commonly occurring monogenean in fathead minnows reduces olfactory acuity. Parasite-induced interference with olfactory performance may reduce a fish's ability to detect, or respond to, chemical cues originating from food, predators, competitors or mates.","[Lari, Ebrahim; Goater, Cameron P.; Pyle, Greg G.] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Biol Sci, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada; [Cone, David K.] 83 Rhodenizer Lake Rd, Dayspring, NS B4V 5R7, Canada","Ebrahim, (corresponding author), Univ Lethbridge, Dept Biol Sci, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.",e.lari82@gmail.com,"Pyle, Greg/A-5281-2013; Lari, Ebrahim/B-4173-2016","Lari, Ebrahim/0000-0002-3623-877X; Pyle, Greg/0000-0003-4338-7674",Campus Alberta Innovates Program (CAIP) Research Chair in Aquatic Health,"The authors thank Douglas Bray and Grant Duke for their assistance with SEM imaging.

An effort to remove an alien beetle from Central Park in New York City, USA, resulted in widespread treatments of trees with the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid. Imidacloprid's systemic activity and mode of entry via roots or trunk injections reduce risk of environmental contamination and limit exposure of non-target organisms to pesticide residues. However, unexpected outbreaks of a formerly innocuous herbivore, Tetranychus schoenei (Acari: Tetranychidae), followed imidacloprid applications to elms in Central Park. This undesirable outcome necessitated an assessment of imidacloprid's impact on communities of arthropods, its effects on predators, and enhancement of the performance of T. schoenei. Methodology/Principal Findings: By sampling arthropods in elm canopies over three years in two locations, we document changes in the structure of communities following applications of imidacloprid. Differences in community structure were mostly attributable to increases in the abundance of T. schoenei on elms treated with imidacloprid. In laboratory experiments, predators of T. schoenei were poisoned through ingestion of prey exposed to imidacloprid. Imidacloprid's proclivity to elevate fecundity of T. schoenei also contributed to their elevated densities on treated elms. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first study to report the effects of pesticide applications on the arthropod communities in urban landscapes and demonstrate that imidacloprid increases spider mite fecundity through a plant-mediated mechanism. Laboratory experiments provide evidence that imidacloprid debilitates insect predators of spider mites suggesting that relaxation of top-down regulation combined with enhanced reproduction promoted a non-target herbivore to pest status. With global commerce accelerating the incidence of arthropod invasions, prophylactic applications of pesticides play a major role in eradication attempts. Widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides, however, can disrupt ecosystems tipping the ecological balance in favor of herbivores and creating pest outbreaks.","[Szczepaniec, Adrianna; Creary, Scott F.; Laskowski, Kate L.; Raupp, Michael J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Nyrop, Jan P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Szczepaniec, A (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",ada.s@tamu.edu,,"Laskowski, Kate/0000-0003-1523-9340; Szczepaniec, Adrianna/0000-0002-9603-4533",USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2005-35303-16269]; International Society of Arboriculture Tree Fund; Gahan and Bamford Fellowships,"This work was funded by the National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program of USDA 2005-35303-16269 and International Society of Arboriculture Tree Fund grants to M.J.R. and Gahan and Bamford Fellowships to A.S.

Grasshopper populations respond to interacting extrinsic and intrinsic factors, with yearly and decadal weather patterns and the timing of precipitation all potentially important. The effects of initial and increasing grasshopper densities on grasshopper survival and reproductive correlates were examined at a northern mixed-grass prairie site through manipulations of grasshopper densities inside 10-m(2) cages. High-quality grass growth occurred after a 9.1-cm mid-August rain. Reduced proportional survival was apparent in the two higher density treatments before the rain, indicative of food-limited density-dependent mortality. However, the large late summer rainfall event mediated the effects of exploitative competition on demographic characteristics because of the high-quality vegetation growth. This led to weaker effects of food limitation on survival and reproduction at the end of the experiment. The results indicate a direct link between weather variation, resource quality and grasshopper population dynamics led to a severe grasshopper outbreak and show that infrequent large precipitation events can have significant effects on population dynamics. Additional research is needed to examine the importance of infrequent large precipitation events on grasshopper population dynamics in grassland ecosystems.","USDA ARS, No Plains Agr Res Lab, Sidney, MT 59270 USA","Branson, DH (corresponding author), USDA ARS, No Plains Agr Res Lab, 1500 N Cent Ave, Sidney, MT 59270 USA.",dave.branson@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,63,35,42,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0046-225X,1938-2936,,ENVIRON ENTOMOL,Environ.

In essence, the models predict that increasing economic defendability of a resource should lead to increased frequency of aggression among competitors. We question this prediction because it is based on the assumption that individuals that do not possess a resource and must decide whether to attempt aggressive appropriation of another individual's resource face the same economic decision as those that already have possession of a resource and must decide whether to defend against an appropriator's attack. Using an evolutionary game analysis, we explore how changes in group size, clump density, patch richness, and predation hazards affect both the decision to appropriate and defend a resource and interact to predict effects on the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness of individuals. Our model predicts that increasing group size should result in a dome-shaped response of frequency of aggression and a slight decrease in aggressiveness. Increasing clump density is predicted to increase both the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness while increases in clump richness result in reduced aggressiveness at high richness values and a decelerated increase in the frequency of aggression. Finally, predation risk is predicted to increase the frequency of aggression only slightly but to lead to increases in aggressiveness. We compare these predictions to earlier resource defense models. We conclude that most experimental findings agree with our model's predictions but call for explicit experimental tests of our predictions concerning the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness.","Univ Quebec, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","Dubois, FD (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Pavillon Marie Victoria,90 Vincent Indy, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",frederique.dubois@umontreal.ca,,,,,,36,37,38,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9658,1939-9170,,ECOLOGY,Ecology,JAN,2005,86,1,,,,,3,11,,10.1890/04-0566,,,9,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,894KX,WOS:000226791700001,,,,,2021-09-27,

Experimental ecologists could also be divided into those who do not see any problems with sacrificing spatial and temporal scales in order to obtain replication, and those who understand that appropriate scale must always have priority over replication. If an experiment is conducted in a spatial or temporal scale, where the predictions of contesting hypotheses are convergent or ambiguous, no amount of technical impeccability can make the work instructive. Conversely, replication can always be obtained afterwards, by conducting more experiments with basically similar design in different areas and by using meta-analysis. This approach even reduces the sampling bias obtained if resources are allocated to a small number of well-replicated experiments. For a strict advocate of the hypothetico-deductive method, replication is unnecessary even as a matter of principle, unless the predicted response is so weak that random background noise is a plausible excuse for a discrepancy between predictions and results. By definition. a prediction is an 'all-statement'. referring to ail systems within a well-defined category. What applies to all must apply to any. Hence, choosing two systems and assigning them randomly to a treatment and a control is normally an adequate design for a deductive experiment, The strength of such experiments depends on the firmness of the predictions and their a priori probability of corroboration. Replication is but one of many ways of reducing this probability. Whether the experiment is replicated or not, inferential statistics should always be used, to enable the reader to judge how well the apparent patterns in samples reflect real patterns in statistical populations, The concept 'pseudoreplication' amounts to entirely unwarranted stigmatization of a reasonable way to test predictions referring to large-scale systems.","Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden","Oksanen, L (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",lauri.oksanen@eg.umu.se,,,,,,77,406,423,0,218,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUL,2001,94,1,,,,,27,38,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.11311.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,463NE,WOS:000170481600004,,,,,2021-09-27,

Previous work by our group has shown that P. clarkii can reduce populations of the molluscan intermediate hosts of human schistosomes through predatory and competitive interactions. Here, we investigate whether crayfish can reduce populations of Bulinus africanus and consequently, Schistosoma haematobium prevalence in school children. Children from 6 primary schools in the Machakos and Kitui Districts of Kenya were selected for study. Schools were divided into 3 experimental-control pairs. At experimental schools, crayfish were introduced into nearby aquatic habitats harboring Bulinus africanus snails and serving as S. haematobium transmission sites. Snail habitats near control schools did not receive crayfish. Six months after crayfish introduction, all infected children were treated with praziquantel. Children were then monitored quarterly for 2 years, at which time infection and reinfection rates were compared statistically between the paired schools. In one such pair, crayfish failed to establish, resulting in neither snail control nor a reduction in transmission. At the second pair of schools, the numbers of snails were decreased by the presence of crayfish, but a clear difference in infection rates in children could not be detected, primarily because drought conditions kept overall transmission rates low. At the third school pair, crayfish established well in experimental habitats, snail numbers decreased precipitously, and children at the experimental school were significantly less likely to acquire S. haematobium infections than children at the control school. Our results indicate that under certain environmental circumstances, P. clarkii exerts a significant impact on the transmission of human schistosomiasis in Kenya. Important questions remain regarding the impact of P. clarkii on Kenyan freshwater ecosystems, not the least of which is its potential to significantly influence the epidemiology of schistosomiasis in east Africa.","Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Biomed Sci Res Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya; Kenya Govt Med Res Ctr, Clin Res Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Biol Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Minist Hlth, Div Vector Borne Dis, Nairobi, Kenya","Loker, ES (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",,,,,,,29,44,49,0,15,AMER SOC TROP MED & HYGIENE,MCLEAN,"8000 WESTPARK DR, STE 130, MCLEAN, VA 22101 USA",0002-9637,1476-1645,,AM J TROP MED HYG,Am.

Experiments were conducted in heterotrophic microcosms to quantify how populations of micro- and meiofaunal organisms affect ammonia oxidation (nitrition) and nitrite oxidation (nitration) using apparent nitrition rate (ANiR) and apparent nitration rate (ANaR) as proxies. ANiR and ANaR were not related to ciliate density. Meiofauna had no effect on ANiR, but a significant relationship between ANaR and meiofaunal biomass was observed, which varied with the particulate organic nitrogen (PON) content of the sediment. The relationship was negative at low PON and positive at high PON. These results suggest a direct negative action by predation on nitrifying bacteria and an indirect positive action by reducing competitors through grazing of heterotroph bacteria. The negative effect of 1 g meiofauna.m(-2) at low PON (-20% of ANaR(0), i.e., ANaR without meiofauna) is much smaller than its positive effect at high PON (+172 to +571% of ANaR(0)).

Because evolutionary interactions between maternal plants and their progeny can affect resource allocation patterns among sibling offspring, we suggest that kin conflict as well as herbivore-plant interaction theories need to be considered to predict chemical defence allocation patterns. Optimal defence theory predicts that maternal plants should defend more heavily those offspring in which resources have been disproportionately invested. In contrast, kin conflict theory predicts that natural selection will favour genotypes that can compete successfully for maternal defences irrespective of their quality, even at the expense of the fitness of siblings and the maternal plant. Evidence for these defence patterns were evaluated by examining the allocation of furanocoumarins to seeds of the wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa, Apiaceae). Furanocoumarins are toxins that are localized within the oil tubes of the maternal tissues of seeds. We evaluated the role of offspring investment (endosperm mass) and seed genotype on furanocoumarin allocation by mating an array of pollen donors with pollen recipients. Furanocoumarins were found to be positively correlated with endosperm mass on one side of the seed, a result consistent with optimal defence theory; however, on the other side of the seed, furanocoumarin content was influenced by seed genotype and was unrelated to endosperm mass. These effects varied with maternal plant. Further experiments demonstrated that nearly 80% of furanocoumarin production occurs after pollination, when fertilization products are active. Although the amount of furanocoumarin influenced by the seed genotype is small relative to the total quantity in the seed, these furanocoumarins are the first line of defence against important predators, such as the parsnip webworm, Depressaria pastinacella (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae). We found that parsnip webworm larvae were able to discriminate among genotypes within an inflorescence. In line with previous studies, these results suggest that a genotype's ability to influence furanocoumarin defence may a?ect its probability of survival. We conclude that the distribution of defences among plant offspring in wild parsnip is probably influenced by competition among seed genotypes that conflicts with maternal optimal defence.","Univ Illinois, Dept Entomol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; ARS, USDA, Nematol Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA","Zangerl, AR (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Entomol, 320 Morrill Hall,505 S Goodwin, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",,,,,,,48,16,18,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,1573-8477,,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

Marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) populations in the Galapagos exhibit 10-fold differences in body mass between island populations. There is also strong sexual size dimorphism, with males being about twice as heavy as females. To understand the evolutionary processes shaping body size in marine iguanas, we analyzed the selection differentials on body size in two island populations (max. male mass 900 g in Genovesa, 3500 g in Santa Fe). Factors that usually confound any evolutionary analysis of body sizes-predation, interspecific food competition, reproductive role division-are ruled out for marine iguanas. We show that, above hatchlings, mortality rates increased with body size in both sexes to the same extent. This effect was independent of individual age. The largest animals (males) of each island were the first to die once environmental conditions deteriorated (e.g., during El Ninos). This sex-biased mortality was the result of sexual size dimorphism, but at the same time caused sexual size dimorphism to fluctuate. Mortality differed between seasons (selection differentials as low as -1.4) and acted on different absolute body sizes between islands. Both males and females did not cease growth when an optimal body size for survival was reached, as demonstrated by the fact that individual adult body size phenotypically increased in each population under favorable environmental conditions beyond naturally selected limits. But why did marine iguanas grow ''too large'' for survival Due to lek mating, sexual selection constantly favored large body size in males (selection differentials up to +0.77). Females only need to reach a body size sufficient to produce surviving offspring. Thereafter, large body size of females was less favored by fertility selection than large size in males. Resulting from these different selection pressures on male and female size, sexual size dimorphism was mechanistically caused by the fact that females matured at an earlier age and size than males, whereafter they constantly allocated resources into eggs, which slowed growth. The observed allometric increase in sexual size dimorphism is explained by the fact that the difference between these selective processes becomes larger as energy abundance in the environment increases. Because body size is generally highly heritable, these selective processes are expected to lead to genetic differences in body size between islands. We propose a common-garden experiment to determine the influence of genetic factors and phenotypic reaction norms of final body size.","UNIV BIELEFELD, DEPT ANIM BEHAV, D-33501 BIELEFELD, GERMANY; MAX PLANCK INST BEHAV PHYSIOL, ABT WICKLER, D-82319 SEEWIESEN, GERMANY",,,,,,,,106,149,152,1,114,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,JUN,1997,51,3,,,,,922,936,,10.2307/2411166,,,15,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,XM065,WOS:A1997XM06500024,28568579,Bronze,,,2021-09-27,

The hymenopteran parasitoid fraction was computed for arthropods caught in sticky traps on islands at two sites in the Bahamas. At Staniel, twenty islands were cross-classified by area (large, small) and distance (near, far). At Abaco, twenty-one islands were cross-classified by area (large, small) and lizard treatment (lizards occurring naturally and unmanipulated, lizards not occurring naturally but experimentally introduced, lizards not occurring naturally and unmanipulated). The parasitoid fraction was larger for large islands and larger for near islands wherever this could be tested. Range of variation was especially great at Staniel, from 0.13 (small-far) to 0.48 (large-near). Absolute number of parasitoids, the numerator of the parasitoid fraction, was larger for large islands at Abaco but not at Staniel; however, it was somewhat larger for near islands at Staniel. At Abaco, parasitoid fractions and absolute numbers were highest overall for islands having lizards naturally and lowest for islands not having lizards naturally; lizard-introduction islands were intermediate. A relative-attenuation hypothesis, in which parasitoids and other arthropods both diminish with decreasing immigration or increasing extinction but the former does so relatively more strongly, is partly supported by the Staniel distance and Abaco area data. Food-web-interaction hypotheses may explain the other results: a differential reduction of other arthropods compared to parasitoids on large islands fits the Staniel area data, and a negative effect of lizards on parasitoid predators fits the Abaco treatment data. However, a tendency for islands favorable for lizards to be favorable for parasitoids seems at least an equally plausible explanation for the latter result.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS,CTR POPULAT BIOL,DAVIS,CA 95616","SCHOENER, TW (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DIV BIOL SCI,EVOLUT & ECOL SECT,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.",,"Morrison, Lloyd W/A-8949-2013","Morrison, Lloyd W/0000-0002-9375-843X",,,,54,20,20,0,6,GAUTHIER-VILLARS,MONTROUGE,"DEPT UNIV PROFESSIONNEL REVUES SCIENTIFIQUES TECHNIQUE 11 RUE GOSSIN, F-92543 MONTROUGE, FRANCE",1146-609X,,,ACTA OECOL,Acta Oecol.-Int.

I found that other local populations of A. aperta in the vicinity of the riparian woodland habitat are prey-limited and exhibit an '' aridlands '' phenotype (high aggressiveness in competitive interactions over energy-based territories and a lack of discrimination among potential prey types). The riparian woodland population deviates from surrounding populations in the area in that prey are abundant and this population shows a mixture of ''aridlands'' and ''riparian'' (low aggressiveness towards conspecifics and discrimination of prey profitability) phenotypes. Electrophoretic analyses of population subdivision in the area indicate that significant levels of gene flow have occurred, at least, sometime in the past. Drift fence analyses of spider movement futher indicate that there is marked unidirectional movement of spiders each year from the more arid habitats into the riparian woodland.

The interesting problem here is that nestlings should be able to communicate their nutritional status to parents in ways that are less costly energetically and less likely to attract predators. Thus, conspicuous begging behaviour is thought to have evolved as a result of either competition among nestmates or the manipulation of their parents to provide more food than would otherwise be favoured by selection. We studied sibling competition for parental feedings in the American robin (Turdus migratorius). We demonstrate that the probability that an individual nestling received food was related to several indices of begging. When we experimentally prevented parents from feeding part of their brood, both the intensity of begging and the number of feedings subsequently received by food-deprived nestlings increased. Furthermore, the begging intensity of those nestlings that were not food-deprived also increased in response to the begging of their hungrier siblings.","QUEENS UNIV,DEPT BIOL,KINGSTON K7L 3N6,ONTARIO,CANADA",,,"Montgomerie, Robert D/C-6516-2008","Montgomerie, Robert D/0000-0003-4701-4525",,,,29,147,152,0,22,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0340-5443,,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Snow leopards occurred mainly in areas close to the core area of tahr distribution. Tahr was the staple (56.3 %) of snow leopards.

The main prey of snow leopards in Asia (bharal, marmots) were absent in our study area, forcing snow leopards to specialize on tahr.

The model contains 14 state variables, each with a differential equation describing sources and sinks of phosphorus. The state variables encompass piscivorous and omnivorous fish, zooplankton, phytoplankton, sediment and lake water. The model simulates densities of fish and phytoplankton adequately, both before and after biomanipulation, although the actual lake phytoplankton density varied more year-to-year compared to the model predictions. According to the model, a biomanipulation will cause an increase in zooplankton biomass. This prediction contradicts available field data from the lake which do not indicate any significant change in zooplankton biomass resulting from the performed biomanipulation. This discrepancy may partly be attributed to structural uncertainties in the model, related to the size structure of predators on zooplankton, i.e. the omnivorous fish community. The simulations suggest that phosphorus was routed along the pelagic food chain to a larger extent after omnivorous fish were removed, whereas the amount of phosphorus routed via the sediment and benthivorous fish decreased following fish removal. Accordingly, translocation of phosphorus from sediment to water by benthivorous fish is predicted to be substantially reduced by biomanipulation, resulting in an overall reduction in the release of new phosphorus to phytoplankton. Irrespective of simulated fishing effort (reduction of less than or equal to 0.5% d(-1) for two years), the model predicts that P-release from the sediment and the external load will remain sufficiently high to force the system back to its previous state within a decade. Thus, recurrent biomanipulations and/or combined abatement strategies may be necessary to maintain low phytoplankton density. Known structural model uncertainties may however affect the robustness of such detailed predictions about the system resilience.","Univ Lund, Inst Ecol, Dept Limnol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden; Ctr Chem & Chem Engn, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden","Persson, A (corresponding author), Univ Lund, Inst Ecol, Dept Limnol, Ecol Bldg, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.",,,"Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317",,,,45,7,7,0,8,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JUN,1999,404,,,,,,131,144,,10.1023/A:1003784832380,,,14,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,255ZV,WOS:000083700800016,,,,,2021-09-27,

This property is particularly clear in chaotic systems but is also important for the majority of ecological systems which are nonchaotic, and has direct implications for analyzing ecological time series and testing models against field data. Dennis et al. point out that a definition of chaos which we advocated allows a noise-dominated system to be classified as chaotic when its Lyapunov exponent lambda is positive, which misses what is really going on. As a solution, they propose to eliminate the concept of noise-induced chaos: chaos should retain its strictly deterministic definition'', hence ecological populations cannot be strictly chaotic. Instead, they suggest that ecologists ask whether ecological systems are strongly influenced by underlying skeletons with chaotic dynamics or whatever other dynamics - the skeleton being the hypothetical system that would result if all external and internal noise sources were eliminated. We agree with Dennis et al. about the problem - noise-dominated systems should not be called chaotic - but not the solution. Even when an estimated skeleton predicts a system's short term dynamics with extremely high accuracy, the skeleton's long term dynamics and attractor may be very different from those of the actual noisy system. Using theoretical models and empirical data on microtine rodent cycles and laboratory populations of Tribolium, we illustrate how data analyses focusing on attributes of the skeleton and its attractor - such as the deterministic Lyapunov exponent lambda(0) that Dennis et al. have used as their primary indicator of chaos - will frequently give misleading results. In contrast, quantitative measures of the actual noisy system, such as lambda, provide useful information for characterizing observed dynamics and for testing proposed mechanistic explanations.","Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA","Ellner, SP (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, E145 Corson Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",spe2@cornell.edu,,,,,,53,52,54,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,DEC,2005,111,3,,,,,620,631,,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2005.14129.x,,,12,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,984LQ,WOS:000233306800024,,,,,2021-09-27,
J,"VALLEE, G",,,,"VALLEE, G",,,THE LEGAL NATURE OF SENIORITY - A COMPARISON OF THE QUEBEC AND FRENCH SYSTEMS OF LABOR-LAW,RELATIONS INDUSTRIELLES-INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,,,French,Article,,,,,,,,"Seniority is not a new criterion, nor is it limited to contemporary labour law. However, modern-day labour law, along with collective bargaining, have helped to embed the concept of seniority in the organization of work in the private sector. The idea that the benefits obtained by a employee should increase with his or her length of service seems to be commonly accepted in different legal contexts. This common emphasis on seniority suggests that it might be interesting to consider the issue of its legal nature by looking beyond a single legal system. Are we always talking about the same thing when we base employees' rights on seniority, length of service or length of uninterrupted service? Is the concept of seniority understood similarly from one system to another? Are its foundations and effects the same? Our intention here is not to discuss the role of seniority in regulating the labour market or the appropriateness of using this criterion in managing workers, but rather to determine whether there are similarities from one legal system to another in the concept of seniority. The comparative method is used to explore this question. Without wishing to return to the ''universalist approach'' typical of comparative research in the early part of this century, we believe that certain ''principles'' can be found in the labour laws of different countries which might appear at first glance to have little in common. Our point of view here is that seniority, i.e. the recognition of continuous service, is one of these principles. Since we have chosen to study seniority as a point of convergence between different legal systems, we will compare the Quebec and French labour law systems which are highly dissimilar. While both systems are based on the same written private law, over the years labour law in the two jurisdictions has evolved into two vastly different models, which correspond closely to the main contemporary labour relations models. The first part of the paper reviews the literature on seniority in the systems studied. In some cases the literature concerns the roles played by seniority, which may be compared with the effects of passage of time in various branches of law and in traditional societies; in other cases it bears on the evolution of the concept of seniority, as related to the principal institutions in the two systems. North American literature defines seniority in terms of its role, either as a point beyond which the worker acquires certain rights and benefits (benefit seniority length of service), or as a criterion creating a hierarchy among workers (competitive status seniority). In France, the former of these two roles is by far the more important, both in law and in collective agreements. The two systems have also taken different approaches to calculating seniority, which raises questions as to its foundations. In North America, the legal foundations of seniority have been discussed in jurisprudence and in doctrine with reference to collective agreements, today the main pillar of the seniority concept. There are two opposing theories in this regard: the inherency theory, whereby rights relating to seniority exist outside the collective agreement, and the contractual basis theory, whereby seniority is a creatiln of the collective agreement. The latter approach has been applied by the courts in both Canada and the United States. In France, the dominant theory considers that seniority is based on the performance over time of the obligations under the individual contract of employment. Thus there is ''effective'' job seniority, which measures the performance over time of work, and seniority arising from the contractual bond, based on the length of the employment relationship. A minority approach, inspired by German labour relations doctrine, defines seniority as the length of time the employee has been with the enterprise, considered the central institution in the employment relationship. These dominant theories do not clearly establish the legal nature of seniority in labour law, at least when all its different manifestations are considered. This is the subject of the second part of this paper. Recognition of the employee's seniority is not limited to unionized institutions, and predates the institutionalization of collective bargaining. Employee seniority has long been a subjective criterion used by the courts in France and Quebec. In civil law, it is an aspect of theories that consider the employer's right to unilaterally terminate a work contract a relative right, subject to some control by the courts: the theory of reasonable notice, in Canada, and the theory of abuse of rights, in France. Another example of this use of seniority is the way in which the employee's seniority is seen as a criterion for attenuating discipline, in Canada, and as a mitigating factor in cases of serious fault and minor disciplinary infractions, in France. In Quebec, there have been debates in arbitral jurisprudence, before the regular courts and in doctrine, with regard to the use of seniority as a criterion for determining whether the economic grounds cited in support of terminating the employment relationship are the true cause of an employee being laid off, or whether it is simply a disguised dismissal. Seniority is then considered a determining factor in the criteria used by the employer in selecting which workers' positions are to be eliminated. Judges who use seniority in this way do not define the concept in detail, but refer to the usual criterion, the length of the employment relationship between the worker and employer, without taking into account any interruptions in the performance of work. Seniority then becomes a social value integrated into legal interpretation. The labour legislation of both the legal systems in question also makes seniority a condition for the acquistion of rights. In addition, in Quebec, it is interpreted by grievance arbitrators when the collective agreement bases entitlement to benefits on a vague definition of seniority. In these cases, seniority is a means of measuring the performance over time of the obligations of the employment relationship between an employer and employee. The individual contractual basis approach appears dominant, in both individual and collective work relationships, where the practices of different jurisdictions in the labour field to the existence of a form of ''common seniority law'' founded on the performance over time of the obligations of the individual work relationship and the length of the relationship with the employer rather than the length of time an employee has belonged to a bargaining unit. In some cases, the use of the concept of the enterprise means that the employee's seniority is maintained even if the enterprise changes hands. In both France and Quebec, seniority is connected to the individual characteristics of the employment relationship. The dual nature of work relations, attached in part to the contract of employment and in part to the enterprise/institution, appears to determine the legal nature of seniority in labour law. Recognition of seniority based on the length of the individual employment relationship does not take away the recognition of rights attached to seniority. Consequently, this notion of seniority is quite different from the inherency theory. The point is not to make the employee's seniority an inalienable individual right but rather to show that the calculation of seniority is related to the individual employment relationship and the implicit obligations of this relationship. Although this may be an individualistic view of seniority, it does not stem from a unilateral perspective, such as that of the inherency theory, nor from a perspective making it a right that could not be handled differently in the collective agreement. In the debate on the legal nature of seniority, there is room for an approach that recognizes both the fundamentally individualistic dimension of seniority and the role it plays in the organization of the community of employees through the collective agreement.",,"VALLEE, G (corresponding author), UNIV MONTREAL,ECOLE RELAT IND,MONTREAL,PQ H3C 3J7,CANADA.",,,,,,,69,1,1,0,7,PRESSES UNIV LAVAL,QUEBEC CITY,"C P 2447, QUEBEC CITY G1K 7R4, CANADA",0034-379X,,,RELAT IND-IND RELAT,Relat.

In contrast, we examined the influence of abiotic factors, particularly weather, light and tide, on the diving behaviour of thick-billed murre (Uria lomvia) foraging in the Canadian Low Arctic. We found little evidence that tide and weather influenced dive behaviour. As visual predators, light availability limits foraging opportunities; however, prey often surface at night so there may be a trade-off between increased food availability and reduced foraging ability during low-light conditions. Our data lent support to both ideas, as dive depth increased with light availability and the proportion of vertically migrating schooling prey was highest during sunup and sundown. There was no difference in dive depth between sexes outside the period of sundown; males, which forage at night, dove shallower than females in the late afternoon, which we suggest is because they specialize on shallow prey often caught at night. Apparently, adaptation for higher oxygen stores or lower oxygen consumption in deeper-diving females overrode any adaptation for improved vision in night-specialist males. We concluded that light availability interacted with prey vertical migration to impact underwater foraging abilities of breath-hold divers.","[Elliott, Kyle Hamish] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ, Canada; [Gaston, Anthony J.] Carleton Univ, Environm Canada, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada","Elliott, KH (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ, Canada.",kyle.elliott@mcgill.ca,"Elliott, Kyle/S-9185-2019",,NSERC Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship; ACUNS Garfield Weston Northern Studies scholarship; AINA Jennifer Robinson Scholarship,"We especially thank P.

Black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) are also widespread in western North America and are important ecosystem engineers, but they, have been reduced in extent because of human activity Here we report significantly greater numbers of camel spiders on black-tailed prairie dog colonies in southern New Mexico. The difference in vegetation structure created by prairie dog activity is likely the reason for the increased prevalence of camel spiders on colonies. Because camel spiders are important predators and prey, the observation that colonies support higher numbers of these animals provides a mechanism explaining differences in arthropod communities on and off colonies and explaining the preferential foraging behavior of vertebrates associated with prairie dog colonies.","[Duval, B.

Information on local foraging strategies is particularly important where carnivores might exploit alternate resources that could influence predator-prey interactions, carnivore population dynamics, and a variety of interactions at lower trophic levels. We used carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) values in serially sampled wolf (Canis lupus) vibrissae to quantify relative resource use and dietary variation among wolves (n = 115) from 4 areas in southwestern Alaska that differed in the availability of terrestrial and marine resources. Mean vibrissae isotope values varied by similar to 8% for delta C-13 and similar to 12% for delta N-15 and showed high levels of spatial, seasonal, and individual variation. While results showed that ungulates were the principal prey for wolves in all 4 areas, wolves also exploited a variety of alternate marine resources that represented an important component of wolf diets in some areas. Estimated dietary contributions from marine resources ranged from 28% to 56% among areas and use of these resources varied both spatially and seasonally. Dietary variation and use of marine resources increased from northeast to southwest along the Alaska Peninsula with increasing access to coastal areas and decreasing ungulate abundance. Seasonal shifts in resource use were also evident with dietary variation being highest during summer and fall when wolves consumed more alternate resources than during winter. Our findings suggest that use of marine resources and local variation in foraging strategies of wolves might, through a variety of pathways, have broad implications for the management of wolf-ungulate communities in southwestern Alaska.","[Watts, Dominique E.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Alaska Peninsula & Becharof Natl Wildlife Refuges, POB 277, King Salmon, AK 99613 USA; [Newsome, Seth D.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, 167 Castetter Hall,MSC03-2020, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Watts, DE (corresponding author), US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Alaska Peninsula & Becharof Natl Wildlife Refuges, POB 277, King Salmon, AK 99613 USA.",dom_watts@fws.gov,,,U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service; Alaska Department of Fish and Game,"We thank K.

We observed the dispersal of seeds by patches of smooth brome invading northern fescue prairies and applied an inverse power function model to explore its potential invasion patterns. Based on our observations of two northern fescue prairies in Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba, Canada, patterns of potential invasion were contingent upon the dispersal of seeds as individual florets or aggregated within spikelets and panicles. For example, although the majority of dispersed seeds were intercepted within one meter, inside and outside the margins of invading patches, slopes of the log-log plots of seed number against their dispersal distance were steeper for seeds dispersed as spikelets than individual florets. Despite the observed aggregation of seeds along the margins of invading patches, the number of dispersed seeds was poorly correlated with that germinated from the seed bank. The shallow dispersal gradient of individual florets and spikelets, combined with the steeper gradient of panicles suggest that smooth brome is capable of simultaneously invading along dense fronts and by establishing isolated foci. Although low correlations between the number of dispersed seeds and their recruitment from the seed bank might suggest postdispersal transport of seeds, other mechanisms, including seed predation and pathogens, remain unexplored. Conservation and restoration of northern fescue prairies must include efforts to control the dispersal of smooth brome seeds and reduce opportunities for their establishment.","[Otfinowski, Rafael; Kenkel, Norm C.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Van Acker, Rene C.] Univ Guelph, Dept Plant Agr, Guelph, ON N1G 2W, Canada","Otfinowski, R (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Biol Sci, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",umotfino@cc.umanitoba.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Parks Canada; Land Institute's Graduate Research Fellowship; University of Manitoba's Duff Roblin Graduate Fellowship,"The authors thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Parks Canada, the Land Institute's Graduate Research Fellowship and the University of Manitoba's Duff Roblin Graduate Fellowship for financial support for this project.

A remotely triggered camera trap was placed at encountered fresh cattle carcasses. Through this monitoring, two cases of infanticide were recorded. Both cases occurred in close proximity to a cattle carcass, a large prey item that may attract multiple jaguars-including females with cubs around age of weaning-and increase the risk of infanticide.

In addition, previous interactions within the community, such as herbivore-induced plant defensive responses, aggregation, and predator avoidance likely affect the assembly of arthropod communities on individual plants. We observed the phenology of arthropod communities and defensive plant traits on 100 milkweed (Asclepias eriocarpa) individuals at monthly intervals over a growing season. We experimentally wounded a subset of plants each month (April-August) to observe the effect of simulated added herbivore damage on the seasonal assembly of these arthropod communities. All plant traits and measures of arthropod communities changed over the season. The observed response to experimental leaf damage suggested a trend of induced susceptibility in early months, but not late months. Plants receiving early-season simulated herbivory experienced more subsequent leaf damage than unmanipulated plants. We observed several lagged correlations in our study indicating that blue milkweed beetle (Chrysochus cobaltinus) abundance was lower in months following high natural leaf damage, and that the abundance of a secondary omnivore (Lygaeus kalmii) and total predator abundance tended to follow months with high C. cobaltinus abundance. Ahistorical habitat factors determined much of the observed seasonality of arthropod communities, but induced responses to simulated herbivory also contributed historical effects that influenced arthropod community assembly.","[Pearse, Ian S.] US Geol Survey, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, 2150 Ctr Ave C, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [McMunn, Marshall; Yang, Louie H.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Pearse, I (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Ft Collins Sci Ctr, 2150 Ctr Ave C, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA.",ipearse@usgs.gov,,,National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [DEB-1253101],"We thank Vince Voegeli and the UC Natural Reserves system for access to Hastings Natural History Reserve.

To meet this demand, agricultural systems have intensified to produce more crops per unit area at the expense of greater inputs. Agricultural intensification, while yielding more crops, generally has detrimental impacts on biodiversity. However, intensified agricultural systems often have fewer pests than more environmentally-friendly systems, which is believed to be primarily due to extensive pesticide use on intensive farms. In turn, to be competitive, less-intensive agricultural systems must rely on biological control of pests. Biological pest control is a complex ecosystem service that is generally positively associated with biodiversity of natural enemy guilds. Yet, we still have a limited understanding of the relationships between biodiversity and biological control in agroecosystems, and the mechanisms underlying these relationships. Here, we review the effects of agricultural intensification on the diversity of natural enemy communities attacking arthropod pests and weeds. We next discuss how biodiversity of these communities impacts pest control, and the mechanisms underlying these effects. We focus in particular on novel conceptual issues such as relationships between richness, evenness, abundance, and pest control. Moreover, we discuss novel experimental approaches that can be used to explore the relationships between biodiversity and biological control in agroecosystems. In particular, we highlight new experimental frontiers regarding evenness, realistic manipulations of biodiversity, and functional and genetic diversity. Management shifts that aim to conserve diversity while suppressing both insect and weed pests will help growers to face future challenges. Moreover, a greater understanding of the interactions between diversity components, and the mechanisms underlying biodiversity effects, would improve efforts to strengthen biological control in agroecosystems.

On the basis of our measurements collected within a mid-Atlantic estuary over a 15-year period, we developed a globally testable empirical model of intertidal oyster-reef accretion. We show that previous estimates of vertical reef growth, based on radiocarbon dates and bathymetric maps(5,6), may be greater than one order of magnitude too slow. The intertidal reefs we studied should be able to keep up with any future accelerated rate of SLR (ref. 7) and may even benefit from the additional subaqueous space allowing extended vertical accretion.","[Rodriguez, Antonio B.; Fodrie, F.

Mature, virgin females from a single brood were mated with a single male. Results of generalized linear models indicate that the effect of the family on female fecundity and offspring growth was significant, which suggested that these traits are genetically determined to a certain extent. Larger females at the time of mating produced larger broods, although female body size at the time of parturition did not affect brood size, in contrast to the results of some previous studies in guppies. Brood size was negatively associated with the body size of neonates. Results highlighted significant associations between brood retention time and female fecundity as well as offspring growth. In addition, the interaction between the family and brood retention time was significantly associated with female fecundity and offspring growth. Females of some families had longer retention times of larger broods, whereas those of other families had shorter retention times of smaller broods. On the other hand, females with longer brood retention times produced smaller neonates with slower growth. Since the family also affected the brood retention time, selection may work against the duration of brood retention of females via the size, growth and number of offspring, depending on environmental factors such as the intensity of predation or competition in neonates.","[Karino, Kenji; Ikeuchi, Mari] Tokyo Gakugei Univ, Dept Biol, Tokyo 1848501, Japan","Karino, K (corresponding author), Tokyo Gakugei Univ, Dept Biol, Tokyo 1848501, Japan.",kkarino@u-gakugei.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [19570015]","We are grateful to the two reviewers for their valuable comments on early version of the manuscript, and to Aya Sato for the help with the experiments.

Stranded macroalgae exported from adjacent coastal ecosystems supports abundant intertidal consumers on oceanic sandy beaches, including talitrid amphipods, which can be one of the numerically dominant invertebrates of the upper shore. The allochthonous nature of this donor-controlled food subsidy and its unpredictable delivery by waves and currents, results in highly variable and potentially limiting resource availability for these consumers. In Chile, adults of the talitrid amphipod, Orchestoidea tuberculata Nicolet, can influence the survival of juvenile conspecifics through cannibalism, a type of intraspecific interaction we hypothesized could be affected by the availability of macroalgal resources. We experimentally investigated the potential influence of food availability on cannibalism between age classes in O. tuberculata in laboratory mesocosms. Juvenile mortality in presence of conspecific adults was significantly higher when juveniles and adults were maintained without food. However, adult mortality was neither density dependent or food dependent. Further, juveniles did not influence adult mortality, either with or without food. The strong effect of food limitation on juvenile mortality from cannibalism by adults of O. tuberculata found here, supports our hypothesis that food resource availability on beaches can affect this intraspecific interactions. In addition these results provide evidence of the potential importance of biological interaction in the population dynamics of intertidal consumers on oceanic sandy beaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

When given the option to join either a shy or a bold shoal of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, both shy and bold individuals showed a strong preference for associating with bold fish. Personality type interacted with individual hunger levels to affect the extent of association, suggesting important strategy variation by focal fish in a competitive foraging environment. Furthermore, shoals modified their behaviour in relation to the focal individual. Individual behavioural differences were shown to have a complex role in influencing association preferences as well as driving previously unrecognized behavioural modifications in foraging groups.

Although it provides obvious advantages, dispersal is often assumed to be costly. Selection is therefore likely to have acted to decrease these costs, and indeed several studies demonstrated that dispersers and philopatric individuals differ in their morphology, physiology and/or behavior. Using the common lizard (Lacerta viuipara) as our model system, we examined the contribution of phenotypic plasticity to the establishment of dispersal-dependent behavioral traits. We used a reciprocal transplant experiment in which conditions at the maternal site of origin, during offspring development in utero, and at the release site were manipulated. We then compared activity, social interactions and foraging behavior between individuals that stayed philopatric and those that dispersed. Most behavioral traits were also measured at birth and after the dispersal phase. This study demonstrates that (a) 10 months after the dispersal phase, there were still marked behavioral differences between dispersing and philopatric individuals, (b) the reaction when confronted to another individual was also dispersal-status dependent, a result which strongly suggests that individuals are able to recognize the dispersal status of same-age conspecifics and (c) none of the behavioral characteristics were found to be dependent on the environmental conditions (maternal and natal environment) indicating a lack of phenotypic plasticity in the building of the dispersal-dependent behavioral traits examined.

Individuals in the sediment (resident population) and those caught in bed-load (local-scale movement) and suspended-load (larger-scale movement) were counted, measured, and sexed, during two tidal cycles at 4-6 week intervals spanning 13 months. Gravid females and juveniles were present in the resident population on all sample dates suggesting near continuous reproduction. Juveniles (< 2.2 mm body length) accounted for 49.8% of individuals in the sediment, compared to 65.4% of those caught in the bed-load and suspended-load traps. For the majority of sample dates, there was a net export of juveniles from the estuary. The total number of juveniles captured in suspended-load traps was significantly greater during the ebb tide relative to the flood tide (n=541 versus 256), whereas no significant differences were found for adults. Similarly, numbers in the bed-load traps were significantly greater for juveniles during the ebb versus the flood tide (n = 900 versus 484), and also for adult females (n = 180 versus 86). Juvenile sex ratios were female biased in the sediment (9.8:1) and in suspended-load traps (7.6:1) and both were significantly more female-biased than that recorded for juveniles caught in bed-load traps (5.8:1). By contrast, there was a significantly lower proportion of adult females to adult males found in bed-load traps (1.7:1) and in suspended-load traps (0.98:1) compared to the resident population in the sediment (3.6:1). The mean size of juvenile females caught on a flood tide was significantly larger compared to those on the ebb tide, yet juvenile males were not significantly different, suggesting that smaller females were not returning on the flood tide. We suggest that female-biased juvenile dispersal for estuarine Paracorophium spp. lowers the risk of inbreeding and reduces competition. This may have evolved in response to a polygamous breeding system with little or no social organisation where a female produces more female offspring to maximise her inclusive fitness.

But, despite the numerous studies on interspecific trophic interactions, few studies have evaluated their feeding strategy, especially by experimental approaches. In this study, we determined, in the absence of both intra and interspecific competitive interactions, the feeding preferences of the freshwater grass shrimp Palaemonetes antennarius for the most common potential resources in its habitat. Plant and animal items were offered as food to each adult shrimp in multiple-choice laboratory experiments. Resource selection was determined under conditions of low and high food availability and related to the shrimp body size. The role of microbial colonisation in favouring detritivory was also investigated. Results of these experiments showed that P. antennarius consumed only animal items, mostly preferring the isopod Proasellus coxalis. In addition, palatability of the unselected plant remains and non-living prey was not improved by the microbial enrichment. Shrimps also resorted to cannibalism at low ration. By contrast, at high ration they specialised on a narrower range of resources, directing more their feeding efforts towards isopods. The preference ranking of the selected food types was inversely related to the average mass of the prey and varied with the shrimp body size. In particular, the number of live isopods in the diet increased exponentially with the shrimp mass at food high ration, which resulted not to be limiting. In conclusion, food availability influences the food niche of P. antennarius whose feeding strategy in the laboratory is facultative specialisation on dead and live animals rather than omnivory. Ease of handling and/or capture seems to play a role in the food preference ranking.","Univ Rome, Dept Genet & Mol Biol, I-00185 Rome, Italy","Costantini, ML (corresponding author), Univ Rome, Dept Genet & Mol Biol, Via Sardi 70, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",marialetizia.costantini@uniroma1.it,,"Costantini, Maria Letizia/0000-0001-6242-558X; ROSSI, LORETO/0000-0001-8014-5397",,,,37,11,12,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,JAN,2001,443,1-3,,,,,129,136,,10.1023/A:1017556406309,,,8,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,421LM,WOS:000168065900011,,,,,2021-09-27,

Ideal Free theory and the logic underlying it have recently been used to describe animal distributions over large landscapes and in doing so, these studies have not precisely met all of the assumptions of the IFD. Here, we use an individual-based simulation model of a population of generalized foragers to test the ability of the IFD to predict the equilibrium distribution of organisms in a large environment. Conditions of the model meet the assumptions of Ideal Free theory. Food abundance follows a fractal distribution spatially through the environment. Model foragers have a type II functional response and a marginal-value theorem type patch departure rule. Foragers may move through the environment without cost, and foraging does not affect food availability. In a simulation experiment, we manipulate the scale of heterogeneity in food distribution, the number of foragers in the population, the distance foragers move, and the scale of IFD predictions to determine the ability of the IFD to predict equilibrium spatial distribution of foragers. The experiment shows that correlations between IFD predictions and the distribution of simulated foragers were lower when food had a fractal distribution than when food resources had a random spatial distribution. IFD predictions best fit simulated forager distributions on fractal food landscapes when the scale at which distributions were measured was similar to the maximum movement distance of the foragers. Large differences between maximum movement distance and scale of measure resulted in low correlations between equilibrium distributions of simulated foragers and IFD predictions. These results indicate that the IFD is likely not a good predictor of animal distributions in large environments and that the extent of the area over which an IFD is used should be similar to the maximum daily movement of the animals under study.","OAK RIDGE NATL LAB, COMPUTAT PHYS & ENGN DIV, OAK RIDGE, TN 37831 USA","Tyler, JA (corresponding author), SUNY COLL BUFFALO, GREAT LAKES CTR, 1300 ELMWOOD AVE, BUFFALO, NY 14222 USA.",,,"Hargrove, William/0000-0002-9830-0022",,,,69,44,44,0,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0030-1299,1600-0706,,OIKOS,Oikos,JUN,1997,79,2,,,,,376,386,,10.2307/3546022,,,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WZ103,WOS:A1997WZ10300017,,,,,2021-09-27,

Typical of these are propagule size, propagule number, and age and size at maturity. What is largely missing from the study of life history evolution is consideration of the role of behavior, principally female oviposition site choice, in the evolution of life histories. For oviparous organisms, natural selection cannot produce locally optimized ''hard'' components of life history phenotypes without a consistent environmental context (whether invariant or variable); in a variable environment, that consistent environmental context can be most effectively provided by interactive oviposition site choice. I present a model of selection on oviposition site choice in the context of the evolution of ''hard'' components of life history phenotypes, along with some experimental data illustrating oviposition site choice in response to predators. The model and data are then related to the overall question of the role of oviposition site choice in life history evolution. The conclusion is that oviposition site choice must be under equally strong selection with egg size, egg number and the other hard components of life histories in order to generate and optimize locally adapted or ecologically specialized life history phenotypes, and must therefore, play a significant role in the evolution of life histories.","UNIV ILLINOIS, DEPT ECOL ETHOL & EVOLUT, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820 USA","Resetarits, WJ (corresponding author), ILLINOIS NAT HIST SURVEY, CTR AQUAT ECOL, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820 USA.",,,,,,,60,199,215,1,53,SOC INTEGRATIVE COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY,MCLEAN,"1313 DOLLEY MADISON BLVD, NO 402, MCLEAN, VA 22101 USA",0003-1569,,,AM ZOOL,Am.

These cues have been pinned down to several sources of settlement pheromones, one of which is a protein termed settlement-inducing protein complex (SIPC), a large glycoprotein acting as a pheromone to induce larval settlement and as an adhesive in surface exploration by the cyprids. Settlement assays in laboratory conditions with Amphibalanus (=Balanus) amphitrite cyprids in the presence of SIPC showed that cyprids exhibit settlement preference behaviour at lower concentrations of SIPC [half maximal effective concentration (EC50)=3.73 nmol l(-1)] and settlement avoidance behaviour at higher concentrations (EC50=101 nmol l(-1)). By using truncated fragments of SIPC in settlement assays, we identify that domains at the N-terminus of SIPC transduce settlement preference cues that mask the settlement avoidance cues transduced by domains at its C-terminus. Removing the N-terminal 600 amino acids from SIPC resulted in truncated fragments that transduced only settlement avoidance cues to the cyprids. From the sexual reproduction point of view, this bimodal response of bamacles to SIPC suggests that barnacles will settle gregariously when conspecific cues are sparse but will not settle if conspecific cues inform of overcrowding that will increase reproductive competition and diminish their reproductive chances.","[Kotsiri, Manto; Protopapa, Maria; Mouratidis, Sofoklis; Zachariadis, Michael; Vassilakos, Demetrios; Kleidas, Ioannis; Dedos, Skarlatos G.] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Biol, Athens 15784, Greece; [Zachariadis, Michael] Natl Ctr Sci Res Demokritos, Inst Biosci & Applicat, Athens 15310, Greece; [Samiotaki, Martina] Biomed Sci Res Ctr Alexander Fleming, Fleming 34, Vari 16672, Greece","Dedos, SG (corresponding author), Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Biol, Athens 15784, Greece.",sdedos@biol.uoa.gr,"Protopapa, Maria/AAL-9916-2021; Samiotaki, Martina/B-3851-2018; Dedos, Skarlatos G/A-5345-2008","Protopapa, Maria/0000-0002-9030-1469; Samiotaki, Martina/0000-0001-9952-0636; Dedos, Skarlatos G/0000-0002-0432-338X; Vassilakos, Demetris/0000-0003-2695-0795; Mouratidis, Sofoklis/0000-0002-0388-3369","National and Kapodistrian University of Athens [11240, GSRT-EPANII-11SYN-5-1274]; Greek General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT)Greek Ministry of Development-GSRT; European Social Fund (ESF)European Social Fund (ESF)",Research reported in this publication was supported from funds by the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens under award number Kapodistrias: 11240 and by the GSRT-EPANII-11SYN-5-1274 'Maripaints' research grant from the Greek General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT) and the European Social Fund (ESF).,,48,4,4,2,16,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

We investigated how age at release, size, and maturation status influenced the rate of residual production in hatchery summer-run steelhead released from the Winthrop National Fish Hatchery (Methow River, Washington) between 2010 and 2015. Migration data from 21,598 individuals implanted with PIT tags identified 1,783 residual steelhead expressing two distinct phenotypes: immature male and female parr; and precociously mature males. We found that age at release significantly affected the predominant residual phenotype. Age-1 steelhead residuals (S1 rearing strategy) were dominated by smaller parr of both sexes (fish FL), while age-2 residuals (S2 rearing strategy) were dominated by mature males, although both phenotypes were present in both S1 and S2 residual groups. Collections of residual steelhead in the Methow River indicated that parr phenotype residuals grew as well as natural-origin juvenile O. mykiss, suggesting potential competition for food resources and habitat. Detections of PIT tags within the Methow River basin indicated that precocious male residuals may overlap both spatially and temporally with previously documented spawning anadromous adults, posing a potential genetic management risk. Both residual phenotypes had poor overwinter survival, and only 1 of the 1,783 residual fish eventually returned to the Methow River as an anadromous adult. We conclude that the ecological and genetic consequences of residual steelhead far outweigh their potential contribution to anadromous production, and measures should be taken to reduce their production by changing hatchery rearing practices.","[Tatara, Christopher P.; Berejikian, Barry] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Environm & Fisheries Sci Div,Manchester Res Stn, POB 130, Manchester, WA 98353 USA; [Larsen, Donald A.; Swanson, Penny; Harstad, Deborah] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Environm & Fisheries Sci Div, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Cooper, Matt R.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Mid Columbia Fish & Wildlife Conservat Off, 7501 Icicle Rd, Leavenworth, WA 98826 USA; [Middleton, Mollie A.; Dickey, Jon T.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fisheries Sci, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr,NOAA, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Humling, Michael] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Mid Columbia Fish & Wildlife Conservat Off, Winthrop Field Off, 453A Twin Lakes Rd, Winthrop, WA 98862 USA; [Pasley, Chris R.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Winthrop Natl Fish Hatchery, 453A Twin Lakes Rd, Winthrop, WA 98862 USA","Tatara, CP (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Environm & Fisheries Sci Div,Manchester Res Stn, POB 130, Manchester, WA 98353 USA.",chris.p.tatara@noaa.gov,"Middleton, Mollie/Z-2446-2019; T/AAS-5925-2020","Harstad, Deborah/0000-0002-0267-6085",Bonneville Power Administration [1993-056-00],"We thank the USFWS staff at the WNFH and the Mid-Columbia Fish and Wildlife Conservation Office for their efforts in rearing the fish and for assistance in tagging, residual collections, and data collection.

This Review gives a brief overview of a number of skills that the fish need to secure prey with their shooting technique. Archerfish are opportunistic hunters and, even in the wild, shoot at artificial objects to determine whether these are rewarding. They can detect non-moving targets and use efficient search strategies with characteristics of human visual search. Their learning of how to engage targets can be remarkably efficient and can show impressive degrees of generalization, including learning from observation. In other cases, however, the fish seem unable to learn and it requires some understanding of the ecological and biophysical constraints to appreciate why. The act of shooting has turned out not to be of a simple all-or-none character. Rather, the fish adjust the volume of water fired according to target size and use fine adjustments in the timing of their mouth opening and closing manoeuvre to adjust the hydrodynamic stability of their jets to target distance. As soon as prey is dislodged and starts falling, the fish make rapid and yet sophisticated multi-dimensional decisions to secure their prey against many intraspecific and interspecific competitors. Although it is not known why and how archerfish evolved an ability to shoot in the first place, I suggest that the evolution of shooting has strongly pushed the co-evolution of diverse other skills that are needed to secure a catch.","[Schuster, Stefan] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Physiol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Schuster, S (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Dept Anim Physiol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",stefan.schuster@uni-bayreuth.de,,"Schuster, Stefan/0000-0002-0873-8996","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [Schu1470/1, Schu1470/3, Schu1470/6-11]","This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Schu1470/1, 3, 6-11).",,91,2,2,0,11,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

Recruitment plates were attached to the substrate at each site in all possible treatment combinations, including either presence of absence of macroalgal canopy, presence or absence of the herbivore, and presence or absence of a cage. Significant differences in recruitment were observed among sites in April and May, but not in June. The average number of recruits also varied significantly among herbivore treatments in May and June, and in the May macroalgae x herbivore interaction. Survivorship did not differ among sites, but did vary significantly among herbivore treatments. These differences were due almost entirely to consistently low recruitment and survival in the uncaged or open controls. Comparisons of the caged and open treatments explained between 88 and 99% of the variation in the respective main effects tests. The presence or absence of L. littorea or of macroalgal canopy had little effect on S. balanoides recruitment or survivorship. Results support previous conclusions that recruitment is greater on more exposed shores and suggest that exclusion cages may protect barnacle recruits from factors such as desiccation and the whiplash effect of macroalgal fronds.

As a result, we still lack a clear understanding of the level of mortality in natural populations and the role habitat may play in survival. We used long-term acoustic monitoring of neonate bull sharks Carcharhinus leucas in a south Florida estuary to determine mortality rates within this population. Estimates of natural, fishing and total mortality varied among the years examined, but not significantly, suggesting similar survival among years with the majority of individuals (77%) surviving beyond 18 mo. Compared with other juvenile sharks, mortality rates of C. leucas were low. The results indicate that the use of mesohaline estuarine habitats by C. leucas may provide benefits that are not present in more marine habitats where their counterparts reside. Use of estuarine regions may be a successful ecological strategy for improving survival because of reduced predation and competition.","[Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] Ctr Shark Res, Mote Marine Lab, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA; [Heupel, Michelle R.] James Cook Univ, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Fishing & Fisheries Res Ctr, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Heupel, MR (corresponding author), Ctr Shark Res, Mote Marine Lab, 1600 Ken Thompson Pkwy, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA.",m.heupel@aims.gov.au,"Nisa-Castro-Neto, Walter/L-3235-2014; Simpfendorfer, Colin A/G-9681-2011","Nisa-Castro-Neto, Walter/0000-0001-8389-5599; Simpfendorfer, Colin A/0000-0002-0295-2238; Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332","Mote Scientific Foundation, South Florida Water Management District; National Shark Research Consortium (NOAA Fisheries)National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","This research was funded in part by the Mote Scientific Foundation, South Florida Water Management District and the National Shark Research Consortium (NOAA Fisheries).

Environmental variables showed remarkable vertical stratification. Oxygen concentration was close to zero in the entire water column from night until sunrise, while the lower strata (from 20 cm below the surface) were close to anoxic during all three diel cycles. It proved to be the main determinant of the vertical distribution of microcrustaceans. Accordingly, the highest proportion of individuals was present in the surface layer. Chlorophyll-a concentration and phytoplankton biomass were inversely distributed compared to zooplankton. Microcrustaceans (mainly Daphnia curvirostris) migrated to the middle layer only in August, which could be explained by a trade-off between food resources, dissolved oxygen (DO) and competition with littoral zooplankters. The diurnal density patterns of microcrustaceans suggested horizontal migration into the aquatic macrophytes during night, which could be a strategy to avoid Chaoborus predation. Our results show that strong vertical gradients of abiotic and biotic factors occur even in such shallow waterbodies. Among them, DO can maintain constant vertical aggregation of zooplankters by limiting their occurrence to the surface layers.","[Vad, Csaba F.] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Doctoral Sch Environm Sci, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Vad, Csaba F.; Horvath, Zsofia] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Systemat Zool & Ecol, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Kiss, Keve T.; Toth, Bence; Acs, Eva] MTA Ctr Ecol Res, Danube Res Inst, H-2131 God, Hungary; [Pentek, Attila L.] Szent Istvan Univ, Doctoral Sch Biol Sci, H-2103 Godollo, Hungary","Vad, CF (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Doctoral Sch Environm Sci, Pazamany Peter Setany 1-A, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",vad.csaba@gmail.com,"Acs, Eva Dr./J-3252-2014; Vad, Csaba/C-4329-2013; Horvath, Zsofia/A-5516-2016","Vad, Csaba/0000-0003-4744-0698; Horvath, Zsofia/0000-0003-2857-1094",KTI-OTKAOrszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA) [CNK 80140],"The authors thank Csaba Decsov, Zsolt Vad, Csaba Eva and Ferenc Vad for their help during the field works, furthermore, Balazs Nemeth for conducting the radiation measurements and Boglarka Somogyi for related advice.

In Australia, myrmecochory is a common seed dispersal syndrome and in the majority of such systems, seeds are initially dispersed ballistically. We measured ballistic and myrmecochorous seed dispersal distances in relation to canopies of Adriana quadripartita (Euphorbiaceae) and used a simulation model to estimate the net dispersal curve. We also compared seed removal rates and ant abundances under, and Outside, plant canopies to examine how foraging patterns by ants may affect net dispersal. Overall ant abundance did not show a significant numerical response to seedfall: however, the abundance of the main seed dispersing ant, Rhytidoponera 'metallica' did. Despite this, seed removal rates did not differ significantly between canopy and open locations. Rhytidoponera 'metallica' account for 93% of observed seed dispersal events. On average, the ants dispersed seeds 1.54 in and in doing so, moved seed a mean radial distance of 0.76 m away from canopy edges. This contribution to net dispersal distance by ants is considerable since ballistic dispersal moved seeds a median distance of 7.5 cm. Our Simulation model indicated that the combination of ballistic and ant seed dispersal is expected to result in seeds being transported a median net radial dispersal distance of 1.05 m from the canopy edge. Thus in this system, all important function of diplochory may simply be to move a higher proportion of seeds from under the canopy of parent plants than is possible by ballistic dispersal alone. This 'dispersal-for-distance' may result in reduced parent-offspring competition or may increase the probability that seeds reach rare safe sites for germination and recruitment.

Visual predators can benefit from higher light levels to increase their activity, while prey may decrease their activity to avoid predation. The lower number of nocturnal seabirds observed on colonies during full moon nights has been mostly interpreted as a predation avoidance strategy. However, it is also possible that shearwaters take advantage of the moon's illumination to feed also at night, and stay at sea to forage during full moon nights. We used miniaturized GPS-loggers to obtain 179 tracks from 99 wedge-tailed shearwaters breeding in New Caledonia, to investigate moonlight effects on individual behavior. Lunar phase significantly predicted self-provisioning trip duration, with individuals performing longer trips around the full moon. However, this relationship was not significant during chick-provisioning trips when adults have to frequently return to the colony. Adults mostly returned to the colony during moonlit periods, refuting the predation avoidance theory. Tracked individuals showed an unexpectedly high amount of nocturnal foraging activity (28% of total activity), positively influenced by the presence of the moon. delta N-15 stable isotope values were significantly related to the percentage of nocturnal foraging, but with a weak relationship, impeding our ability to confirm that wedge-tailed shearwaters fed on different prey when foraging at night. This study suggests that reduced colony attendance around the full moon may be linked to greater at-sea foraging opportunities in distant oceanic areas than to increased predation risk on land.","[Ravache, Andreas; Bourgeois, Karen; Dromzee, Sylvain; Vidal, Eric] Aix Marseille Univ, IMBE, CNRS, IRD,Avignon Univ,Ctr IRD Noumea, BP A5, F-98848 Noumea, New Caledonia, France; [Ravache, Andreas; Thibault, Martin; Menkes, Christophe; Vidal, Eric] Univ La Reunion, Inst Rech Dev, Lab Excellence Labex CORAIL, UMR ENTROPIE,IRD,CNRS, BP A5, F-98848 Noumea, New Caledonia, France; [Ravache, Andreas; Letourneur, Yves] Univ New Caledonia ISEA, BP R4, F-98851 Noumea, New Caledonia, France; [Weimerskirch, Henri; de Grissac, Sophie; Prudor, Aurelien] CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, Paris, France; [Lorrain, Anne] Univ Brest, LEMAR, Ifremer, CNRS,IRD, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Allain, Valerie] SPC, Secretariat Pacific Community, BP D5, F-98848 Noumea, New Caledonia, France; [Bustamante, Paco] La Rochelle Univ, Littoral Environm & Soc LIENSs, UMR 7266, CNRS, 2 Rue Olympe Gouges, F-17000 La Rochelle, France; [Bustamante, Paco] IUF, 1 Rue Descartes, F-75005 Paris, France","Ravache, A (corresponding author), 101 Promenade Roger Laroque, F-98848 Noumea, New Caledonia, France.",andreas.ravache@ird.fr,"Bustamante, Paco/G-5833-2011; THIBAULT, Martin/J-5856-2019; LETOURNEUR, Yves/B-4387-2012; Allain, Valerie/AAE-1449-2019; ravache, andreas/AAN-1196-2020; Lorrain, Anne/A-4152-2009; Letourneur, Yves/V-6843-2019","Bustamante, Paco/0000-0003-3877-9390; THIBAULT, Martin/0000-0002-2386-4501; LETOURNEUR, Yves/0000-0003-3157-1976; Allain, Valerie/0000-0002-9874-3077; ravache, andreas/0000-0001-5413-3149; Lorrain, Anne/0000-0002-1289-2072; Letourneur, Yves/0000-0003-3157-1976; Bourgeois, Karen/0000-0003-1195-1015",European UnionEuropean Commission [1070-2015]; Province Nord [15C493]; Ecole Doctorale du Pacifique; Universite de la Nouvelle-Caledonie,This work was supported by the European Union BEST 2.0 project Biopelagos (grant number 1070-2015) and the Province Nord (grant number 15C493).

Focusing on the syntactic and especially semantic side, we suggest that these methods could help clarify five questions: (i) what morphology and syntax, if any, do monkey calls have? (ii) what is the 'lexical meaning' of individual calls? (iii) how are the meanings of individual calls combined? (iv) how do calls or call sequences compete with each other when several are appropriate in a given situation? (v) how did the form and meaning of calls evolve? We address these questions in five case studies pertaining to cercopithecines (Putty-nosed monkeys, Blue monkeys, and Campbell's monkeys), colobinae (Guereza monkeys and King Colobus monkeys), and New World monkeys (Titi monkeys). The morphology mostly involves simple calls, but in at least one case (Campbell's -oo) we find a root-suffix structure, possibly with a compositional semantics. The syntax is in all clear cases simple and finite-state. With respect to meaning, nearly all cases of call concatenation can be analyzed as conjunction. But a key question concerns the division of labor between semantics, pragmatics and the environmental context ('world' knowledge and context change). An apparent case of dialectal variation in the semantics (Campbell's krak) can arguably be analyzed away if one posits sufficiently powerful mechanisms of competition among calls, akin to scalar implicatures. An apparent case of non-compositionality (Putty-nosed pyow-hack sequences) can be analyzed away if one further posits a pragmatic principle of 'urgency', whereby threat-related calls must come early in sequences (another potential case of non-compositionality - Colobus snort-roar sequences - might justify assigning non-compositional meanings to complex calls, but results are tentative). Finally, rich Titi sequences in which two calls are re-arranged in complex ways so as to reflect information about both predator identity and location are argued not to involve a complex syntax/semantics interface, but rather a fine-grained interaction between simple call meanings and the environmental context. With respect to call evolution, we suggest that the remarkable preservation of call form and function over millions of years should make it possible to lay the groundwork for an evolutionary monkey linguistics, which we illustrate with cercopithecine booms, and with a comparative analysis of Blue monkey and Putty-nosed monkey repertoires. Throughout, we aim to compare possible theories rather than to fully adjudicate between them, and our claims are correspondingly modest. But we hope that our methods could lay the groundwork for a formal monkey linguistics combining data from primatology with formal techniques from linguistics (from which it does not follow that the calls under study share non-trivial properties, let alone an evolutionary history, with human language).","[Schlenker, Philippe; Kuhn, Jeremy] PSL Res Univ, Ecole Normale Super, Inst Jean Nicod, Dept Etud Cognit,EHESS,CNRS, 29 Rue Ulm, F-75011 Paris, France; [Schlenker, Philippe; Veselinovic, Dunja] NYU, Dept Linguist, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Chemla, Emmanuel] PSL Res Univ, Ecole Normale Super, Lab Sci Cognit & Psycholinguist, Dept Etud Cognit,EHESS,CNRS, 29 Rue Ulm, F-75011 Paris, France; [Schel, Anne M.] Univ Utrecht, Anim Ecol, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Fuller, James] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, New York, NY USA; [Fuller, James] New York Consortium Evolutionary Primatol NYCEP, New York, NY USA; [Fuller, James] CUNY, BCC, Bronx, NY USA; [Gautier, Jean-Pierre] Univ Rennes 1, Stn Biol Paimpont, CNRS, Rennes, France; [Arnold, Kate; Casar, Cristiane; Keenan, Sumir; Zuberbuhler, Klaus] Univ St Andrews, Sch Psychol & Neurosci, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Casar, Cristiane] Univ Fed Alfenas, Inst Ciencias Nat, Alfenas, Brazil; [Casar, Cristiane] Inst Pesquisa Bicho do Mato, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Lemasson, Alban] Univ Rennes 1, Ethol Anim & Humaine UMR 6552, CNRS, Stn Biol, Paimpont, France; [Ouattara, Karim] Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, Lab Zool & Anim Biol, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Ryder, Robin] PSL Res Univ, Univ Paris 09, Ctr Rech Math Decis, CNRS,UMR 7534, Paris, France; [Zuberbuhler, Klaus] Univ Neuchatel, Ctr Cognit Sci, Neuchatel, Switzerland","Schlenker, P (corresponding author), PSL Res Univ, Ecole Normale Super, Inst Jean Nicod, Dept Etud Cognit,EHESS,CNRS, 29 Rue Ulm, F-75011 Paris, France.; Schlenker, P (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Linguist, New York, NY 10012 USA.",philippe.schlenker@gmail.com,"Zuberbuhler, Klaus/A-9053-2011; Arnold, Kate/B-2021-2014","Zuberbuhler, Klaus/0000-0001-8378-088X; Arnold, Kate/0000-0002-5598-2174; Chemla, Emmanuel/0000-0002-8423-5880; Ryder, Robin/0000-0002-7467-0467",Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust; CAPES-BrazilCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); FAPEMIG-BrazilFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); S.B.

In theory, symbiotic crustaceans should display social monogamy with long-term heterosexual pairing when hosts are relatively small in body size and structurally simple, and when hosts have relatively low abundance in habitats where the risk of mortality for symbionts (e.g., predation) away from hosts is high. We test this prediction in the mating system of the flotsam crab (Planes major) and its facultative association with loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta). First, we found that the overall population and sex distributions were non-random and crabs inhabited host turtles as heterosexual pairs more frequently than expected by chance, which supports the hypothesis that P. major is socially monogamous on C. caretta. Second, we found that male crabs pair with females regardless of their reproductive state, male-female pairs do not display size-assortative pairing, crab body size and host turtle body size are not correlated, and crabs display reverse sexual dimorphism in body size and conventional sexual dimorphism in weaponry. These results do not support the hypothesis that social monogamy in P. major is always long term. Instead, our results suggest that the duration of social monogamy in P. major is likely variable and may involve some degree of host switching and intra-sexual (mostly male-male) competition. Our results were only partially consistent with theoretical considerations for how host characteristics and ecology affect the mating systems of symbiotic crustaceans, and future studies should focus on quantifying the degree and direction of host switching to better understand the factors that affect the duration of monogamous pairing when P. major associates with C. caretta.

During the early 1990s a decrease in acidic deposition resulted in slight improvement of water quality of the lake. This was followed by recovery of the reproduction of perch starting in 1991. A mark and recapture experiment in spring 1995 indicated a hundred fold increase in the population size of perch in a four year period. A decrease in the abundance of aquatic invertebrates was recorded during 1989-1996. This decrease well coincided with the recovery of the perch population, suggesting that increased predation by fish was responsible for the decrease. The occurrence of goldeneye young also dropped in L. Vaha Valkjarvi since 1993.

In separate behavioural trials, cannibalistic larvae were presented with two smaller conspecifics (a 'prey group'), matched for size, that were (1) siblings of the cannibal, (2) non-siblings and (3) one sibling and one non-sibling (i.e. a mixture of two sibling groups); larvae were allowed to consume only one conspecific during each trial. This experiment was repeated in 2 consecutive years with larvae from two different populations. In both years, significantly fewer cannibals ate a non-sibling from the mixed sibship group than from groups composed of two non-siblings. In contrast, the number of cannibals that ate a larva from the pure sibling prey group did not significantly differ from the number that ate their sibling from the mixed sibship prey group. Thus, small larvae were significantly more vulnerable to cannibalism by their siblings than by non-siblings. The availability of unrelated individuals as alternative prey did not deter cannibals from eating their siblings, even though cannibals readily consumed prey of either genotype when the alternative one was absent. This kinship-biased cannibalism apparently was not due to size-selective predation or to differences among sibships in their propensity to cannibalize siblings. Moreover, the behaviour of potential prey did not differ towards related versus unrelated cannibals during initial observations of larval interactions. Cannibals required similar amounts of time to capture and process both sibling and non-sibling prey. To our knowledge, our results provide the first evidence of sibling cannibalism when unrelated individuals are available as alternative prey.

Samples of sludge were taken from two domestic waste water treatment plants and were chemolithotrophically grown in recycling reactors. The experimental duration was typically in the order of hours. The maximal nitrification rates were estimated from the concentrations of nitrogen compounds in effluents. These rates could be easily determined by first order kinetics, since substrates were supplied in excess and growth was generally negligible. However, accumulation of nitrite affected the ammonia oxidation rates. At 3-5 mM nitrite these rates were halved as compared to 0-1 mM. Since the accumulated nitrite is continuously diluted without loss of sludge, recycling reactors are especially suitable to study nitrification. Subsequently, this method was applied to investigate the development of the maximal nitrification capacity as a function of the nitrogen load. For this purpose, sludge was subcultured with synthetic waste water in recycling reactors. Since heterotrophic ammonium assimilation was negligible, the final capacities were proportional to the nitrogen load. However, these capacities were lower than expected.

This paper presents models of constant continuous input in which this assumption is relaxed, so that predictions can be made about the standing crops of resources and the density relationship of prey mortality caused by the consumers. These models suggest that: (1) the input matching rule is not dependent on the assumption that resources are consumed immediately that they enter a patch, and holds whether or not there is interference competition but not when there is an alternative source of mortality; (2) exploitation competition is fundamental to the continuous input model. Whether or not interference competition occurs can be determined in experimental situations by measuring the standing crops of resources in patches with different resource input rates; (3) interference models are not an alternative to continuous input models but represent a 'snapshot' of time from either continuous input or depletion models; (4) in continuous input models prey mortality is density independent in the absence of interference because all patches have the same standing crop of resources.

We selected a reservoir with a large population of exclusively wintering great cormorants and seasonal changes in stored water volume to test the relative influence of abiotic and biotic factors on otter foraging ecology. DNA metabarcoding of otter spraints revealed a dietary change from autumn to winter. Otters had a diet dominated by the exotic goldfish in autumn, but predated intensively on the native northern straight-mouth nase in winter. This change was likely caused by predation of cormorants on goldfish and to fish biology. Secondly, macroscopic analysis of spraints revealed that otters shifted from a diet dominated by fish (in terms of biomass) to a diet dominated by red swamp crayfish during spring-summer, when the latter became overabundant. As revealed by modelling, this second shift was most likely influenced by the sudden increase in stored water volume in spring, but also by the cumulative effect of cormorant predation on fish during autumn-winter. Macroscopic analyses of otter spraints collected in a second reservoir with no cormorants revealed a lack of seasonality. Hence, the combined influence of both biotic and abiotic factors explained otter diet seasonality in a lentic-water novel ecosystem.","[Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro; Veloy, Carlos; Amboage, Moraima; Guitian-Caamano, Amanda; Vila, Marta] Univ A Coruna, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Campus Zapateira, La Coruna 15008, Spain; [Mari-Mena, Neus; Vizcaino, Anton; Vierna, Joaquin] AllGenet & Biol SL, Edificio CICA,Campus Elvina, La Coruna 15008, Spain; [Key, Charlie] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Menai Bridge LL59 5AB, Anglesey, Wales","Vila, M (corresponding author), Univ A Coruna, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Campus Zapateira, La Coruna 15008, Spain.",mvila@udc.es,"Vila, Marta/F-6118-2016; Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro/G-4522-2016","Vila, Marta/0000-0002-8803-9174; Martinez-Abrain, Alejandro/0000-0001-8009-4331","Xunta de GaliciaXunta de GaliciaEuropean Commission [GRC2014/050, ED431C 2018/57]; Universidade da Coruna","Fish samples to be used as positive controls for molecular analysis were kindly provided by Carlos Antunes, except for O. mykiss and Atlantic salmon S. salar that were purchased at a local fish market.

The resulting social structure then determines how individuals interact with their surroundings-resources and risks, pathogens and predators, competitors and cooperators. However, despite intensive research on (a) how individuals make social decisions and (b) how social structure shapes social processes (e.g. cooperation, competition and conflict), there are still few studies linking these two perspectives. These perspectives represent two halves of a feedback loop: individual behaviour scales up to define the social environment, and this environment, in turn, feeds back by shaping the selective agents that drive individual behaviour. We first review well-established research areas that have captured both elements of this feedback loop-host-pathogen dynamics and cultural transmission. We then highlight areas where social structure is well studied but the two perspectives remain largely disconnected. Finally, we synthesise existing research on 14 distinct research topics to identify new prospects where the interplay between social structure and social processes are likely to be important but remain largely unexplored. Our review shows that the inherent links between individuals' traits, their social decisions, social structure and social evolution, warrant more consideration. By mapping the existing and missing connections among many research areas, our review highlights where explicitly considering social structure and the individual-to-society feedbacks can reveal new dimensions to old questions in ecology and evolution.","[Cantor, Mauricio; Maldonado-Chaparro, Adriana A.; Brandl, Hanja B.; Carter, Gerald G.; He, Peng; Papageorgiou, Danai; Farine, Damien R.] Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Collect Behav, Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Cantor, Mauricio; Maldonado-Chaparro, Adriana A.; Brandl, Hanja B.; He, Peng; Klarevas-Irby, James A.; Ogino, Mina; Papageorgiou, Danai; Prox, Lea; Farine, Damien R.] Univ Konstanz, Dept Biol, Constance, Germany; [Cantor, Mauricio; Maldonado-Chaparro, Adriana A.; Brandl, Hanja B.; He, Peng; Klarevas-Irby, James A.; Ogino, Mina; Papageorgiou, Danai; Farine, Damien R.] Univ Konstanz, Ctr Adv Study Collect Behav, Constance, Germany; [Cantor, Mauricio] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Ecol & Zool, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Cantor, Mauricio] Univ Fed Parana, Ctr Estudos Mar, Pontal Do Parana, Parana, Brazil; [Beck, Kristina B.] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, Seewiesen, Germany; [Carter, Gerald G.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH USA; [Hillemann, Friederike] Univ Oxford, Edward Grey Inst Field Ornithol, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Klarevas-Irby, James A.] Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Migrat, Constance, Germany; [Prox, Lea] Univ Gottingen, Dept Sociobiol Anthropol, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach Inst Zool & Anthropol, Gottingen, Germany; [Prox, Lea] German Primate Ctr, Behav Ecol & Sociobiol Unit, Gottingen, Germany","Farine, DR (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Ecol Anim Soc, Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany.",dfarine@ab.mpg.de,"Farine, Damien R./Y-2454-2019; , Mauricio/E-6171-2012; Ogino, Mina/AAL-3792-2021; Hillemann, Friederike [freddy]/J-1370-2019; He, Peng/I-5221-2018","Farine, Damien R./0000-0003-2208-7613; , Mauricio/0000-0002-0019-5106; Ogino, Mina/0000-0002-3780-2942; Hillemann, Friederike [freddy]/0000-0002-8992-0676; Beck, Kristina/0000-0002-5027-0207; He, Peng/0000-0002-7176-701X; Papageorgiou, Danai/0000-0001-5535-6133; Carter, Gerald/0000-0001-6933-5501; Reis, AlessanRSS/0000-0001-8486-7469; Brandl, Hanja/0000-0001-6972-5403",Max-Planck-GesellschaftMax Planck Society; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [1654580]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel SuperiorCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [88881.170254/2018-01]; Deutscher Akademischer AustauschdienstDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); Alexander von Humboldt-StiftungAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [201706100183]; H2020 European Research Council [850859]; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FA 1420/4-1]; Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour [422037984],"Max-Planck-Gesellschaft; Natural Environment Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 1654580; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior, Grant/Award Number: 88881.170254/2018-01; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung; China Scholarship Council, Grant/Award Number: 201706100183; H2020 European Research Council, Grant/Award Number: 850859; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: FA 1420/4-1; Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour, Grant/Award Number: 422037984",,209,6,6,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,1365-2656,,J ANIM ECOL,J.

The majority of the population is in the Atlantic (> 80%), but population trends at Tristan da Cunha and Gough are uncertain. Early records indicate millions of penguins used to occur at Tristan da Cunha and Gough island. The most recent estimates indicate declines in excess of 90% for both Gough and the main island of Tristan that have occurred over at least 45 and 130 years, respectively. Numbers breeding at inaccessible and Nightingale islands (TDC) also may have declined since the 1970s, albeit modestly, whereas numbers on Tristan appear stable over the last few decades. Current population estimates are 32,000-65,000 pairs at Gough, 18-27,000 at Inaccessible, 19,500 at Nightingale, and 3,200-4,500 at Tristan. Numbers and trends at Middle Island (TDC) are unknown. Middle Island supported an estimated 100,000 pairs in 1973, and recent observations suggest this colony is being impacted by competition for space with recently recolonising Subantarctic Fur Seals Arctocephalus tropicalis. Past human exploitation and the impact of introduced predators may be responsible for the historical decline in numbers at Tristan, but these factors cannot explain the sharp decrease (since the 1950s) at Gough Island. Overall, declines at Gough, Tristan, Nightingale and Inaccessible islands indicate a three-generation decline of > 50%. Taken in combination with recent decreases in Indian Ocean populations, the Northern Rockhopper Penguins is now categorised as globally 'Endangered'. Determining the causal factors responsible for these recent declines is an urgent priority.","[Cuthbert, Richard; Hilton, Geoff M.; Sommer, Erica S.] Royal Soc Protect Birds, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, England; [Cooper, John] Univ Cape Town, Dept Zool, Anim Demog Unit, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Glass, Conrad J.] Edinburgh Seven Seas, Govt Tristan Cunha, Police Dept, Tristan Da Cunha TDCU 1ZZ, S Atlantic Ocea, England; [Glass, James P.; Glass, Simon; Glass, Trevor] Edinburgh Seven Seas, Govt Tristan Cunha, Agr & Nat Resources Dept, Tristan Da Cunha TDCU 1ZZ, S Atlantic Ocea, England; [Wanless, Ross M.; Ryan, Peter G.] Univ Cape Town, Percy FitzPatrick Inst, DST NRF Ctr, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Burle, Marie-Helene] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada","Cuthbert, R (corresponding author), Royal Soc Protect Birds, Sandy SG19 2DL, Beds, England.",richard.cuthbert@rspb.org.uk,"Hilton, Geoff M/H-3086-2017","Hilton, Geoff M/0000-0001-9062-3030; Ryan, Peter/0000-0002-3356-2056",United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office; Royal Society for the Protection of Birds; Percy FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology,"We thank the South African Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, the Tristan da Cunha Agriculture and Natural Resources Department and Ovenstones Agencies Pty Ltd for logistical Support, the University of Cape Town for assistance with field equipment and Support during writing, Andrea Angel for assistance with fieldwork in 2003, and Marthan Bester for information on fur seal populations.

The objectives were to authenticate yield decline on susceptible hybrids (2014 and 2015) and to measure aphid population growth and natural enemy prevalence on susceptible and resistant hybrids with similar genetic background (2014). Yield decline on susceptible hybrids (Tx 2752/Tx430 and DKS53-67) was more substantial when aphid population growth accelerated quickly and peaked above 300 aphids per leaf (50 to nearly 100% yield decline). Location and year variation in maximum aphid density and cumulative aphid-days was high, with doubling time values on the susceptible hybrids ranging between 3.9 and 7.9 d. On resistant Tx2752/Tx2783, leaf injury and yield decline were not seen or less severe than on its paired susceptible Tx2752/Tx430. Aphids declined on Tx2752/Tx2783 after initial colony establishment (Corpus Christi) or took about 60% longer to double in population size when compared with Tx2572/Tx430 (Winnsboro). The predominant natural enemy taxa were aphelinid mummies (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and sryphid flies (Diptera: Syrphidae), and they were more prevalent during flowering than prior to flowering. They were generally responsive to changes in aphid density of both susceptible and resistant hybrids, but variability points to need for further study. In future research, full season observations should continue as well as more detailed study of potential compatibility of sorghum resistance and biological control.","[Brewer, Michael J.; Bowling, Robert D.] Texas A&M AgriLife Res & Extens Ctr, Dept Entomol, 10345 State Highway 44, Corpus Christi, TX 78406 USA; [Gordy, John W.] Texas A&M AgriLife Extens, 1402 Band Rd,Suite 100, Rosenberg, TX 77471 USA; [Kerns, David L.] TAMU 2475, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Kerns, David L.] Louisiana State Univ, Agr Ctr, Winnsboro, LA USA; [Woolley, James B.] TAMU 2475, Dept Entomol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Rooney, William L.] TAMU 2474, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Brewer, MJ (corresponding author), Texas A&M AgriLife Res & Extens Ctr, Dept Entomol, 10345 State Highway 44, Corpus Christi, TX 78406 USA.",mjbrewer@ag.tamu.edu,,,"Texas Grain Sorghum Board; United Sorghum Checkoff Program; USDA-NIFA (Southern IPM Center enhancement grants program); USDA-NIFA (Crop protection and pest management competitive grants program, Applied research and development) [2014-70006-22528]","We thank the Texas Grain Sorghum Board, United Sorghum Checkoff Program, and USDA-NIFA (Southern IPM Center enhancement grants program and Crop protection and pest management competitive grants program, Applied research and development, 2014-70006-22528) for financial support and encouragement.

For example, changes in host food resources may affect multiple host traits (e.g., body size, behavior, immunocompetence), which may increase or decrease infection levels and the impact of parasites on host fitness. We often lack an understanding of which traits are most important for parasite transmission and fitness effects, posing challenges to predicting consequences of changing environmental conditions (e.g., eutrophication). Here, I examined the effects of food resources and host traits experimentally in a larval frog (Rana clamitans Latreille, 1801)-trematode parasite (Echinostoma revolutum Looss, 1899) system. I hypothesized that higher food resources reduce parasite infection and parasite effects on host growth and survival, due to increased host investment in parasite defenses, which I tested in a laboratory experiment. Contrary to my hypothesis, the results indicated that increased food levels enhanced infection in hosts, while the effect of parasites on survival did not depend on host food resources. A potential explanation for the positive effect of food level on infection was size-dependent infection rates (i.e., higher food levels increased infection through increased host growth), which is supported by a positive relationship between host body size and infection. These findings emphasize the complex relationship between host food resources and parasitism and the importance of environmental context and host traits (i.e., body size) in mediating interactions with parasites. The results also have relevance for conservation in light of rising anthropogenic impacts on aquatic systems and recent amphibian declines.","[Marino, John A., Jr.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 2019 Kraus Nat Sci Bldg,830 North Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 41809 USA; [Marino, John A., Jr.] Bradley Univ, Dept Biol, 101 Olin Hall,1501 W Bradley Ave, Peoria, IL 61625 USA","Marino, JA (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 2019 Kraus Nat Sci Bldg,830 North Univ Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 41809 USA.; Marino, JA (corresponding author), Bradley Univ, Dept Biol, 101 Olin Hall,1501 W Bradley Ave, Peoria, IL 61625 USA.",jamarino@umich.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 1110137]; University of Michigan Edwin S.

Female presence should increase the expression of male signal traits relevant for mate-choice, while male presence should promote the enhancement of traits involved in male-male competition. The electric fish Brachyhypopomus gauderio produces a biphasic electric pulse for electrolocation and communication. Pulse amplitude predicts the signaler's body size while pulse duration predicts circulating androgen levels. Males enhance pulse amplitude and duration when the numbers of males and females increase simultaneously. Here we tested the relative effects of female presence and male presence on male signal enhancement, and whether the size of the male competitor affected this enhancement. We found that male presence drives the enhancement of both pulse amplitude and second phase duration, independently of the size of the male competitor. Female presence induces the enhancement of pulse duration, but not pulse amplitude. These data suggest that males probably attend to information about a competitor's body size coded by pulse amplitude and attend to aggressiveness coded by a competitor's pulse duration, both potential predictors of fight outcome. Females may be primarily concerned about information on reproductive condition coded by pulse duration.","[Gavassa, Sat; Roach, James P.; Stoddard, Philip K.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA","Gavassa, S (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, OE 167, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",sgava001@fiu.edu,"Stoddard, Philip K/AAY-4188-2020","Roach, James P./0000-0002-1034-9615",FIU University Graduate School's Dissertation Evidence Acquisition Fellowship; Dissertation Year Fellowship; NIGMS MARC U*STAR fellowship; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS 0956603]; Division Of Integrative Organismal SystemsNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0956603] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T34GM008771] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We thank C.

Therefore, they play a role for the diversity in grazed ecosystems. While the importance of these keystone nurse shrubs is presently recognized, little is known about the factors controlling them. This knowledge is required to understand the functioning of grazed ecosystems and for sustainable management. We studied effects of cattle and rabbits on clonal expansion of Prunus spinosa in two ancient wood-pastures in the Netherlands. At each site we set up five blocks in grassland perpendicular to the edges of mature Prunus thickets, each block containing three herbivore treatments: (1) open-to-cattle-and-rabbits, (2) open to rabbits, cattle excluded, (3) cattle and rabbits excluded. We monitored the number and volume of Prunus ramets from 1998 to 2000 and again in 2003,3 years after exclosure-removal to restore grazing. For 1998-2000 ramet volume, but not ramet number, differed between treatments. Ramet volume was highest when both cattle and rabbits were excluded. Ramet volume did not differ between grazing by rabbits or cattle and rabbits combined, indicating that rabbits alone may be as effective in inhibiting clonal expansion as cattle and rabbits combined. Three years after exclosure-removal ramet number and volume had increased in all treatments. Number of ramets remained unaffected by (former) treatments. Ramet volume remained highest in the former cattle-plus-rabbits exclusion treatment, differing significantly from the 'open-to-cattle-and-rabbits' treatment. So, once successfully established during herbivore absence, further expansion is not prevented by cattle and rabbit grazing. This study shows that vertebrate herbivory controls the keystone nurse-shrub in wood-pastures: combined cattle and rabbit grazing, and notably rabbits alone, inhibit expansion. Temporary herbivore absence allows expansion of ramets, which persists after herbivore-reappearance. Sustainable management of wood-pastures should allow spatial-temporal fluctuations of herbivore densities, leading to increased vegetation structure and associated biodiversity.","[Smit, Christian] Univ Utrecht, Environm Sci Grp, Fac Geosci, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Bakker, Elisabeth S.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Aquat Ecol, NL-3631 AC Nieuwersluis, Netherlands; [Smit, Christian; Apol, M.

Aptian (Early Cretaceous) forms include nearly complete isocrinids which are found in extremely shallow environments represented by bioclastic carbonates and interspersed oyster-rich layers. Other Aptian occurrences come from more distal and deep environments and are composed solely of comatulids. Albian forms are dominated by cyrtocrinids and isocrinids associated with coral reefs. Late Cretaceous and Eocene crinoids include mostly bourgueticrinids (Comatulida) that are found either in outer ramp facies or associated with mid-ramp reef complexes. The later corresponds to one of the shallowest occurrence of bourgueticrinids in the Cenozoic. The palaeoecological data for fossil crinoids of northeast Spain contributes to reconstructing the history of the bathymetric distribution of articulate crinoids, supporting the idea that stalked crinoids were able to inhabit a wide range of shallow marine environments in the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic.","[Zamora, Samuel] Inst Geol & Minero Espana, C Manuel Lasala 44,9B, Zaragoza 50006, Spain; [Aurell, Marcos; Ferratges, Fernando A.] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Ciencias Tierra, Area Estratig, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain; [Veitch, Margaret; Saulsbury, James; Baumiller, Tomasz K.] Univ Michigan, Museum Paleontol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Veitch, Margaret; Saulsbury, James; Baumiller, Tomasz K.] Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lopez-Horgue, Mikel A.] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fac Sci & Technol, Estratig & Paleontol Saila, Leioa Biscay 48940, Basque Country, Spain; [Arz, Jose Antonio] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Ciencias Tierra, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain; [Arz, Jose Antonio] Univ Zaragoza, Inst Univ Invest Ciencias Ambientales Aragon, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain","Zamora, S (corresponding author), Inst Geol & Minero Espana, C Manuel Lasala 44,9B, Zaragoza 50006, Spain.",s.zamora@igme.es; maurell@unizar.es; maveitch@umich.edu; jgsauls@umich.edu; mikel.lopezhorgue@ehu.eus; nautilo_fer_1987@hotmail.com; josearz@unizar.es; tomaszb@umich.edu,"Aurell, Marcos/L-2059-2014","Aurell, Marcos/0000-0002-2430-7424; Saulsbury, James/0000-0002-5903-9220; Ferratges Kwekel, Fernando Ari/0000-0002-9532-6972","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2014-52096-P, CGL201787631, CGL2015-64422-P]; European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission; Ramon y Cajal GrantSpanish Government [RYC2012-10576]; Basque Government Research GroupBasque Government [IT-1044-16]; University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU Research Group [PPG17/05]; Government of AragonGobierno de Aragon [E18_17R]","We thank David Meyer (University of Cincinnati, USA) and anonymous reviewer for thorough and constructive comments that helped improve the manuscript.

These changes can affect the structure and function of biological communities and influence important climate-related feedbacks (for example, carbon (C) sequestration) in biogeochemical processing hot spots such as lakes. To understand how these ecosystems will respond in the future, this study examined recent (< 10 y) and long-term (1000 y) shifts in autotrophic production across paraglacial environmental gradients in SW Greenland. Contemporary lake temperatures and light levels increased with distance from the ice sheet, along with dissolved organic C (DOC) concentrations and total nitrogen:total phosphorus (TN:TP) ratios. Diatom production measured as biogenic silica accumulation rates (BSiARs) and diatom contribution to microbial communities declined across these gradients, while total production estimated using C accumulation rates and delta C-13 increased, indicating that autochthonous production and C burial are controlled by microbial competition and competitive displacement across physiochemical gradients in the region. Diatom production was generally low across lakes prior to the 1800's AD but has risen 1.5-3x above background levels starting between 1750 and 1880 AD. These increases predate contemporary regional warming by 115-250 years, and temperature stimulation of primary production was inconsistent with paleorecords for similar to 90% of the last millennium. Instead, primary production appeared to be more strongly related to N and P availability, which differs considerably across the region due to lake landscape position, glacial activity and degree of atmospheric nutrient deposition. These results suggest that biological responses to enhanced nutrient supply could serve as important negative feedbacks to global change.","[Prater, Clay; Bullard, Joanna E.; Martin, Sarah L.; Anderson, N.

As carnivores may function close to maximum sustained power outputs, decreased food availability or increased activity may render some populations energetically vulnerable. Prey theft may compromise energetic budgets of mesopredators, such as cheetahs and wild dogs, which are susceptible to competition from larger carnivores. We show that daily energy expenditure (DEE) of cheetahs was similar to size-based predictions and positively related to distance traveled. Theft at 25% only requires cheetahs to hunt for an extra 1.1 hour per day, increasing DEE by just 12%. Therefore, not all mesopredators are energetically constrained by direct competition. Other factors that increase DEE, such as those that increase travel, may be more important for population viability.","[Scantlebury, David M.; Marks, Nikki J.] Queens Univ Belfast, Inst Global Food Secur, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland; [Mills, Michael G.

Intrinsic determinates of animal movements are linked to physiological and life-history traits (e.g. sex, colony, experience), while extrinsic influences occur as the result of an animal's interactions with either other animals or the environment (e.g. prey availability, weather, competition). Knowledge of the factors affecting animal movements is critical to understand energetic bottlenecks and population dynamics. Here, we attempt to understand the interaction of some of these factors on the winter distributions of a surface-feeding seabird in the North Pacific. Between 2008 and 2011, we tracked 99 black-legged kittiwakes breeding at St. Paul and St. George in the Pribilof Islands, Alaska using geolocation loggers. We tested for colony and sex differences in winter distributions, and individual spatial fidelity over two consecutive winters of 17 individuals. Then we linked tracking data to associated environmental conditions as proxies of prey availability (e.g. sea surface temperature, mesoscale eddies, chlorophyll a, and wind) to understand their influence on kittiwake space use at an ocean basin scale. Results: Black-legged kittiwakes from both Pribilof Islands primarily wintered in pelagic sub-arctic waters, however, distributions spanned seven ecoregions of the North Pacific. There was a high degree of similarity in area use of birds from the two closely situated colonies and between sexes. Birds tracked for two consecutive years showed higher fidelity to wintering areas than occurred at random. Annual changes were apparent, as distributions were further north in 2009/10 than 2008/09 or 2010/11. This occurred because 70 % of birds remained in the Bering Sea in the fall of 2009, which corresponded with lower October sea surface temperatures than the other two years. Conclusions: Although individuals returned to wintering areas in consecutive years, our results suggest that under current conditions individual black-legged kittiwakes have a high capacity to alter winter distributions.","[Orben, Rachael A.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Long Marine Lab, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Orben, Rachael A.] Oregon State Univ, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Newport, OR 97365 USA; [Paredes, Rosana] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Roby, Daniel D.] Oregon State Univ, US Geol Survey, Oregon Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Irons, David B.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA; [Shaffer, Scott A.] San Jose State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Shaffer, Scott A.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Long Marine Lab, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","Orben, RA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Long Marine Lab, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.; Orben, RA (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Newport, OR 97365 USA.",raorben@gmail.com,"Shaffer, Scott A/D-5015-2009; Orben, Rachael A./H-9460-2019","Shaffer, Scott A/0000-0002-7751-5059; Orben, Rachael A./0000-0002-0802-407X",North Pacific Research Board (NPRB) project 911; project B63; UCSC Regents Fellowship; NPRB Graduate Fellowship; UCSC Chancellor's Dissertation Year Fellowship,"This research was approved by the animal care and use committee of the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) and by permit from the USFWS.

Combined with records of subfossil assemblages of cladocerans and chironomids, it may be possible to decipher whether changes are attributable to external forces or internally derived system shifts. A sediment record taken from the shallow (2.3m depth) Kings Billabong in the River Murray floodplain (Australia) was analysed to explore changes in trophic dynamics over the past century. The palaeoecological assessment revealed that littoral assemblages of cladocerans and benthic diatoms were gradually replaced by planktonic (planktonic and facultative planktonic) assemblages after river regulation in the 1920s. The stable isotopic composition of carbon (C-13), derived from chironomid head capsules, was relatively constant down-core, ranging between -26.1 and -24.0, and coincided largely with the C-13 of bulk sediment samples (-25.6 parts per thousand to -22.0 parts per thousand). The C-13 values of pelagic (Daphnia) and ubiquitous (Bosmina, Alona) cladocerans, however, varied markedly, with that for Daphnia between -29.8 parts per thousand (10-20cm) and -23.2 parts per thousand (60-70cm), and for ubiquitous cladocerans, between -29.4 parts per thousand (20-30cm) and -24.5 parts per thousand (80-70cm). The temporal changes in the C-13 values of cladocerans also suggest a gradual transition from a macrophyte-dominated state to a phytoplankton-dominated state after river regulation and further indicate changes in the horizontal migration behaviour of Daphnia depending on macrophyte abundance and predation risk. Our study demonstrates the potential of reconstructing, more precisely, the trophic dynamics of large river floodplain lakes and their ecological resilience by combining subfossil analyses with stable isotope analyses of selected subfossil groups.","[Kattel, Giri; Gell, Peter] Federat Univ Australia, Collaborat Res Network, Ballarat, Vic 3350, Australia; [Kattel, Giri; Gell, Peter; Grundell, Rosie; Weller, Sandra] Federat Univ Australia, Fac Sci & Technol, Ballarat, Vic, Australia; [Perga, Marie-Elodie] INRA, UMR CARRTEL 0042, Thonon Les Bains, France; [Jeppesen, Erik] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Silkeborg, Denmark; [Zawadzki, Atun; Barry, Linda] ANSTO, Inst Environm Res, Kirrawee Dc, NSW, Australia","Kattel, G (corresponding author), Federat Univ Australia, Collaborat Res Network, Ballarat, Vic 3350, Australia.",g.kattel@federation.edu.au,"Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019","Perga, Marie-Elodie/0000-0002-9003-0769; Gell, Peter/0000-0002-2251-5158; Weller, Sandra/0000-0003-4204-8582","AINSE (AINSEGRA) [11087]; Federation University Australia's CRN program [160186, 160157]; University of Savoie; MARS project (Managing Aquatic ecosystems and water Resources under multiple Stress) under the 7th EU Framework Programme, Theme 6 (Environment including Climate Change) [603378]; 'CLEAR' (a Villum Kann Rasmussen Centre of Excellence project); CRES; CIRCEEuropean Commission; CRN [160157]","The study was supported by funding from AINSE (AINSEGRA #11087) and the Federation University Australia's CRN program (#160186 & 160157) to GK and by a Visiting Professor Grant from the University of Savoie to MP to support GK's travel to France in 2013.

There is mounting interest in the potential covariation between these two behaviours within individuals, such that personality would influence mate choice. We experimentally tested this proposition under controlled laboratory conditions using male Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) as a model study system. We assayed repeatedly the mating preference of individual males for females based on their body size. Additionally, we assayed repeatedly two ecologically relevant personality traits in males, namely exploration of a novel environment and boldness under a simulated predation threat. Finally, we analysed whether male mating preference and personality traits were repeatable, and tested whether the personality of individual males was correlated (covaried) with their mating preference scores. Although all but one of the measures of exploration and boldness behaviour were repeatable over time, male mating preference scores were not repeatable. Measures of male exploration and boldness were not inter-correlated among individuals, suggesting the absence of a behavioural syndrome between exploration and boldness. Unexpectedly, males did not exhibit on average a significant mating preference for larger females over smaller ones; they chose randomly between the paired stimulus females. Overall, we found no compelling evidence for a relationship between individual personality traits and mating preference in male guppies, suggesting that personality does not predict mate choice, at least in our study population and under our experimental conditions. We discuss potential factors, other than male personality and body length, that might maintain inter-individual variation in male mating preferences in the guppy in the wild.","[Kniel, Nina; Godin, Jean-Guy J.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Kniel, Nina] Bielefeld Univ, Dept Anim Behav, Bielefeld, Germany","Kniel, N (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",nina.kniel@uni-bielefeld.de,,"Kniel, Nina/0000-0002-0858-3912",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [KN 1284/1-1]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [2015-04033],"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant/Award Number: KN 1284/1-1; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Grant/Award Number: 2015-04033",,88,1,1,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,NOV,2020,126,11,,,,,1019,1030,,10.1111/eth.13077,,JUL 2020,12,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,NW5HD,WOS:000545012300001,,,,,2021-09-27,

The two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae is characterised by a communal organization, in which silk production plays a key role. A silken web protects the colony against biotic and abiotic agents such as predators, competitors, humidity, wind, rain and acaricides. To evaluate the potential costs and benefits of being associated with genetically distant vs genetically close individuals in T. urticae, we assessed various fitness indicators (faecal pellet production, fecundity, death rate) in pure and mixed groups of two distinct populations of T. urticae: a red-form population from Tunisia and a green-form population from Belgium. If genetic origin had no influence, the values of fitness indicators in mixed groups composed of green and red individuals, would be intermediate between those of the pure green-form and red-form groups. Our results show that in a mixed group, faecal pellet production and death rate were statistically similar to the values obtained in the pure group of green-form individuals. Therefore, our study suggests that strain recognition ability may occur in T. urticae and that the genetic background of an individual may have a great impact on several of its life history traits.","[Le Goff, Guillaume Jean; Hance, Thierry; Mailleux, Anne-Catherine] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Biodivers Res Ctr, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Detrain, Claire; Deneubourg, Jean-Louis] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Ecol Sociale, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium","Le Goff, GJ (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Biodivers Res Ctr, 4-5 Pl Croix du Sud, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",guillaume.legoff@uclouvain.be,,,"FRIA (Fonds pour la Formation de la Recherche dans Industrie et l'Agriculture)Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; National Fund for Scientific Research (FNRS, Belgium) through the Fund for Fundamental and Collective Research (FRFC)Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS [2.4622.06]; IRSIB (Institut d'encouragement de la Recherche Scientifique et de l'Innovation de Bruxelles)","We are very grateful to Pr.

Such phenotypes may be fundamental to fisheries and aquaculture, yet there have been few detailed studies of this phenomenon in exploited marine animals. We investigated the behavioural and neuroendocrine responses of Atlantic cod (Gad us morhua L), to situations reflecting critical ecological challenges: predator attacks and territorial challenges. Both hatchery-reared and wild fish were tested and behavioural profiles were compared with baseline conditions. We then used an objective, multivariate approach, rather than assigning individuals along one-dimensional behavioural axes, to examine whether distinct behavioural phenotypes were present. Our results indicate that two distinct behavioural phenotypes were evident in fish from each background. In hatchery-reared fish, phenotypes displayed divergent locomotor activity, sheltering, brain monoamine concentrations and responses to competitive challenges. In wild fish, phenotypes were distinguished primarily by locomotor activity, sheltering and responsiveness to predator stimuli. Hatcheries presumably represent a more stressful social environment, and social behaviour and neuroendocrine responses were important in discerning behavioural phenotypes in hatchery fish, whereas antipredator responses were important in discerning phenotypes in wild fish that have previously encountered predators. In both fish types, behavioural and physiological traits that classified individuals into phenotypes were not the same as those that were correlated across situations These results highlight the multidimensionality of animal personalities, and that the processes that regulate one suite of behavioural traits may be very different to the processes that regulate other behaviours.

Relocating animals are expected to change their behavior to compensate for limited familiarity with the new home range and with neighboring conspecifics; such changes may indicate some of the costs of relocation. Little is known, however, about the magnitude and duration of the changes or about the types of behavior affected. We investigated the short-term (2 day) behavioral changes associated with relocation in the highly territorial longfin damselfish, Stegastes diencaeus. We compared the behavior of newcomers settling into experimentally created vacancies in an established neighborhood with that of the original residents of the same territories. The greatest difference was an increase in the rate of agonistic interactions. Newcomers also used smaller territories, moved more, and fed less. Neighboring damselfishes were less aggressive toward neighbors that expanded into vacant territories than toward strangers that relocated from elsewhere. The behavior of newcomers approached that of original residents within 2 days but territory size did not. These observations suggest that relocating a territory increases energy expenditure and decreases energy intake. Such costs could explain the philopatry of reef fish when alternative locations are of uncertain quality or are only slightly better. Nevertheless, they are unlikely to outweigh the long-term benefits of obtaining a superior territory-especially for individuals from adjacent territories.","McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada","Kramer, DL (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Doctor Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.",mcdougallpeter@gmail.com,"Kramer, Donald L/E-9058-2011",,,,,50,18,19,1,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1045-2249,1465-7279,,BEHAV ECOL,Behav.

Each agent makes probabilistic movement decisions in a gridworld through a linear combination of current perceptual information and a reinforcement history. EPICURE captures the empirical results from several foraging conditions in previous works, and it leads to a reevaluation of findings from those papers. In particular, human foragers show contingent usage of information, initially using social information to discover resource pools before private sampling information has been established. We describe a series of simulations that test the sources of resource undermatching often found in group foraging experiments. After testing the effects of foragers' starting locations, travel costs, the number of foragers, and the size of uniform food distributions, we discuss a novel hypothesis for undermatching. Spatial constraints lead to inadequate individual and group information sampling and cause group undermatching. The foraging group size, food rate, spatial distribution of food, and resulting forager reinforcement histories interact to produce undermatching, and occasionally overmatching, to resources.","Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Roberts, ME (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",robertsm@indiana.edu,,,,,,58,17,17,1,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1059-7123,1741-2633,,ADAPT BEHAV,Adapt.

Under good environmental conditions, the costs of kin-biased behaviour are likely to be low, and kin-biased behaviour may lead to better average performance of related than non-related individuals. However, under poor environmental conditions, individuals should maximise their own fitness, and costly altruistic behaviour should be disfavoured. Consequently, certain environmental conditions could select for kin-biased behaviour. We tested these predictions in a laboratory experiment with common frog (Rana temporaria) tadpoles. We reared full-sib, half-sib and non-kin tadpoles in good and poor environments (constant and decreasing water levels crossed across low and high densities) and recorded time to and size at metamorphosis, both important fitness components in amphibians. Tadpoles metamorphosed earlier and at smaller size at high density. The effects of relatedness on size at metamorphosis interacted with density: positive effects of relatedness were detected at low density, whereas at high density relatedness did not affect metamorph size. Water level treatment did not affect development time, but at low density tadpoles metamorphosed at smaller size in the decreasing water level treatment. There was no interaction between relatedness and water level treatments in any of the traits. Our results indicate that the effects of kinship on fitness-related traits are modified by environmental conditions. Moreover, in the case of R. temporaria tadpoles, interactions with relatedness and density seem to be stronger than interactions with desiccation risk.","Uppsala Univ, Evolut Biol Ctr, Dept Populat Biol, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden","Pakkasmaa, S (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolut Biol Ctr, Dept Populat Biol, Norbyvagen 18D, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.",anssi.laurita@ebc.uu.se,,,,,,55,13,17,0,7,FINNISH ZOOLOGICAL BOTANICAL PUBLISHING BOARD,UNIV HELSINKI,"P O BOX 26, FI-00014 UNIV HELSINKI, FINLAND",0003-455X,1797-2450,,ANN ZOOL FENN,Ann.

By offering equal foraging opportunities in both habitats and in both microhabitats, we assessed differences among habitats in the gerbil's perceived costs of foraging. By converting giving-up densities into quitting-harvest rates, we converted the diverse costs of foraging into a currency of energy. Quitting-harvest rates were higher in the open than bush microhabitat (owls are known to contribute a higher predation risk in the open microhabitat). Quitting-harvest rates increased sharply with distance into the rock habitat from the sand/rock habitat boundary. Quitting-harvest rates were low and constant with distance into the sand habitat. We believe that higher perceived predation risk in the rock habitat, perhaps as a result of few refuges for escaping predators, contributes to the high costs of foraging in the rock habitat and to the scarcity of gerbils in this habitat.","BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,DEPT BIOL,IL-84105 BEER SHEVA,ISRAEL; BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,BLAUSTEIN INST,MITRANI CTR DESERT ECOL,IL-84990 SEDE BOQER,ISRAEL","BROWN, JS (corresponding author), UNIV ILLINOIS,DEPT BIOL SCI,CHICAGO,IL 60680, USA.",,"Kotler, Burt P/F-1381-2012; Brown, Joel/J-2624-2012; ABRAMSKY, ZVIKA/F-1123-2012","Kotler, Burt P/0000-0003-2693-8788; ",,,,25,37,37,0,13,AMER SOC MAMMALOGISTS,PROVO,"BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIV, DEPT OF ZOOLOGY, PROVO, UT 84602",0022-2372,,,J MAMMAL,J.

Recently, mate choice studies have increasingly attended to the environmental circumstances affecting variation in choosers' behavior and choosers' traits. We reviewed the literature on phenotypic plasticity in mate choice with the goal of exploring whether phenotypic plasticity can be interpreted as individual flexibility in the context of the switch point theorem, SPT (Gowaty and Hubbell ). We found >3000 studies; 198 were empirical studies of within-sex phenotypic plasticity, and sixteen showed no evidence of mate choice plasticity. Most studies reported changes from choosy to indiscriminate behavior of subjects. Investigators attributed changes to one or more causes including operational sex ratio, adult sex ratio, potential reproductive rate, predation risk, disease risk, chooser's mating experience, chooser's age, chooser's condition, or chooser's resources. The studies together indicate that choosiness of potential mates is environmentally and socially labile, that is, induced - not fixed - in the choosy sex with results consistent with choosers' intrinsic characteristics or their ecological circumstances mattering more to mate choice than the traits of potential mates. We show that plasticity-associated variables factor into the simpler SPT variables. We propose that it is time to complete the move from questions about within-sex plasticity in the choosy sex to between- and within-individual flexibility in reproductive decision-making of both sexes simultaneously. Currently, unanswered empirical questions are about the force of alternative constraints and opportunities as inducers of individual flexibility in reproductive decision-making, and the ecological, social, and developmental sources of similarities and differences between individuals. To make progress, we need studies (1) of simultaneous and symmetric attention to individual mate preferences and subsequent behavior in both sexes, (2) controlled for within-individual variation in choice behavior as demography changes, and which (3) report effects on fitness from movement of individual's switch points.","[Ah-King, Malin] Uppsala Univ, Ctr Gender Res, Box 527, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Ah-King, Malin; Gowaty, Patricia Adair] Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Ah-King, Malin] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ethnol Hist Relig & Gender Studies, Univ Vagen 10 E, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Gowaty, Patricia Adair] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, DPO, Box 0948,AA 34002-9998, Washington, DC USA; [Gowaty, Patricia Adair] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Gowaty, PA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr South,Box 951606, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",gowaty@eeb.ucla.edu,,"Ah-King, Malin/0000-0001-7108-2275","Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, UCLA","Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, UCLA (Grant/Award Number: 'set-up-funds').",,240,39,39,0,98,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Acute tests were conducted in 24 impermeable enclosures in three temporary ponds. Total dissolved aluminum was higher in acidified enclosures in comparison with controls (pH 4.2, [Al] almost-equal-to 10-30-mu-M and pH >4.7, [Al] almost-equal-to 5-15-mu-M, respectively). Greater mortality of A. jeffersonianum occurred at pH 4.2 than at pH >4.7, whereas survival of A. maculatum and R. sylvatica were unaffected by pH. Mean wet masses of R. sylvatica were significantly lower at pH 4.2 than at pH >4.7, but mean wet masses of surviving A. jeffersonianum and A. maculatum were not influenced by pH. There were no pH-related differences in body sodium concentration in larval R. svlvatica. Chronic acidification of mesocosms to pH 4.2 ([Al] almost-equal-to 16-mu-M) (controls = pH >6, [Al] almost-equal-to 0.1-mu-M) resulted in total mortality of A. jeffersonianum. Survival of A. maculatum and R. sylvatica were not associated with pH, but survival of A. maculatum was low at both pH levels. Time to metamorphosis was longer for R. sylvatica maintained at pH 4.2, but not for A. maculatum. No differences in wet masses at metamorphosis were observed for R. svlvatica or A. maculatum. These results indicate that short and long term acidification of temporary wetlands could dramatically affect amphibians which rely upon them as breeding sites, either by causing mortality or by decreasing growth rates.","LAWRENCE BERKELEY LAB,BERKELEY,CA 94720","ROWE, CL (corresponding author), PENN STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL,208 MUELLER LAB,UNIV PK,PA 16802, USA.",,"Rowe, Christopher/D-5271-2012","Rowe, Christopher/0000-0001-9502-9225",,,,38,33,35,1,15,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0090-4341,,,ARCH ENVIRON CON TOX,Arch.

However, tests of this hypothesis usually use food-hoarding animals with a single load or a small load size. How multiple-load animals place their caches between food sources and nests remains largely unknown. Here, we hypothesized that multiple-load animals, compared to single-load animals, may not necessarily sequester food items but adopt alternative hoarding strategies due to their multiple-load ability. In this study, we presented seeds at different distances from the nests of the multiple-loading Siberian chipmunk, Tamias sibiricus, and mapped the spatial distribution of their caches in multiple-compartment enclosures to test our hypothesis that a multiple-prey loader will consistently establish caches near nests rather than rapidly sequester near the seed source. By using multiple-compartment enclosures with different distances between the seed source and nests, and given potential intra- and interspecific competition, we found chipmunks consistently placed their caches near nests but away from the seed source. Cache placement near nests may serve as an alternative strategy that not only guarantees a maximum harvest rate at the seed source but also ensures effective cache defence near nests. Moreover, scatter-hoarding seeds near nests may alternatively guarantee a food supply if larder-hoarded seeds are depleted or lost. Unlike seeds sequestered near food sources, caches near nests imply long dispersal distances for seeds in our study. Therefore, scatter hoarding by multiple-prey loaders is expected to be ecologically important for the structure and function of tree communities, especially in ecosystems in which seeds depend on food-hoarding animals for dispersal and germination.

Projected global changes urge the question how this interplay will be affected by browning (increasing input of terrestrial dissolved organic matter), nutrient enrichment and warming. We explored this with a process-based model of a shallow lake food web consisting of benthic and pelagic components (abiotic resources, primary producers, grazers, carnivores), and compared model expectations with the results of a browning and warming experiment in nutrient-poor ponds harboring a boreal lake community. Under low nutrient conditions, the model makes three major predictions. (a) Browning reduces light and increases nutrient supply; this decreases benthic and increases pelagic production, gradually shifting productivity from the benthic to the pelagic habitat. (b) Because of active habitat choice, fish exert top-down control on grazers and benefit primary producers primarily in the more productive of the two habitats. (c) Warming relaxes top-down control of grazers by fish and decreases primary producer biomass, but effects of warming are generally small compared to effects of browning and nutrient supply. Experimental results were consistent with most model predictions for browning: light penetration, benthic algal production, and zoobenthos biomass decreased, and pelagic nutrients and pelagic algal production increased with browning. Also consistent with expectations, warming had negative effects on benthic and pelagic algal biomass and weak effects on algal production and zoobenthos and zooplankton biomass. Inconsistent with expectations, browning had no effect on zooplankton and warming effects on fish depended on browning. The model is applicable also to nutrient-rich systems, and we propose that it is a useful tool for the exploration of the consequences of different climate change scenarios for productivity and food web dynamics in shallow lakes, the worldwide most common lake type.","[Vasconcelos, Francisco Rivera; Diehl, Sebastian; Rodriguez, Patricia; Hedstrom, Per; Karlsson, Jan; Bystroem, Paer] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden; [Vasconcelos, Francisco Rivera; Diehl, Sebastian] Umea Univ, Integrated Sci Lab, IceLab, Umea, Sweden; [Rodriguez, Patricia] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CADIC, Austral Ctr Sci Res, Ushuaia, Tierra Del Fueg, Argentina","Vasconcelos, FR (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden.",francisco.vasconcelos@umu.se,"Diehl, Sebastian/AAG-8952-2019; Diehl, Sebastian/B-2653-2013","Diehl, Sebastian/0000-0002-3860-5051; Rodriguez, Patricia/0000-0002-7134-8966; Rivera de Vasconcelos, Francisco/0000-0002-2327-9716","VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council [621-2011-3908, 621-2014-5238]; Knut och Alice Wallenbergs StiftelseKnut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation; ECOCHANGE; Kempestiftelserna","Vetenskapsradet, Grant/Award Number: 621-2011-3908, 621-2014-5238; Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse; ECOCHANGE; Kempestiftelserna",,64,16,16,3,116,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

So far most studies have focused on antiparasite defenses operating at the egg and chick stages and neglected defenses that may work prior to parasite egg deposition. Here, we experimentally explore the possibility that hosts, as part of a front-line defense, might minimize parasitism costs through informed nest site choice based on perceived risk of cuckoo parasitism. We conducted a large-scale manipulation of visual and auditory cues potentially informing on the risk of great spotted cuckoo Clamator glandarius parasitism during the nest site choice period of the magpie Pica pica host to investigate its effect on host's nest settlement and individual year to year site fidelity. Early breeding magpies preferentially placed their nests in safe areas (i.e., in sites of low perceived risk of parasitism), and, this effect diluted with time elapsed since risk of parasitism was manipulated. Site fidelity of individual magpies decreased with risk of cuckoo parasitism, for those that were not parasitized in the previous year. Our results constitute the first strong evidence showing that hosts can minimize the costs of cuckoo parasitism through informed nest-site choice, calling for future consideration of defenses potentially operating prior to parasite egg deposition to achieve a better understanding of cuckoo-host coevolution.","[Exposito-Granados, Monica; Parejo, Deseada; Aviles, Jesus M.] CSIC, EEZA, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Ctra Sacramento S-N, E-04120 Almeria, Spain; [Gabriel Martinez, Juan; Precioso, Marta; Molina-Morales, Mercedes] Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Avda Fuente Nueva S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Parejo, Deseada] Univ Extremadura, Dept Zool, Avda Elvas, E-06006 Badajoz, Spain","Exposito-Granados, M (corresponding author), CSIC, EEZA, Dept Funct & Evolutionary Ecol, Ctra Sacramento S-N, E-04120 Almeria, Spain.",moexposit@eeza.csic.es,"Parejo, Deseada/L-3953-2014; Aviles, Jesus/K-3332-2014; Molina-Morales, Mercedes/I-8397-2019; Martinez, Juan Gabriel/L-9471-2014; Exposito-Granados, Monica/K-1863-2019","Parejo, Deseada/0000-0002-7368-2378; Aviles, Jesus/0000-0002-1463-8393; Martinez, Juan Gabriel/0000-0001-5277-4620; Exposito-Granados, Monica/0000-0002-7996-2469; Molina Morales, Mercedes/0000-0001-8669-6624; Precioso, Marta/0000-0002-2030-5966","Spanish Ministry of Education and Science/FEDERSpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [CGL2011-27561/BOS, CGL2014-56769-P]; Government of Extremadura [TA13002]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2012-051898]",This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science/FEDER (Projects CGL2011-27561/BOS and CGL2014-56769-P to D.P. and J.M.A.).

Murphy's petrels Pterodroma ultima from Henderson Island (24 degrees 20S, 128 degrees 20W) in the South Pacific Ocean are highly vagile, and exhibit two distinct foraging trip types during incubation; similar proportions of birds undertake either looping trips around the South Pacific Gyre to waters off Peru (hereafter East) or trips south-west of the colony towards the Subtropical Front (South) (meanmaximum ranges of c. 3800 or 2000km from the colony, respectively). However, the relative benefits of the distinct trip types remain unclear. Through tracking birds with GPS and salt-water immersion loggers in 2015, the fine-scale foraging behaviour was examined for East (trip durations: 14.1-19.8 days, maximum ranges 2387-4823km) and South trips (12.9-25.8 days, 1565-1991km). Data on behaviour classified from GPS tracks, the number of wet bouts per hour (a proxy for landing rates) and wind speeds, were used to distinguish two distinct foraging modes: birds on East trips spent more time in directed movement, whereas those on South trips spent a greater proportion of time in area-restricted search (ARS) behaviour. East trips were associated with higher overall mass gain, and wet bouts occurred in equal proportions during directed movement and ARS behaviour. This suggests that in unproductive marine environments, it may be more profitable to maximise area covered to increase the chances of encountering prey. Analysis of lower-resolution geolocator data (collected from 2011 to 2014) indicated that individuals were largely consistent in trip type between years. Since birds that conducted East trips were 19% lighter on departure from the colony and experienced more frequent tailwinds on foraging trips, we speculate that these birds may benefit from reduced movement costs, whilst also experiencing reduced competition for foraging opportunities.","[Clay, Thomas A.; Phillips, Richard A.] British Antarctic Survey, Nat Environm Res Council, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Clay, Thomas A.; Brooke, M. de L.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Clay, Thomas A.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England; [Oppel, Steffen; Lavers, Jennifer L.] Royal Soc Protect Birds, RSPB Ctr Conservat Sci, David Attenborough Bldg,Pembroke St, Cambridge CB2 3EZ, England; [Lavers, Jennifer L.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, 20 Castray Esplanade, Hobart, Tas 7004, Australia","Clay, TA (corresponding author), British Antarctic Survey, Nat Environm Res Council, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.; Clay, TA (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England.; Clay, TA (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England.",tommy.clay@outlook.com,"Clay, Tommy/W-4867-2019; Oppel, Steffen/H-2771-2019; Lavers, Jennifer/O-4831-2017","Clay, Tommy/0000-0002-0644-6105; Oppel, Steffen/0000-0002-8220-3789; Lavers, Jennifer/0000-0001-7596-6588","David and Lucile Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; Darwin Plus: Overseas Territories Environment and Climate Fund; Sir Peter Scott Commemorative Expedition to the Pitcairn Islands; RSPB, the UK partner in Birdlife International; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/J021083/1]","We thank the Government of the Pitcairn Islands for permission to work on Henderson Island, L.

One explanation for this island rule is that shifts in morphology are an adaptation to facilitate ecological niche expansion. In insular passerines, for instance, increased bill size may facilitate generalist foraging because it allows access to a broader range of feeding niches. Here we use morphologically and ecologically divergent races of white-eyes (Zosteropidae) to test three predictions of this explanation: (1) island populations show a wider feeding niche than mainland populations; (2) island-dwelling populations are made up of individual generalists; and (3) within insular populations there is a positive association between size and degree of foraging generalism. Our results provide only partial support for the traditional explanation. In agreement with the core prediction, island populations of white-eye do consistently display a wider feeding niche than comparative mainland populations. However, observations of individually marked birds reveal that island-dwelling individuals are actually more specialized than expected by chance. Additionally, neither large body size nor large bill size are associated with generalist foraging behavior per se. These latter results remained consistent whether we base our tests on natural foraging behavior or on observations at an experimental tree, and whether we use data from single or multiple cohorts. Taken together, our results suggest that generalist foraging and niche expansion are not the full explanation for morphological shifts in island-dwelling white-eyes. Hence, we review briefly five alternative explanations for morphological divergence in insular populations: environmental determination of morphology, reduced predation pressure, physiological optimization, limited dispersal, and intraspecific dominance.","Univ Queensland, Dept Zool & Entomol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Biol Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; Natl Environm Res Council, Ctr Populat Biol, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Scott, SN (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Dept Zool & Entomol, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",i.owens@imperial.ac.uk,"Blomberg, Simone P/B-7613-2008; Clegg, Sonya/F-5504-2015; Clegg, Sonya M/A-8011-2013; Owens, Ian PF/F-1392-2010","Blomberg, Simone P/0000-0003-1062-0839; Clegg, Sonya/0000-0002-3092-3864; Owens, Ian/0000-0001-6080-3321",,,,70,69,73,0,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0014-3820,1558-5646,,EVOLUTION,Evolution,SEP,2003,57,9,,,,,2147,2156,,,,,10,Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity,727TB,WOS:000185674500016,14575334,,,,2021-09-27,

We explore the possibility that spatial or temporal heterogeneity in environmental signalling conditions (in this case light spectrum) may induce fluctuating sexual selection on male behaviour and ornamentation in guppies. We used shade cloth and filters to experimentally manipulate light spectrum, mimicking conditions found naturally: early morning/late afternoon light (SC treatment), midday forest shade (F89 filter treatment) and midday woodland shade (F55 filter treatment). Females were more responsive to male courtship and males were less likely to attempt sneak copulations under F55 light than the other two treatments. By contrast, male display rate was not influenced by treatment. Females tended to prefer the same males under SC and F55 light, but attractiveness in these treatments was unrelated to attractiveness under F89 light. There were similarities among treatments in the traits that females preferred: females preferred males with larger areas of orange in all three treatments. There were, however, also some differences, including preference for larger males under F89 light and for smaller males under the other treatments. Overall, the influence of ambient light spectrum on the relative importance of mate choice and male sneak copulation may have important implications for the mode and strength of sexual selection in different environments. The findings on attractiveness and preference functions, however, suggest that light spectrum only weakly affects the direction of sexual selection by female choice.","Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; James Cook Univ N Queensland, Dept Zool & Trop Ecol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Brooks, R (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",rob.brooks@unsw.edu.au,"Lindholm, Anna K/E-5207-2012; Brooks, Robert/A-1251-2008; Endler, John A/B-6659-2009","Lindholm, Anna K/0000-0001-8460-9769; Brooks, Robert/0000-0001-6926-0781; Endler, John A/0000-0002-7557-7627",,,,42,92,95,0,92,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,1461-0248,,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

We created populations with three different size structures in experimental lakes: age-0 and larger-bodied conspecifics, age-0 only, and an initially age-0 only population into which we added larger-bodied conspecifics midexperiment. In the continuous presence of larger conspecifics, age-0 rainbow trout spatial distribution was skewed toward littoral and benthic habitats which had low abundances of their primary prey (zooplankton). The opposite pattern was observed in the experimental lake devoid of larger-bodied conspecifics where the largest proportion of the age-0 class was found in the open-water limnetic habitat where their prey was most abundant. The change in spatial distribution of age-0 rainbow trout in the lake with a midseason addition of larger-bodied conspecifics was consistent with a treatment effect. This addition effect was weakened by a significant ontogenetic change in spatial distribution from littoral to benthic to pelagic habitats as the age-0 rainbow trout grew, and the strength of the change was inversely related to the intensity of interactions with conspecifics. This study provides experimental evidence that the risk of interactions with larger-bodied conspecifics is the process that controls the ontogeny of habitat use by young fish in lakes.","Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; Univ British Columbia, British Columbia Minist Fisheries, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Post, JR (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",jrpost@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,41,18,19,0,3,"CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS",OTTAWA,"1200 MONTREAL ROAD, BUILDING M-55, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",0706-652X,,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

Efforts to control the pest and the thrips-vectored tospoviruses with calendar applications of broad-spectrum insecticides have been unsuccessful. The result has been a classic 3-R situation: resistance to numerous insecticides; resurgence of the western flower thrips populations as a result of natural predators and native competitor thrips being eliminated; replacement by various other pests. This paper reports on integrated pest management programs for fruiting vegetables that are effective, economical, ecologically sound and sustainable. RESULTS: The components include the following: define pest status (economic thresholds); increase biotic resistance (natural enemies and competition); integrate preventive and therapeutic tactics (scouting, ultraviolet-reflective technologies, biological control, compatible insecticides, companion plants and fertility); vertically integrate the programs with other pests; continually communicate latest science-based management tactics with end-users. CONCLUSION: These programs have been widely implemented in Florida and have significantly improved the management of western flower thrips and thrips-transmitted viruses.

It has been suggested that individuals who gain fewer benefits may only join groups due to constraints on resources. These individuals would prefer to associate loosely with a group, associate strongly with a few preferred individuals and avoid despotic individuals. Alternatively, if joining a group is the optimum decision due to advantages gained from cohesion, individuals may exhibit decreased preferences regarding with whom they associate. We tested these ideas by analysing the social networks of wild winter groups of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) in relation to experimental manipulation of resource distribution: three feeders 5m apart (individuals can maintain contact with the group while also following their social preferences), 40m apart (increased risk of losing contact while following preferences) and 130m apart (extremely difficult to follow preferences without losing cohesion). If preferential associations are more important than cohesion, we predicted fewer but stronger connections with decreasing distance between feeders. Dynamic network analysis revealed that distance treatments did change the number of above average strength associations. However, stability of individual centrality was found to decrease when resources were close together and network structure remained similar overall. This suggests individuals maintain cohesion even when alternative foraging choices are available nearby but associate more selectively when given the opportunity. Our results indicate that while individuals will attempt to follow their preferential associations where possible, these are insufficient to cause breakdown in cohesion, possibly due to costs of losing contact with the group.Significance statementAnimals must compromise between associating with preferred individuals and following group consensus. The importance of social preferences can help infer animals' reasons for joining a group. If group cohesion brings benefits, following group consensus may be more important than individuals' social preferences. Alternatively, if groups form simply due to lack of resources, following social preferences may be more important than maintaining group cohesion, depending on the costs of losing contact with the group. We examined this by looking at social network structure of black-capped chickadees in relation to resource distribution, expecting changes in network structure as it became easier or harder to exhibit social preferences. We found individuals had fewer strong associations when resources were closer, meaning that networks were more differentiated than when resources were further apart. This suggests that individuals associated more selectively when possible, though this did not appear to change overall network structure.","[Evans, Julian C.; Morand-Ferron, Julie] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 9B2, Canada","Evans, JC (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 9B2, Canada.",jevansbio@gmail.com,"Morand-Ferron, Julie/AAW-7022-2021","Morand-Ferron, Julie/0000-0001-5186-7710",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [435596-2013]; Canadian Foundation for Innovation Leader Opportunity Fund [31929]; Human Frontiers Science ProgramHuman Frontier Science Program [RGP0006/2015],"This work was funded by a Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC; grant number #435596-2013 to JMF), Canadian Foundation for Innovation Leader Opportunity Fund (grant number #31929 to JMF) and a Human Frontiers Science Program Grant (RGP0006/2015 to JMF).",,94,6,6,3,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,1432-0762,,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Similar to many lakes and reservoirs in the western United States, lake trout were introduced into Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming. Previous studies showed that lake trout reduced the population and altered the size structure of native Yellowstone cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri in Yellowstone Lake, but we sought to determine the degree to which lake trout predation changed lower trophic levels. We predicted that the structure of lower trophic levels would change in conformance with trophic cascade theory because Yellowstone cutthroat trout consume zooplankton. We compared zooplankton and phytoplankton assemblages between the period when Yellowstone cutthroat trout were abundant and the period after they declined. As predicted by trophic cascade theory, zooplankton biomass shifted from being dominated by copepods before lake trout introduction to being dominated by cladocerans after lake trout introduction, with zooplankton body lengths 17% longer after introduction. Vertical water clarity increased by 1.6 m because of a twofold decrease in chlorophyll a and a three- to sevenfold decrease in phytoplankton biovolume. Thus, the introduction of lake trout and subsequent decline of Yellowstone cutthroat trout likely altered lower trophic levels in Yellowstone Lake. Trophic cascades may be common in western U.S. lakes and reservoirs where native salmonids are present and where lake trout have been introduced.","[Tronstad, Lusha M.; Hall, Robert O., Jr.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Koel, Todd M.] Ctr Resources, Fisheries & Aquat Sci Program, Yellowstone Natl Pk, WY 82190 USA; [Gerow, Ken G.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Stat, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Tronstad, LM (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Wyoming Nat Divers Database, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",tronstad@uwyo.edu,,,Environmental Protection AgencyUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [R-82942601-0]; University of Wyoming-NPS; Jackson Hole One Fly Foundation-National Fish and Wildlife Federation,"Thanks to Christine Fisher, Heather Thon, Jessie Julien, Liz O'Connor, Don Alzner, Lusha Alzner, Bryan Tronstad, and Lisa Kunza for helping with sample collection and processing.

This approach has been widely used to evaluate the interaction of biotic variables, and less often biotic and abiotic variables. Although simulated pond communities offer unusually attractive properties for evaluating the effects of xenobiotics on aquatic ecosystems, this approach has received only limited attention as a potential model system for studying the effects of toxicants on amphibian communities. We provide a summary of results and experimental designs from past studies in order to illustrate the general protocols used and complex interactions between biotic and abiotic variables that can be simulated in artificial pond communities. We recommend that community ecologists who make use of this system generally become more aware of the importance of abiotic factors in pond simulations, and that they model the abiotic parameters of the particular system that they are attempting to simulate. We strongly recommend the use of this experimentally tractable system for aquatic community ecotoxicological research, since it is through such a multispecies, top-down simulation approach that we can begin to understand the processes by which xenobiotic factors impact more complex natural systems.

Here we show that roach (Rutilus rutilus L.), a common cyprinid in Swedish boreal lakes, often break the mandibles of ingested Chaoborus larvae into smaller fragments. The presence/absence of roach in historic fish communities could therefore possibly be determined from the proportion of fragmented Chaoborus mandibles in lake sediments, which we assessed using the following three approaches. (1) Roach that were fed Chaoborus larvae in laboratory aquaria evacuated a significantly higher fraction of fragmented prey mandibles than perch (Perca fluviatilis L.). (2) Surface sediments from lakes in an acidified region in southwestern Sweden showed significantly higher proportions of fragmented mandibles for lakes containing roach compared to lakes devoid of cyprinid fish. (3) A paleo-study in Lake Lysevatten, into which roach were introduced in the 1880s and were extirpated in the 1960s, showed significantly higher proportions of fragmented mandibles in sediment layers from the roach period. We conclude that mandible fragmentation was related to roach presence, and propose that the proportion of fragmented Chaoborus mandibles in lake sediments may provide important information when historical cyprinid alterations are of interest, as in paleo-studies on acidification, eutrophication, or fish introductions.","[Palm, Fredrik] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Zool, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [El-Daoushy, Farid] Uppsala Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Angstrom Lab, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Svensson, Jan-Erik] Medins Biol AB, S-43533 Molnlycke, Sweden","Palm, F (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Dept Zool, Box 463, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",fredrik.palm@zool.gu.se,,,FORMASSwedish Research Council Formas [2002-0205],"We are grateful for the assistance of Omar Prieto Santamarta, Kristian Bergstrom, and Andreas Jonsson in field or laboratory, and we also thank Fredrik Nilsson at the County Administrative Board of Vastra Gotaland for supplying data on test fishing and performing additional sediment sampling.

Recent advances in the theory predict that the length of exposure to good or bad conditions governs risk allocation, and thus habitat choice, when patterns of environmental risk are autocorrelated in time. We investigate the effects of these factors with controlled experiments on a small soil arthropod (Folsomia candida). We subjected animals to nine temporally autocorrelated 16-day feeding treatments varying in both the proportion (0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) and duration (short, medium and long intervals) of time when food was present and absent. We assessed foraging trade-offs by the animals' choice of occupying a risky dry habitat with food (rich) versus a safe moist habitat with no food (poor). Irrespective of autocorrelation in conditions, the proportion of time spent with no food primarily determined habitat selection by these collembolans. Our results imply an energetic threshold below which F. candida are forced to forage in rich and risky habitat despite the possibility of mortality through desiccation. The link to energetic thresholds suggests the possibility of employing state-dependent habitat selection as a leading indicator of habitat change.","[Bannister, Allison E.; Morris, Douglas W.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada","Morris, DW (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Dept Biol, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada.",dmorris@lakeheadu.ca,,,Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [116430-2013],This research was supported by Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council [grant number 116430-2013].,,36,5,5,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1565-9801,2224-4662,,ISR J ECOL EVOL,Isr.

The experiment was conducted in April and May 2008 and consisted of two treatments in which corals were either undamaged (controls) or damaged through gouging of tissue and skeleton in a discrete spot mimicking the effects of corallivorous fishes that utilize an excavating feeding mode. The two groups of corals were incubated for 10 days in microcosms that crossed levels of temperature (26.7 and 29.6A degrees C) and flow (6 and 21 cm s(-1)), and the response assessed as overall colony growth (change in weight), dark-adapted quantum yield of PSII (F (v)/F (m)), and healing of the gouged areas. The influence of damage on growth was affected by temperature, but not by flow. When averaged across flow treatments, damage promoted growth by 25% at 26.7A degrees C, but caused a 25% inhibition at 29.6A degrees C. The damage also affected F (v)/F (m) in a pattern that differed between flow speeds, with a 10% reduction at 6 cm s(-1), but a 4% increase at 21 cm s(-1). Regardless of damage, F (v)/F (m) at 21 cm s(-1) was 11% lower at 26.7A degrees C than at 29.6A degrees C, but was unaffected by temperature at 6 cm s(-1). The lesions declined in area at similar rates (4-5% day(-1)) under all conditions, although the tissue within them regained a normal appearance most rapidly at 26.7A degrees C and 6 cm s(-1). These findings show that the response of poritid corals to sub-lethal damage is dependent partly on abiotic conditions, and they are consistent with the hypothesis that following damage, calcification and photosynthesis can compete for metabolites necessary for repair, with the outcome affected by flow-mediated mass transfer. These results may shed light upon the ways in which poritid corals respond to biting by certain corallivorous fishes.","[Edmunds, Peter J.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Lenihan, Hunter S.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Edmunds, PJ (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.",peter.edmunds@csun.edu,,"Edmunds, Peter/0000-0002-9039-9347",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE 0417412]; Gordon and Betty Moore FoundationGordon and Betty Moore Foundation,"This research was supported by grant OCE 0417412 from the National Science Foundation and gifts from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and was completed under a research permit issued by the French Polynesian Ministry of Research.

Much has been learned in recent years regarding the influence of environmental conditions on top-down and bottom-up effects acting on insect herbivores. Temporal variation in environmental conditions, however, has gone largely unstudied in spite of undoubtedly strong influences in most systems. 2. A 2-year study was conducted to examine the legacy effects of previous manipulations of host plant quality and parasitism pressure on the top-down and bottom-up effects influencing population densities of the salt marsh planthopper Pissonotus quadripustulatus . 3. For 10 months in 1998, a 2 x 2 factorial experiment was carried out, in which host plant quality was increased by the addition of nitrogen fertiliser, and parasitism pressure was decreased through the use of yellow sticky traps. This was followed by 2 months in the winter with no treatment applications. Treatments were then reversed in 1999 for a further 10 months. 4. In 1998, fertilisation treatments increased plant quality significantly, which resulted in strong effects on P. quadripustulatus density. Parasitism reduction treatments had weaker and time-dependent effects on the herbivore, increasing planthopper density in late summer and autumn. 5. After 2 months without treatments, previous fertilisation treatments were still influencing all response variables measured significantly. The legacy effects of fertilisation persisted for at least 7 months for the host plant, and at least 5 months for the herbivore and parasitoid. 6. Fertilisation treatments in 1999 increased P. quadripustulatus density by approximately the same percentage as in 1998, suggesting that previous reductions in parasitism had no influence on herbivore responses to increased nutrients. Parasitism reduction treatments in 1999, however, resulted in greater increases in herbivore density than in 1998, suggesting that previous increases in nutrients enabled greater responses to reductions in top-down pressure. 7. The results show that the top-down effects of parasitism attenuated more quickly than did the bottom-up effects of increased plant quality through greater nutrient availability. They also suggest that the recent history of nutrient status in an ecosystem may be important in determining the relative strengths of top-down and bottom-up forces.","Univ S Florida, Dept Biol, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Moon, DC (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol & Microbiol, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA.",moond@uwosh.edu,,,,,,39,7,7,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6946,1365-2311,,ECOL ENTOMOL,Ecol.

However, summer declines in the egg ratio of K. taurocephala were observed during each year. The reduction in rotifer populations simultaneously with decreased egg ratios suggested that population declines were caused by food limitation. Food-addition experiments conducted in situ in small enclosures indicated that food was limiting for K. cochlearis when its populations were declining, but not during other periods of the year.

Therefore, FCOY may avoid areas frequented by adult males during the mating season. The main aim of this study was to identify landscape features (i.e., structure, composition, and human footprint) that may differentiate the habitat use of FCOY in the small bear population of the Cantabrian Mountains (northwestern Spain; 2001-2016) from (a) areas frequented by females with yearlings, because older cubs are at less risk of infanticide than cubs-of-the-year, and (b) bear mating areas (i.e., the riskiest areas for FCOY because of the presence of adult males). During the first months after den emergence (Apr-Jun), FCOY settled in the roughest areas of the Cantabrian Mountains at most spatial scales. This settlement pattern might represent a behavioral adaptation of FCOY to reduce the risk of encounters with males during the mating season. However, FCOY also settled in similar landscapes to those used by adult bears during the mating season, which may increase the likelihood of risky encounters. Indeed, we observed a spatial overlap between observed locations of FCOY and mating areas, which may help explain the high frequency of infanticide observed in the Cantabrian Mountains. We hypothesize that the need for both shelter and food in early spring may 'trap' FCOY in otherwise favorable areas that overlap with mating areas. This may occur predominately in small and confined bear populations, such as the one in the Cantabrian Mountains, where a restricted range and limited habitat availability might prevent FCOY from avoiding risky areas successfully.","[Penteriani, Vincenzo; Zarzo-Arias, Alejandra; Delgado, Maria del Mar; Dalerum, Fredrick] CSIC UO PA, Res Unit Biodivers UMIB, Campus Mieres, Mieres 33600, Spain; [Dalerum, Fredrick] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Dalerum, Fredrick] Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Dept Zool & Entomol, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa; [Gurarie, Eliezer] Univ Maryland, Dept Biol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Peon Torre, Paloma; Sanchez Corominas, Teresa; Vazquez, Victor M.] Consejeria Desarrollo Rural & Recursos Nat, Oviedo 33005, Spain; [Vazquez, Victor M.] Real Inst Estudios Asturianos RIDEA, Oviedo 33005, Spain; [Vazquez Garcia, Pablo] Univ Valencia, Inst Cavanilles Biodiversidad & Biol Evolut, Valencia 46980, Spain; [Ordiz, Andres] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Fac Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway","Penteriani, V (corresponding author), CSIC UO PA, Res Unit Biodivers UMIB, Campus Mieres, Mieres 33600, Spain.",v.penteriani@csic.es,"Zarzo-Arias, Alejandra/AAT-5513-2021","Zarzo-Arias, Alejandra/0000-0001-5496-0144; Ordiz, Andres/0000-0002-6141-8457","Excellence Project - Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MINECO) [CGL2017-82782-P]; Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER, EU); International Association for Bear Research and Management (IBA) [IBA-RG_16_2016]","We specially thank D.

However, most experimental studies of assortative mating do not take place in multiple natural environments, and hence, they ignore its potential context dependence. We implemented an experiment in which two populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta) with different natural flow regimes were placed into semi-natural stream channels under two different artificial flow regimes. Natural reproduction was allowed, and reproductive isolation was measured by means of parentage assignment to compare within-population vs. between-population male-female mating and relative offspring production. For both metrics, reproductive isolation was highly context dependent: no isolation was evident under one flow regime, but strong isolation was evident under the other flow regime. These patterns were fully driven by variance in the mating success of males from one of the two populations. Our results highlight how reproductive isolation through assortative mating can be strongly context dependent, which could have dramatic consequences for patterns of gene flow and speciation under environmental change.","[Gauthey, Z.; Tentelier, C.; Labonne, J.] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, ECOBIOP, INRA, F-64310 St Pee Sur Nivelle, France; [Hendry, A.
